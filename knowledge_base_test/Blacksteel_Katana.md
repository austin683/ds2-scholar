### How to get Blacksteel Katana in Dark Souls 2

  * Dropped by [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") and [Alonne Knight Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") at the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") and [Memory of the Old Iron King](/Memory+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the Old Iron King").

### DS2 Blacksteel Katana Hints & Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Moveset is identical to Iaito from Dark Souls, which the strong attack is quickdraw slash.
  * You can speed up the strong attack quickdraw by wielding it with both hand, roll, light attack and then strong attack. (2H -> Roll -> 2HR1 -> 2HR2)
  * And therefore, you can go for this combo: Roll -> 2HR1 -> 2HR2 -> 2HR2 (slash, quickdraw with delay canceled, thrust)
  * Blacksteel Katana keeps S DEX scaling with most infusions; however this is only visual; the actual scaling is closer to B (~50% of S scaling).

### DS2 Blacksteel Katana Trivia

  * As a promotion for the [Crown of the Old Iron King DLC](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King"), a special white-hilted Blacksteel Katana was put inside the Majula mansion chest. This promotion has long since expired, and unless by trading, this version of the weapon is no longer accessible through conventional means.
  * The weapon is modeled after the _chokutō_ , an early Japanese sword that predates the katana. The  _chokutō_ has a single-edged straight blade and sometimes lacks fittings such as the _tsuba_ (the handguard).
  * Before SotFS expansion, the flavor text read:   
  
“Blacksteel katana wielded by Alonne Knights. One of the sturdiest types of katana, preferred by masters of the quick-draw. In the heyday of his land, the Old Iron King fancied entertaining dubious and eccentric guests from faraway lands. Most of them were charlatans, but amongst the riff-raff were true masters of authentic and refined arts.”
