**Sun Sword** is a **[Straight Sword](/Straight+Swords "Dark Souls 2 Straight Swords")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. **Sun Sword** is a Straight Sword obtainable by reaching Rank 2 in the Heirs of the Sun covenant and offering 20 Sunlight Medals. Upgradeable with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10, the **Sun Sword** features a thrusting-heavy moveset, similar to the [Fume Sword](/Fume+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sword"). However, the two-handed attack is a slashing move while roll attacks remain thrusting.

> A well-forged long sword.  
>   
> Of unknown origin, and exhibiting no special power, but sturdily crafted.  
>   
> Perhaps it does not live up to its name, but nevertheless, merely wielding this sword seems to cause warmth to well up within one's bosom.

### How to get Sun Sword in Dark Souls 2

  * Reward for reaching Rank 2 of [Heirs of the Sun](/Heirs+of+the+Sun "Dark Souls 2 Heirs of the Sun") covenant. (Offer 20 [Sunlight Medals](/Sunlight+Medal "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Medal"))

### DS2 Sun Sword Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Like the [Fume Sword](/Fume+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sword"), it has a full suite of thrusting attacks with the exception of the 2 handed R2, which is a slashing attack (roll attacks are still thrusting, however).
  * You can only acquire one Sun Sword per character as covenant progress does not reset with NG+ and beyond, unless another player drops their Sun Sword in your world.
  * When upgraded to +10 this weapon does 350 physical damage with 40 strength and 40 dexterity. 175 base + 210 with scaling.
  * The Sun Sword suffers greatly in parameter bonuses after infusion. For example: despite the lightning sun sword having a scaling rating of B and C on strength and dexterity, its physical scaling is actually worse than Lightning Heide Knight Sword's C and D (when both weapons at +10 are equipped at the same time, the Sun Sword offers less bonus physical damage than the heide sword). It is therefore discouraged to infuse this weapon, even mundane.
  * One-handed strong attack does a thrusting-type attack unlike most other straight swords.
  * Not to be confused with the miracle [Sunlight Blade](/Sunlight+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Blade").
  * **Trivia** : It's based on Sunlight Straight Sword from _Dark Souls_ , which was wielded by [Solaire of Astora](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Solaire+of+Astora "Dark Souls 2 Solaire of Astora"), its one handed strong attack is also a thrusting move.
  * The game incorrectly lists attack type as only Slash when it clearly has both Slash and Thrust attacks.
