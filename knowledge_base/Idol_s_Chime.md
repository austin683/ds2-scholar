**Idol's Chime** is a **[Sacred Chime](/Chimes "Dark Souls 2 Chimes")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Idol's Chime** serves as a catalyst for [Miracles](/Miracles "Dark Souls 2 Miracles") and [Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes"). You can acquire it by either speaking to [Licia of Lindelt](/Licia+of+Lindelt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindelt") with at least 30 Faith or by killing her during your first encounter with her or when invading with the [Crushed Eye Orb](/Crushed+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Crushed Eye Orb"). The **Idol's Chime** is considered the earliest hex-dedicated chime that players can obtain if they raise their faith enough. When combined with Felkin's hexes, it can be very powerful. However, it is not as effective as the Dark [Black Witch's Staff](/Black+Witch's+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch's Staff") or Dark [Caitha's Chime](/Caitha's+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Caitha's Chime").
