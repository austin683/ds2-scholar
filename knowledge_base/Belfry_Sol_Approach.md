#  Belfry Sol Approach

* * *

##  Location:

This bonfire is located in the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep) interior, beyond the bridge guarded by two Iron Knuckles. Turning left immediately as you enter the large chamber, pass through the door. Insert a [Pharros Lockstone](/Pharros+Lockstone) into the wall to reveal a passage and ladder. Scaling this ladder will allow you to access the bonfire on the upper level.   
Note that this bonfire is located in a small pit inside the Iron Keep. When you first arrive, it appears that the only option is to climb the ladder and travel through the entirety of the Belfry Sol in order to proceed with the Iron Keep, however this is false. Upon climbing the ladder, move to the opposite side of the hole in the floor you just climbed through, aim yourself a little to the right (towards the corner of the hole/the right of the ladder), and roll forward. It might take a couple of tries but it's very possible to land on the ledge above the bonfire pit and continue with the Iron Keep. Othing to bear in mind with this is that climbing the ladder will aggro the first bellkeeper who will move towards you slowly, so try to get the roll done as quickly as possible or take him out first.
