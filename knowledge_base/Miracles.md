**Miracles** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a type of [Magic](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic") that mostly Heals or Buffs a player. Most **Miracle** spells are self-buffs which augments the user's effectiveness in battle. The catalysts for casting miracles are called [Chimes](/Chimes "Dark Souls 2 Chimes").

### What are Miracles in Dark Souls 2?

**Miracles** are spells that primarily grant Heals, Buffs, or Defense to a player. Some Miracles have offensive capabilities, and they have high damage output, but most of the spells will focus on buffing the player in some way. A certain amount of Faith and a Chime as a catalyst is needed in order to cast most Miracles, though there are weapons like the [Mace of the Insolent](/Mace+of+the+Insolent "Dark Souls 2 Mace of the Insolent") and [Black Witch's Staff](/Black+Witch's+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch's Staff") that can also cast miracle spells.

Most Miracles tend to use Lightning-based attacks. Most enemies you'll encounter throughout your journey in the main story are not resistant to Lightning damage, so having a reliable form of elemental Lightning damage can always be useful. Take advantage of Waterlogged enemies as they can take more damage from lightning.

### Best Miracles in Dark Souls 2

  * [Sunlight Blade](/Sunlight+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Blade") \- This spell coats the player's weapon in lightning, dealing lightning damage whenever the weapon is used to attack. This is great for having an extra boost to your damage output.
  * [Sunlight Spear](/Sunlight+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Spear") \- This spell is the final evolution of the [Lightning Spear](/Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Lightning Spear"), this spell is best for opponents who tend to keep their distance.

If the enemy is in any body of water, it will conduct a stronger AoE that will also affect enemies within the blast radius. The highest damaging miracle in the game.
  * [Great Heal](/Great+Heal "Dark Souls 2 Great Heal") \- A good healing spell is essential for any miracle user. The Great Heal can used by just about any builds as it only requires a few points put into Faith and Attunement. This spell casts instant heal to recover HP instantly, useful when you've encountered a tough opponent and you're in a situation where you can't die just yet.
  * [Bountiful Sunlight](/Bountiful+Sunlight "Dark Souls 2 Bountiful Sunlight") \- This spell also casts healing to the user, but instead of healing instantly, it heals over time.

This spell is useful when you are up against multiple opponents. This miracles also deals high damage since it scales with Faith.
