**Black Dragon Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A shield that appears in ancient legends.  
Strangely shaped, and said to be crafted from the talons of the black dragon._

     _The legend of the pale dragon is told in various locales, but each account is fragmentary. Very rarely is the black dragon mentioned,  
and some say that it is merely an embellishment adopted in later retellings of the story."_

### Acquired From

  * [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine"): Can be dropped from the [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight") on the stairs leading up to the [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon"). 

### Black Dragon Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Requires [petrified dragon bones](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to upgrade.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * The pale dragon referred to in its description is likely [Seath the Scaleless](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Seath+the+Scaleless "Dark Souls 2 Seath the Scaleless") from _Dark Souls_ , while the black dragon would be [Kalameet](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Dragon+Kalameet "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Kalameet") from the _Dark Souls_ DLC.
