### The Cave in the Cave of the Dead

From the **[Priestess' Chamber](/Priestess%27+Chamber "Dark Souls 2 Priestess%27 Chamber") bonfire **in [Shulva](/Shulva+-+Sanctum+City "Dark Souls 2 Shulva - Sanctum City"), enter the cave and at the end of the corridor to find a fog gate. Cross it to enter the **Cave of the Dead**. Drop down the ledge, and if you are in human form, find two NPC summon signs for [Rapacious Andrei ](/Rapacious+Andrei "Dark Souls 2 Rapacious Andrei"), and [Ruined Alfis](/Ruined+Alfis "Dark Souls 2 Ruined Alfis"). Drop down the next ledge and you will find a room with 3 [Sanctum Soldiers](/Sanctum+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier"), many Petrifying (red-eyed) Statues, and a few holes in the ground. Kill the enemies before dropping down the second hole on the right.

You will be in a room FULL of Petrifying Statues, and a few [Poison Statue Clusters](/Poison+Statue+Cluster "Dark Souls 2 Poison Statue Cluster") and [Sanctum Soldiers](/Sanctum+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier"). Navigation is hard, but there is only one exit in the room, the aforementioned hole the player has to drop is the closest one to the exit. In the room there is a metal chest that contains 3x [ Petrified Something ](/Petrified+Something "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Something"), a corpse with 2x [ Brightbug](/Brightbug "Dark Souls 2 Brightbug"), and another holding 3x [ Bonfire Ascetic ](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic").

When you find the exit, drop off the ledge. This new room contains 3 [Petrifying Statue Clusters](/Petrifying+Statue+Cluster "Dark Souls 2 Petrifying Statue Cluster"), several Petrifying Statues, a [Cragslipper](/Cragslipper "Dark Souls 2 Cragslipper"), and three 3 [Sanctum Soldiers](/Sanctum+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier") beyond it.

After killing all these enemies, enter the fog gate for the boss fight(s):

Boss Fight: [Graverobber, Varg, and Cerah ](/Graverobber%2C+Varg%2C+and+Cerah "Dark Souls 2 Graverobber%2C Varg%2C and Cerah").

### Calm after the Storm

Killing these bosses will give you a total of:

  * 3x [ Twinkling Titanite ](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")
  * 3x [ Petrified Dragon Bone ](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone")
  * 1x [Titanite Slab ](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab")

Go to the opposite side of the entrance of the room and you will find a chest containing a [ Flower Skirt ](/Flower+Skirt "Dark Souls 2 Flower Skirt"), and a corpse holding 3x [ Blackweed Balm ](/Blackweed+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Blackweed Balm"). To exit, you can simply use a [ Homeward Bone ](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone") or [Aged Feather ](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") or fall down the hole in the end to drop into the area where you found the [Dark Greatsword](/Dark+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Dark Greatsword") hex.

From here go back to the body that had the [Torches](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch") and jump to the platform below. From the platform roll down to the entrance of the building, take the elevator and you'll arrive back at the bonfire.
