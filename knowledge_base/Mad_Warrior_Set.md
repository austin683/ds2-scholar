**Mad Warrior Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

  
  
  
_"[armor piece] from an unknown foreign land._   
_King Vendrick called upon powers from beyond his borders in an attempt to stave off the curse. Perhaps they belonged to one of his guests."_

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by dark spirit [Mad Warrior](/Mad+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Mad Warrior") in [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol").
  * Dropped by a group of dark spirits [Prowlers](/Prowlers "Dark Souls 2 Prowlers") in [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower").

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Mad Warrior only appears when members of the [Bell Keepers](/Bell+Keeper "Dark Souls 2 Bell Keeper") covenant pass through Belfry Sol. Drops are not guaranteed, but it's certain that he will drop the entire set and [Berserker Blade](/Berserker+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Berserker Blade") without repetitions once per each NG cycle and then will drop nothing (but will keep respawning).
  * Mask grants +2 ADP.
  * The mask bears a striking resemblance to Predator's mask.
