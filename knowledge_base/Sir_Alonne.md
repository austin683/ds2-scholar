### Attacks
    
    
    | Attack Name | Attack Description | Counter Measures |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Katana Lunge | He points the blade to the ground and subsequently lunge and go for uppercut slash. | Prepare yourself when he points his sword to the ground. If you can dodge the charge, there's lots of time after his swing for you to attack. |
    | 3 Hit Combos | He swings his katana for three times, two horizontal slash and third swing will be either a lunge or a horizontal slash. |  |
    | Dark Wave | He swings his sword horizontally, launching out a wave similar to the wave charges seen on the Dark Greatsword . | Like the charged stab, this attack has an identical sound cue, and the beam can be easily avoided by sidestepping when distance is adequate. |
    | Life Drain | He charges for a second before stabbing you and draining some health and buffing his sword, it only activates when the host is stabbed. / This attack cannot be blocked and is extremely hard to dodge. | There's a sound cue when he charges up the stab akin to a high-pitched ringing. When you hear it, be ready to dodge. |
    | Katana Jump Stab | He jumps high into the air and comes crashing down, deals high damage. It occurs more often when he has half health left. |  |
    | Parry/Riposte | He will hold his sword to his left and pointing forwards and to the right for a while. Attacking him during this state will result in your attack being parried and he will stab you while you're on the ground. | Don't attack him while his sword is on his left. |
    

### Sir Alonne Strategy in DKS2

####  STR/Heavy Tank Solo Strategy

This is a rather simple strategy for heavy builds: equip Havel's Greatshield and an Ultra Greatsword/Hammer buffed with what you have and with a sweeping roll attack, like the [Greatsword](/Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Greatsword"), Fume's Sword or my personal choice the [King's Ultra Greatsword](/King%27s+Ultra+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Ultra Greatsword"). Wear light armor and/or the Soldier Ring to get below 50% equip load. This is crucial because you will roll a lot. You block every close range attack while circling him left, he usually does not more than three strikes which Havel can handle well. The exception is the Life Drain pierce attempt, this can not be blocked and should always be evaded, same for the magic attacks. Never let your shield down except for Stamina Regeneration after an attack series and raise the shield immediately when you see that he's attacking again, even if the stamina bar is only half full. The only time where you can safely attack is when he glides from the other side of the room to you in an instant and tries to pierce you with the Katana. You have to roll sweep attack through the attack just right before he begins to glide, which damages him while you are safe. But remember to roll from behind the shield, because if you're only a fraction of a second too late, he will stop your roll attempt - either by piercing into your shield or your flesh. There are two timings for the glide attack: a quick one where he just pulls the sword horizontally back, and a slow, trickier one where he pulls the sword slower and in a slight sweeping motion back. I prefer to block the later because when you roll too early you die.   
  
And that's it, you only have to learn the timing of one attack. If you manage to roll through his glide attack you can also safely heal. It's the safest spot to heal in the fight, because he is locked for 2 seconds after the glide attack and he always jumps back when you're in his back, which gives you 3-4 seconds to heal. Also beware that this will be a long fight, Dexterity Characters might find more safe spots to attack and end the boss quicker, but for a slow tank with UGS and Havel's shield it's safest to exploit the window after his glide attack.

#### Dodging Strategy

If your build is a power stance dodge build, the fight can be a breeze if you simply keep dodging to your right, as well as hitting him while he's positioned on your left. His swinging arm is his right arm, meaning he usually swings from his right to his left, giving you an edge in the fight. This goes for his lifesteal attack wind up as well, because if you roll to your left, he has somewhat better tracking than if you roll to the right (he missed me with every single lifesteal wind up this way, whereas he landed a couple on me if I rolled to the left). A single roll to the back usually messes up his tracking on sliding attacks, although you can opt to roll forward and to the right, getting behind him for a couple free hits - this takes practice however. Try to close the distance at least a little when he jumps backwards, this seems to prevent his sliding wind ups most of the time (needs more testing from other sources).

#### Great Heal Strategy

If your build has high attunement and faith, you can summon two white phantoms and leave the job to them, stand next to the phantoms and heal them with [Great Heal](/Great+Heal "Dark Souls 2 Great Heal") miracle constantly while blocking or dodging Alonne. Since Alonne is distracted, it'll dispatch him painlessly provided if you can dodge the Katana Jump Stab.

Note - This increases the boss defenses significantly and it'll be much harder to beat him normally, so make sure not to let the NPC's die.
