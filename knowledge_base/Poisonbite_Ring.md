**Poisonbite Ring** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in **Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)**. The **Poisonbite Ring** , part of the distinctive "bite" ring series, boosts poison resistance. The shared, unsettling design of these rings hints at a common origin. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> One of the several "bite" rings, known for their peculiar design. Increases poison resistance. The similar, oddly disturbing design of these rings suggests a common source. Whoever the master craftsman was, he clearly knew his trade.
