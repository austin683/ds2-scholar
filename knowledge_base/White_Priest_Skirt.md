**White Priest Skirt** is a **Legging** and a part of [White Priest Set](/White+Priest+Set "Dark Souls 2 White Priest Set") in **Dark Souls 2**.

### White Priest Skirt Description

"Skirt worn by Drangleic clerics.

The clerics of Drangleic were not viewed with particular reverence, and their positions were only preserved as a nod to tradition.

It is customary for clerics to wear different garb depending on their sex, but the reason for this practice is unknown. This is a men's skirt."
