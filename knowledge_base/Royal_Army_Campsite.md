##  Special Notes:

To get the treasure in the broken building you must destroy the cover on the well nearby then jump into the well from the ledge near it.   
New game plus also spawns two non-reoccurring larger boars in the area, a bonfire acsetic does respawn them however they only drop large titanite shards from my knowledge.   
NG+ may also cause The Dukes Dear Freja to spawn after the 4 Armed Peasants in the Chasm before the Church entrance door.   
There is an Illusory Wall just before the Prowling Magus boss fog straight across from the door that leads into the fog room. This leads to an estus flask shard and a red phantom (may only be in NG+).   
After the Prowling Magus boss search to the left of the exit outside the boss room. There will be a ladder leading up to Cromwell the Pardoner and some nice items on the ground surrounding him.   

##  Notable Summoning/PvP Spots:

Benhart of Jugo is a summonable npc in the tent that has the upper armor of a Hollow Soldier, granted you have exhausted all of his dialog from the de-petrification of Rosabeth of Melfia.
