### DS2 Thorned Greatsword Hints and Tips

  * Reinforced with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5. 

  * The strong attack can be used one-handed or two-handed and produces an orange lightning bolt that is fired from the blade consuming 10 durability (5 with [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring")   

    * Lowers durability loss for weapons by 20%, 35% **(+1)** , 50% **(+2)**
    * Lowers durability loss for armor and rings by 20%, 25% **(+1)** , 45% **(+2)**
    * **Durability:** 110, 85 **(+1)** , 70 **(+2)**
    * **Weight:** 0.5, 0.8 **(+1)** , 1.0 **(+2)**
    * Obtained from [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"), [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager")**(+1)** , [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt")**(+2)**. 

  * The player smashes the weapon on the ground while one-handing, but thrusts the sword forward when two-handing.
  * The moveset is almost identical to [Black Knight Greatsword](/Black+Knight+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Black Knight Greatsword").
  * Remember that this strong attack is both a melee attack and a projectile. Hitting someone with the blade of this strong attack deals way more damage than just hitting the projectile part.
  * Use a lightning buff ([Sunlight Blade](/Sunlight+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Blade") or [Gold Pine Resin](/Gold+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Gold Pine Resin")) on this weapon to make it much harder for enemies to predict your strong attack in PvP while increasing your damage. 

  * While not as strong as something like the Throne Defender's Greatsword, this weapon's ranged lightning bolt attacks will often surprise most people, and catch them off guard.
  * The strong attack can be animation cancelled to great effect and will throw off most opponents.
