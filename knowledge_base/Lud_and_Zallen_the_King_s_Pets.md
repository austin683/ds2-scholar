### Lud and Zallen, the King's Pets Information in Dark Souls 2

Two of the King's dear beasts, found in an icy arena in the end of the [Frigid Outskirts](/Frigid+Outskirts "Dark Souls 2 Frigid Outskirts"). Both have less health than [Aava](/Aava%2C+the+King%27s+Pet "Dark Souls 2 Aava%2C the King%27s Pet"), but their damage is the same, and Zallen can go into an enraged state where he deals more damage and suffers less in return, much like the [Smelter demon](/Smelter+demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter demon").

### Dark Souls 2 Lud and Zallen, the King's Pets Strategy

One on one melee strategy   
  
When they are about to do a non-magical attack, walk towards them and roll forward when they launch the attack. If you time it right, they will miss you. After the attack you're either behind or below them and you get an opportunity to strike (or heal).   
  
Once they cast the homing missiles run towards them as fast as possible. If you make it to the back of them, all of them will miss and you get an opportunity to hit him a couple of times. When they are with two, it is best to use the [Brightbug.](/Brightbug "Dark Souls 2 Brightbug") Equip it right before Zallen comes in the arena (that is when Lud is at about 1/3 of his health). Since it takes a while to equip, it is best to use it when Lud does a magical attack. Make sure you are out of reach of the attack and equip it, then you have plenty of time. Once equipped focus on Lud and try to kill him before the effect wears out. Also, before Zallen comes to the arena, it is best to have max health.   
  
When battling both of them at the same time try to use one as a meat shield for another. When caught between them dash near one of them and bait a melee attack to dodge roll behind the cat leaving another in a place where it can't jump on you. Baiting a melee attack is also useful when one of them charges the magical missile attack and the other is near you. Just roll under the melee attack and run fast immediately after it to dodge missiles. This strategy makes you are pretty much far away from both of them when missiles miss you and you have time to turn around and see where they are before they jump attack.   
  
The [magic shield](/magic+shield "Dark Souls 2 magic shield") is a good choice to use in this fight, because it has a very high magic resistance. It doesn't stop 100 % of the physical attacks though.

### Lud and Zallen, the King's Pets Hints in Dark Souls 2

  * Like most bosses that buff (e.g. Smelter Demon), consider using a [Brightbug](/Brightbug "Dark Souls 2 Brightbug") to maintain your hard-earned advantage.
  * Finish off Lud as quickly as you can after Zallen joins the fight.
  * During Zallen's berserk mode he will regenerate hp faster than you can do relative damage. Wait and dodge only for around 30 seconds, and it will wear off and you'll be able to fight him quite easily, if of course, you killed Lud first.
  * Homing magic missile attack can be completely avoid by simply strafing to the right at medium or long range or behind close range.
  * If you get low on health the best way to bait a chance to heal is to get close and when a cat swings his arm roll straight through him to his backside and immediately use a lifegem while walking away.
  * If you kill Zallen first the remaining cat Lud will instead go enraged state when low on health and also learns how to bite jump
