The Rat King** can be encountered in the [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros") and [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") areas. He is the leader of the [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant"), a group dedicated to defending their territory from intruders. The **Rat King** appears as a large, rat-like creature, sitting on a throne surrounded by his loyal subjects.

### Rat King Information in Dark Souls 2

  * Leader of the [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant")
  * After joining, all the enemies in the first part of the tomb leading up to the Rat King will be unattackable and won't respond to your character. The player can force non-covenant members who are travelling through the tomb to invade their world as a Grey Phantom by wearing the [Crest of the Rat.](/Crest+of+the+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Crest of the Rat") They must battle you along with the traps and enemies within the tomb. Upon defeating a Grey Phantom the player is rewarded with a [Rat Tail](/Rat+Tail "Dark Souls 2 Rat Tail") and a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros'+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone")
  * By offering up Rat Tails, the player may progress through the covenant and earn rewards. You may also find Rat Tails from fallen Rats who die due to the Grey Phantom invading your world.
  * If you kill him/make him hostile, you will be evicted from the Rat King Covenant. He drops nothing except a small amount of souls when he dies, making this a usually less favored option.
  * Killing him in one location will result in his gravestone eventually spawning as a way to still join his covenant.

### Rat King Dialogue

**\- When first met**  
Leave this place, human.  
We have no time for thy kind.  
Humans bring nothing but filth.

**\- When talking a second time without a Rat Tail in the inventory**  
Thy welcome wearest thin.  
Leave this place.

**\- When talking a second time with a Rat Tail in the inventory**  
Is that a Rat Tail, human?  
Thou'st one of mine rat burrows conquered. This will not go unnoticed.  
Rejoice, for the right to serve me is now thine.  
Since thou'rt human still…  
Permit me ask. Wilt thou thy human soul surrender, and pledge thyself to me?  
Swearest thou by the sweet-tempered sludge that laps at our bosoms?

  1. **Answer "yes"**  
Thou hast the eyes of one who perceiveth true beauty.  
Human, thou mayest serve.  
Take this ring. It was forged by a human who was once among us.  
The ring draws to thee those who would defile our burrow.  
Wear the ring whenever thou'rt near.  
And destroy those who would dare provoke our ire.  
I will grant unto thee all thou should so desire.  
I prithee serve with a true rat's honour.
  2. **Answer "no"**  
Of course. Humans are all alike.  
Get thee gone. We will tolerate thy stench no longer.

**\- When talking a second time after disagreeing to join covenant**  
Thou return'st?  
I am not unkind. Shouldst thou forbear thy ways, audience shall be thine.  
Swearest thou to serve me true?

  1. **Answer "yes"**  
Thou hast the eyes of one who perceiveth true beauty.  
Human, thou mayest serve.  
Take this ring. It was forged by a human who was once among us.  
The ring draws to thee those who would defile our burrow.  
Wear the ring whenever thou'rt near.  
And destroy those who would dare provoke our ire.  
I will grant unto thee all thou should so desire.  
I prithee serve with a true rat's honour.
  2. **Answer "no"**  
Then we need consort no longer.

**\- When talking to open interaction menu**  
Speak thy mind, servant.

**\- Using 'Talk' option**  
My servant, tell me the way of things.  
There has been much honour in thy service, despite the human blood coursing thy veins.  
I am merciful, and trust in thee as I would any rat.

**\- Using 'Talk' option**  
The insolent fools line up to trample upon our burrows.  
My servant, dispatch these invaders, and thy reward will be handsome indeed.

**\- Using 'Talk' option**  
Knowest thee of the Lockstones? Those odd contraptions fashioned by human hand long ago.  
Thou art human, and thence able.  
I know thy kind, base plotters and schemers all. Put these contraptions to thy employ 'gainst thy foe.

**\- When talking after abandoning covenant**  
Why comest thou here, human?  
Thy treason will not go unpunished.  
Be gone. I will gaze upon thee no longer.  
_(Prompt appears asking if you want to rejoin the covenant)_

  1. **Answer "yes"**  
My servant, do not disappoint me.
  2. **Answer "no"**  
Traitors will not be forgiven. Get thee gone.

**\- When leaving after buying something**  
My servant, destroy my enemies.

**\- When leaving without buying anything**  
My servant, do not disappoint me.

**\- When walking off without closing the menu**  
Go then, my servant.

**\- Reach Rank 1 in Rat King covenant**  
I am aware of thine accomplishments, and they are not few.  
Long ago, I struck an accord with a human chieftain.  
'Twas agreed, Humans would rule the lands lapped by the sun's rays, and rats, all that was below.  
But humans are liars all, schemers and cheats.  
Thou art from a different cloth cut. Do not disappoint me.

**\- Reach Rank 2 in Rat King covenant**  
Thy deeds are known to me. Still, there is ever more work to be done.  
Humans are creatures of greed. The time came they broke their word, and hunted us down.  
I had their word the underworld was ours to rule, untouched as it is, by the rays of the sun.  
The more humans coveted, the more blinded they became as to what truly mattered.  
And that is why I pity the fools called humans.  
My servant, human scent lingers upon thee yet.  
Rid thyself of it, if thou canst.

**\- Reach Rank 3 in Rat King covenant**  
My servant, well met indeed.  
'Twould seem some sunlight-poisoned creatures are worthy of great honour.  
Thou'st permitted me to dream. One day, rats and humans may yet live and die together, in peace.

**\- When attacked but not aggroed**  
What is thy purpose?  
(or)  
Enough of thy baseness.  
(or)  
I've had quite enough.

**\- When attacked and aggroed**  
I will destroy thee, filthy human!

**\- When killing the player**  
Disgusting creature…

**\- When re-encountered after aggroing**  
Thou art a fool to show thy face here!

**\- Unknown**  
Adieu sweet burrow.
