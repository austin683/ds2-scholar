##  Build Strategy

Important to keep your Equipment Load below 70% at all time to medium roll. Start with Drangleic set, they are early to obtain but a bit heavy for early game but you can mix with hunter's set to lessen the weight. Don't upgrade Drangleic's Set, not worth it. Faraam set obtain way later in game. Faraam Set truly shine when upgrade to +10 / lighter than Drangleic set and it's easy to upgrade if you have been saving up all the Titanites. King's Set is a good set for NG+ and against most bosses. Fully upgrade King's Set +5 is not as good as Faraam Set in terms of defense but check out King's Elemental defense, truly outstanding against all kind of elemental damage. Penal Handcuff is special if you want to quick shot bosses. Effect increase pyromancy good for Flame Swathe and Chaos Storm. Can 3-4 shots bosses instance KO.

Most of the time I wore Covetous Silver Serpent Ring to take more souls even against boss fight. Dispelling Ring also provide a very good elemental defense a +60 to magic/fire/lightning/dark.

Do not upgrade staves since they will only be used for support spells that aren't any more effective with a Sorcerer's Staff +10 than a Sorcerer's Staff
