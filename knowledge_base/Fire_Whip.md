**Fire Whip** is a [Pyromancy](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Fire Whip** , an ancient, primal pyromancy. Sweeps foes with a whip-like flame. Among the original pyromancies, its effective use demands agile footwork, making it a challenging spell for most. [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") are offensive fire spells that do not demand [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith") or [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") prerequisites and can be executed with a [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") or [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame"). The fire damage scales with [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"), yet there are no specific stat requirements for casting pyromancies. However, opponents resistant to fire damage remain unaffected by [Pyromancy Spells](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies").

### Fire Whip Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

    * Great spell in PVP when being approached, you can cast this spell to stun and burn your opponents to open them to other attacks. 
    * Since this spell has a large hitbox in front of the caster and leaves a hitbox for the full casting time, this spell is a great setup in PvE, especially for enemy crowds **approaching** the player on narrow-ish spaces, hitting most of them at once.
    * Has unexpectedly high stagger/poise damage and the hits pile quickly. Can stop some humanoid enemies dead in their tracks and be vulnerable to the rest of the spell.
    * However, this tends to stagger and push enemies back on most of the hits, making proper spacing essential to maximize damage.
