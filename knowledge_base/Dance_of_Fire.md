**Dance of Fire** is a Pyromancy in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Pyromancy, you must use a Flame or Special Weapons that can cast Pyromancy.

> Pyromancy created by the magus Eygil, loyal follower of the Old Iron King. Cast flame in a sweeping motion across a targeted area.  
> The fire seems to dance, and makes its victims dance with it.

### Acquired From

  * [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower"), in a room containing an ashen idol, accessed from a ladder. Coming from the first bonfire, descend the first few short ladders after the first encountered enemies and then a longer ladder to another floor with an idol and more enemies. The spell is in a small sub-room off to the right from the ladder base.

### Notes

  * Quite similar to Flame Swathe in that it is hard to hit, but it can deal a lot of damage.
  * It can be useful when the enemy is running around in circles in PvP, but it is only useful in PvE when large groups of enemies are aligned in front of you in a horizontal pattern. 
  * The projectile follows an unusual pattern, traveling in a horizontal arc in front of the caster. The direction depends on which hand is used for casting.
  * Despite its appearance, it does not deal Dark damage.
