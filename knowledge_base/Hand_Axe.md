**Hand Axe** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Hand Axe** is a quick and nimble axe that's easy to handle. Does decent physical damage, making it good for fast attacks. Ideal for characters who prefer agility in combat.

> A crude hand axe.  
>    
>  More of a tool than a weapon. Its short range necessitates close-range, and therefore perilous, combat. Does a respectable amount of damage, however, considering its relatively light weight. 

### How to get Hand Axe in Dark Souls 2

  * Starting weapon of the [Bandit](/Starting+Classes#Bandit "Dark Souls 2 Starting Classes#Bandit")
  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") for 700 souls.

### DS2 Hand Axe Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Though at first this weapon may seem puny and harmless, it can be a very viable backup weapon. With relatively high damage for its weight and how early on you can get it, it is also an alright early game choice.
