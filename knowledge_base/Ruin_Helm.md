_"Helm worn by the jailer's creation, the Ruin Sentinel.  
The sentinel has no form, its soul residing within the armor itself. Stare at it for long and it seems ready to spring to life, but surely, such is an illusion."_

### Location

  * Drops from Ruin Sentinels in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle).
  * Recommend farming this set on your 1st play through, because on NG+ and higher the ruin sentinels only spawn once, were on NG they spawn 15-10 times.
  * Very rare for sentinels to drop the armor (especially chest piece) so its best to wear jesters hat, prisoners rags and use rusted coins and the gold serpent ring.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Ruin Helm Set](/Royal+Swordsman+Set).
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite+Slab).
