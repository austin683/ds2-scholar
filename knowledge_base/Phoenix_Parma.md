**Phoenix Parma** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing. 

     _"A small shield decorated with a phoenix._

     _The sea of flame that swallowed the Iron Keep took this shield as well,  
but when it was retrieved it was mysteriously unscathed, save a degree of discoloration."_

### Acquired From:

  * [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"), area just before the Smelter Demon fog gate, in a chest in the lava. Need very high fire resistance to survive the acquisition.

### Phoenix Parma Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Infuse it with fire to raise fire damage reduction.
  * This shield was chosen to be in the game as one of the winners of the Shield Design Contest held by Bandai Namco and FromSoftware.
