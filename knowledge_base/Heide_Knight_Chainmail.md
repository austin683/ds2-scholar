_"Chainmail worn by Heide Knights"_

_"Whether Heide refers to a kingdom or was just a name for the land is not clear, for no records date back far enough to tell._

_All that is known is that the Way of Blue has its origins in Heide, and that Heide was later subsumed by the sea."_

### Location

  * [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") NG+ (only) or Bonfire Ascetic.  

    * Kill the knight that is in Lost Bastille. (Exile Holding Cell bonfire. Short walk to the knight from the bonfire, with only one enemy in the way.)

### Notes

  * Part of [Heide Knight Set](/Heide+Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight Set")
    * Despite its name, the [Heide Knight Iron Mask](/Heide+Knight+Iron+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight Iron Mask") does not belong to this set.
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores").
  * Assuming that you're attempting to get the entire set via bonfire ascetic, you will need more than one, as the armor does not drop all together, but only in pieces.
