**Charred Loyce Shield** is a [standard shield](/standard+shields "Dark Souls 2 standard shields") in Dark Souls 2. **DLC** or Downloadable Content shields cannot be obtained in the original version of the game, Dark Souls 2.

     _"Charred shield of the Knights of Loyce, burned black by flame._

     _These Knights of Loyce lacked all sense of self, and were driven only by the urge to expunge  
any who might disturb the flame, even former compatriots."_

### Acquired From

  * DLC [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King"): Dropped by [Charred Loyce Knights](/Charred+Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Knight") in the [Old Chaos](/Old+Chaos "Dark Souls 2 Old Chaos").

  
  

### Charred Loyce Shield Hints and Tips

  * Upgrades with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * The shield provides a health regeneration effect, equivalent to the [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King+helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King helm") (40 HP/min), and can be stacked with the [Ring of Restoration](/Ring+of+Restoration "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Restoration") to provide additional regeneration.
  * The shield's physical damage protection is lower than that of the [Charred Loyce Greatsword](/Charred+Loyce+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Greatsword"), meaning when combined, it would be more effective to use the sword with both hands, and keep the shield for its healing effect.
