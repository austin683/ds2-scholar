> To stand and glare at one another, steaming with ire and wrath, but without making a move.  
> Such is the nature of peace.

### Acquired From

  * DLC [Crown of the Sunken King](/Crown+of+the+Sunken+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Sunken King"). Located near the second bonfire, [Tower of Prayer (Shulva)](/Tower+of+Prayer+\(Shulva\) "Dark Souls 2 Tower of Prayer \(Shulva\)"). Before going on the platforms to the bonfire you see some statues with red eyes, destroy them with magic, etc. and you will see a pillar (the ones to move platforms) shoot it with a bow and a platform will rise. Alternatively, careful aiming allows you to hit the pillar without destroying any statue.  
  
Now enter the cave which is now accessible and you will come into a room with a strange tree, there are two corpses one of them holds it.  
  
Firebombs can reach the statues to destroy them. Stand at the edge of the cliff and aim a bit above the statues and the firebombs should reach. You need a direct hit so bring a few bombs.  
  
If you don't have miracles or requirements for them you can still get it. When looking at the statues, look down, and you will see the platform that you're trying to raise.  
Jump down on it and you can shoot arrows from there without destroying the statues beforehand.
  * Can also drop from the [Petrify Statue Clusters](/Poison+Statue+Cluster "Dark Souls 2 Poison Statue Cluster") in [Cave of the Dead](/Cave+of+the+Dead "Dark Souls 2 Cave of the Dead") (which can only be killed if you hit them just at the base).

### Notes

  * Catalyst: [Sacred Chime](/Chimes "Dark Souls 2 Chimes")
  * References and is reminiscent of the [Tranquil Walk of Peace](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Tranquil+Walk+of+Peace "Dark Souls 2 Tranquil Walk of Peace") miracle from _Dark Souls_.
  * When affected by the [debuff](/Buffs+&+Debuffs "Dark Souls 2 Buffs & Debuffs") of**** this hex, your weight changes visibly in your Equipment window. The increase is always 50% of your current equipment weight percentage. This means that if you have 20% equip load, you will have 30% while affected by Promised Walk of Peace.
  * At 32 attunement, this spell has 3 uses, and at 60 attunement, this spell has 4 uses.
