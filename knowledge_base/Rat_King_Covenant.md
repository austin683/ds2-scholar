**The Rat King Covenant** is dedicated to protecting the sanctity of the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") and [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros") locations. The scourge of human trespassers to these locations is handled by Rats and honorary Rats (players who've joined the covenant). This covenant is PvP based but with an emphasis on protecting "your turf." This is accomplished through a summoning mechanic specific to this covenant. The player character, while in the covenant needs to wear the ring [Crest of the Rat](/Crest+of+the+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Crest of the Rat") while in the Grave of Saints location (the bonfire near the boss fight, [Royal Rat Vanguard](/Royal+Rat+Vanguard "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Vanguard") room and [Rat King](/Rat+King "Dark Souls 2 Rat King") room do not count as viable summoning areas) or the Doors of Pharros location (specific summoning areas when covenant symbol pulsates). If another player enters the summoning zones in THEIR world, they have a chance to be automatically summoned to the world of a covenant member for battle. What this means is that the trespasser (non covenant player) must do battle in the home turf of the covenant member. This yields numerous potential bonuses to covenant members. The covenant member can summon enemy players while they are hollow.

**Covenant Leader** : [The Rat King](/Rat+King "Dark Souls 2 Rat King")  
**Where to Join** : [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints"), [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros")

## How to Join Rat King Covenant

After defeating the boss [Royal Rat Vanguard](/Royal+Rat+Vanguard "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Vanguard"), the [Rat King](/Rat+King "Dark Souls 2 Rat King") will be accessible directly after. Speaking to him (he looks like a normal rat on a pile of bones immediately after the fight) indicates that, although he hates humans, he has gained respect for you. Seemingly, murdering a large number of his followers is a good thing in his eyes. He can also be found at the end of the other dungeon in the Doors of Pharros area after defeating the boss there. You may also join the covenant just after killing the [Royal Rat Authority](/Royal+Rat+Authority "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Authority") inside of the [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros")

  
Firstly, covenant members benefit by all mobs (several hollows and numerous large rats) becoming allies at all times. A covenant member will NEVER be attacked by mobs while in the Grave of Saints. However, trespassers must face all mobs that aggro in addition to the covenant member. Mobs do still follow the respawn rules so covenant members can find themselves without backup if their buddies are killed too many times. Additionally, the Grave of Saints is littered with [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") faces which may be used to alter the environment. Once placed, a stone cannot be removed, however placing stones allows the covenant member to alter their turf and lay traps for invaders. Two bridges for instance open a smaller secondary area that can be used to loop around the two primary walkways that make up the Grave of Saints. A group of additional rats can be a trap to lure trespassers to in this room. Rat statues with urns can be activated by [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") as well on the upper walkway. They will pour acid on the floor which damages armor very quickly. The covenant member IS affected by this but they have the luxury of knowing which pools are active. Pools can be jumped over but this requires very precise timing. A ladder connecting the two walkways has a filthy looking waterfall when a Lockstone is used nearby. This does not appear to harm either party but can be used to hide behind and lure the trespasser into more rats unknowingly. If either party is using a torch it will be extinguished.   
  
A trespasser will be summoned as a "Gray Spirit" and will always spawn at the entrance of the Grave of Saints. This means that they will encounter the large group of rats and several hollows at the beginning of the level (until they stop spawning) and of course the Rat King covenant member if they feel like being mean. If a trespasser kills mobs they remain dead until the covenant member rests at a bonfire (there are two easily accessed in this area). Trespassers CAN use a [Black Separation Crystal](/Black+Separation+Crystal "Dark Souls 2 Black Separation Crystal") to separate themselves from the world. This is dependent on being given enough time to use this however as the covenant member is given a warning that a trespasser is being summoned well before they arrive. In other words, there is no reason that the covenant member can't be waiting for the trespasser if they choose. If the covenant member wins they will gain a [Rat Tail](/Rat+Tail "Dark Souls 2 Rat Tail") which can be offered to the Rat King to further one's devotion to the covenant. If the covenant member loses they must find their blood stain and suffer the normal penalties of dying. Recovering the stain is of course not an issue as nothing in this area will be hostile to the player.

  * There is also a 10-minute time limit to killing the summoned player, if it runs out, they will return to their own world.
  * In addition, there seems to be a three minute delay before another invader could be summoned. (This can be bypassed by quitting and re-launching the game, tested on PC 5/15/14. Simply exiting the invasion area and sitting at a bonfire does NOT work, the game must be restarted.)
  * If you are in the Rat Covenant and win you will receive: 1 [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone"), 1 [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth %26 Silky Stone") ([Patch 1.10](/Patch+1.10 "Dark Souls 2 Patch 1.10")) and 1 [Rat Tail](/Rat+Tail "Dark Souls 2 Rat Tail").
  * If the 'trespasser' manages to make it to the end of the area they are given 1 [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone"), as well as returning to their world in front of the bonfire at the end of the labyrinth.

### Rank

[Rat King](/Rat+King "Dark Souls 2 Rat King") covenant members can also summon and engage in PvP in the [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros") area. Enemies beyond the Gyrm's Respite bonfire will not attack the player, and similarly to the Grave of Saints, traps can be created by placing Pharros' Lockstones. Upon defeating a summoned gray phantom, the covenant member is awarded with a [Rat Tail](/Rat+Tail "Dark Souls 2 Rat Tail") and a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros'+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone"), along with souls from the opposing player.

    | 1 | 10 Rat Tails | 10 Small Smooth & Silky Stone |
    | 2 | 20 Rat Tails | 10 Smooth & Silky Stone |
    | 3 | 35 Rat Tails | Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring |
    

### Notes, Hints, and Tips

  * Rats can poison enemies with their attacks. Additionally the [Crest of the Rat](/Crest+of+the+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Crest of the Rat") ring will increase your poison effect. So if you use poison weapons you can inflict the status on your target very quickly. Remember anyway that grey phantoms can use their estus flasks when summoned here.
  * Unlock several traps with your [Pharros' Lockstones](/Pharros%27+Lockstones "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstones"), so your opponent will have to face more enemies, more traps, more difficulties. In Doors of Pharros, for example, many doors will increase the number of enemies in the map, giving you a great advantage when fighting.
  * Summoned opponents will always spawn at the beginning of the dungeon, so you can use that advantage to ambush them as well as you can.
  * If you hate to be summoned as Grey Phantom, you could play the game Offline while in this area.
  * Bonfire Ascetics can be used to upgrade the NPC mobs to the next NG+ level.
  * You have to go through water so it's recommended to use lightning and not to use fire. Also a shield with a high lightning defence can be a big help.
  * [Door of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros") is a large open area, while [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") is a more closed in area.
  * If you don't want to wait and fight other summoned players to get rat tails, you can always grind the 4 rats in the boss fight at [Door of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros") as they can drop [Rat Tails](/Rat+Tail "Dark Souls 2 Rat Tail"), [Pharros' Lockstones](/Pharros'+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone"), and [Old Radiant Lifegems](/Old+Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Old Radiant Lifegem").
