**Dark Weapon** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> "Felkin the Outcast applied his art to transform Magic Weapon into a hex.  
> Adds dark damage to the types of damage the weapon already inflicts.  
>   
> Those who choose the path of dark are admonished by all manner of sorcerer.  
> But that does not stop the curious from being drawn to this strangely alluring craft.  
>   
> Catalyst: staff"

### Acquired From

  * Purchased from [Felkin the Outcast ](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast")for 2700 souls

### Notes

  * Buffs weapon with dark damage. Duration scales with Intelligence (As it is cast with a staff): 57 sec. at 16 Int, and up to 99 sec. at 24 Int. Inferior to [Resonant Weapon](/Resonant+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Resonant Weapon"). Equivalent to [Crystal Magic Weapon](/Crystal+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Magic Weapon") and [Sunlight Blade](/Sunlight+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Blade") in effectiveness. 
  * Resonant weapon only deals slightly higher damage at the cost of less duration, higher requirements, and less spell use. 
  * DS2's buff formula differs from other Souls games, instead relying primarily on the targeted weapon's base damage to determine how much AR the spell buff will add. Matching the spell buff with a damage type present on a weapon will add a flat bonus to the total AR, depending on whatever the weapon is infused with and/or naturally inflicts said damage type. A small scaling bonus is also added unless the targeted weapon doesn't scale at all with any stats.
  * While this is arguably the best weapon buff for dark-infused weapons, it should be noted that a resonant weapon does slightly more damage (.05, a negligible amount but more nonetheless) and should not be overlooked for a hexer that focuses on chime-based spells.
