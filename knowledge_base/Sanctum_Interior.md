This bonfire is located in the second part of [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon's+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon's Sanctum"), after using the [Dragon Stone](/Dragon+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Stone") to raise the bridge.

Going down, you will have to fight [Black Drakeblood Knights](/Black+Drakeblood+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Black Drakeblood Knight"), after the second one, you will eventually have to go down a broken stairway that lead to a room with a collapse floor, where you can see the level below. Leave that room behind and take the first left. The bonfire is behind a illusory wall on the left, right in the middle of the corridor.

That corridor leads to another flight of stairs going down to a room with the third and fourth Knights of the area.
