**Lindelt** is a mentioned-only location in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). It is subject to strict laws and emigration is a common means of escaping the authoritarian rule; a number of the defectors have found their way to Drangleic in an attempt to start new lives, but some have since gone [Hollow](/Hollowing "Dark Souls 2 Hollowing") and become a threat to the living. The monastery of Lindelt is said to be the new home of [miracles](/Miracles "Dark Souls 2 Miracles") and is the origin of most [clerics](/Cleric "Dark Souls 2 Cleric").

### Lindelt Lore

Lindelt is founded upon stringent commandments. Its inhabitants often travel to distant lands for ascetic training, but more than a few of these trainees liberate themselves from Lindelt's teachings in the process. Most clerics receive the [Cleric's Sacred Chime](/Cleric's+Sacred+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Cleric's Sacred Chime") as their first sacred chime, while full-fledged clerics of Lindelt commonly use the [Protective Chime](/Protective+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Protective Chime"). The [Archdrake Chime](/Archdrake+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Chime") is used by members of the Archdrake sect of Lindelt. The Archdrake sect are the keepers of Lindelt's histories, including the only record of its foundation, a tome they have good reason to keep hidden away. Little is known about the Archdrake sect and its ancient rituals, and those who dare to indulge their curiosity have been known to simply vanish. It is said their well-honed miracles and unwavering faith in the face of death made them worthy rivals to Drangleic's forces in their day. Those who serve the Lindelt Monastery willfully adhere to strict commandments. The [Unveil](/Unveil "Dark Souls 2 Unveil") miracle was created to castigate those who ignore the righteous teachings. It is often the sinful who seek piety, spurred only by a selfish desire for salvation. In Lindelt, known for its clerics and their miracles, sorcery is believed to be a profane practice. But as with anything, such beliefs are part faith and part front, and the [Archdrake Staff](/Archdrake+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Staff") was born of that hypocrisy.

In the sacred land of Lindelt, the [Ring of Restoration](/Ring+of+Restoration "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Restoration") symbolized prosperity and longevity for the great House Osteria. Cleric Forsalle of Lindelt was a master of miracles who fought battles across the lands. His allies called him a holy knight, but his enemies feared him for his "demonic powers". Ivory Rhones, sage of Lindelt and students of the sage created special rings to protect one's [life](/Ring+of+Life+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Life Protection") and [soul](/Ring+of+Soul+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Soul Protection"). The [Soothing Sunlight](/Soothing+Sunlight "Dark Souls 2 Soothing Sunlight") and [Bountiful Sunlight](/Bountiful+Sunlight "Dark Souls 2 Bountiful Sunlight") miracles, once kept by the Lindelt Monastery, were stolen and never recovered. There is a story in Lindelt, passed down through generations, claiming a band of knights once felled a poisonous dragon which menaced an entire nation. These were the [Drakeblood Knights](/Black+Drakeblood+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Black Drakeblood Knight"), and to them fresh dragon blood was sacrosanct. They believed that by obtaining it, they could achieve a true understanding of life, transcending their own banal existence. In truth, the fools who woke the slumbering dragon earned not only its ire, but also the destruction of an entire country. The survivors buried their wrongdoings in the past, and in a show of terrible conceit, attempted to make amends by carrying on the knowledge of the wasted land. After his defeat of the Sunken King during his invasion of [Shulva, the Sanctum City](/Shulva+-+Sanctum+City "Dark Souls 2 Shulva - Sanctum City"), their leader Sir Yorgh pierced [Sinh, the sleeping dragon](/Sinh,+the+Slumbering+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon"), with his [spear](/Yorgh's+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Yorgh's Spear") to claim its blood. But Sinh immediately awoke, spewing a poisonous fog that blanketed the city in death, and Sir Yorgh disappeared into the Eternal Sanctum.
