_"Desert Sorceresses have enchanting looks, and they use them to catch people off guard._

_Oddly enough, even those who are perceptive enough to realize the ploy fall prey to their seductions with alarming regularity."_

### Location

  * Drops from [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress "Dark Souls 2 Desert Sorceress") in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak").

### Notes

  * Part of the [Desert Sorceress Set](/Desert+Sorceress+Set "Dark Souls 2 Desert Sorceress Set"). 
    * Ironically, this set is vulnerable to fire, despite Desert Sorceresses being users of pyromancy (or fire sorcery).
    * Considered to be a decent light armor, you can make various ridiculous builds, such as one who power stances a [Bluemoon Greatsword](/Bluemoon+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Bluemoon Greatsword") and a [Moonlight Greatsword](/Moonlight+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Moonlight Greatsword") without the worry of weight.
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades#Ore").
  * Moderate to high petrification resistance for clothing.
  * The top enhances the chest size for female characters, along with [Singer's Dress](/Singer%27s+Dress "Dark Souls 2 Singer%27s Dress").
  * The male variant has a different top and different boots; the skirt comes with an additional mini skirt. They share the same hood and gloves.
