**Coal Tar** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.

  
Black, many-tentacled monsters that, when a player approaches, will burst out from the black tar pools on the floor of Black Gulch. Upon breaching the surface, the Coal Tar can eat the player with a grab attack if they remain too close, or in one spot. 

###  Strategy tips

  * The pools these creatures spawn from are easily set alight with a well-placed [Pyromancy ](/Pyromancies "Pyromancy ")or [fire arrow](/Fire+Arrow "fire arrow") from afar. This technique will quickly burn the creatures to death without them leaving their hole at all.
  * If you'd like to face the _Coal Tar_ up close, it's best to approach a pool and quickly roll or backstep away. This will usually bait the monster's grab attack leaving it open for an easy punish.
  * A [fire infused weapon](/Upgrades "fire infused weapon") will help tremendously in dispatching these creatures, as attacks will also set their pools on fire.
