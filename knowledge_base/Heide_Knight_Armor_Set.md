_Whether Heide refers to a kingdom or was just a name for the land is not clear,for no records date back far enough to tell._   
_All that is know that the Way of Blue has it's origins in Heide,and that Heide was later consumed by the sea._   
  
Drops from Heide's knights in the Forest of Fallen Giants, The lost bastille and Shrine of winter. Armor pieces appear to drop random.   
Since the Heide's knights dont respawn, it might be difficult to collect all armor pieces because you'll have to burn another bonfire ascetic (or proceed to the next NG) every time if they don't drop the wanted armor piece.
