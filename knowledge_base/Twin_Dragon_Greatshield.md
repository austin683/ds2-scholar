**Twin Dragon Greatshield** is a [ Greatshield](/GreatShields "Dark Souls 2 GreatShields") in Dark Souls 2. **Greatshields** can be used not only to block an enemy but allows player to do **shield bash**(Great shields replaced parry ability with heavy shield bash).

     _"A wooden greatshield featuring twin dragons.  
Quite light for this size of shield._

     _One requires strength to handle a greatshield, but they are very stable.  
In battle, one fights using shield bash instead of parrying."_

### Acquired From:

  * [Maughlin the Armourer ](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") for 2000 souls.

### Twin Dragon Greatshield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with [Titanite Shards, Large Titanite Shards, Titanite Chunks, Titanite Slab](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores").
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * At its cheap cost it is rather easy to grind up the necessary souls to purchase this shield and it is a perfect choice for a tank until they can gain a hold of the tower shield which is easily found in [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue").
  * This greatshield reappears in the sequel  _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Twin Dragon Greatshield](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Twin+Dragon+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Twin Dragon Greatshield").
