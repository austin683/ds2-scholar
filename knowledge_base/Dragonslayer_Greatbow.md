### Dark Souls 2 Dragonslayer Greatbow Acquired From

  * Trade the [Old King Soul](/Old+King+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Old King Soul") to [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex").
  * Upgraded with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5.

### Dragonslayer Greatbow Hints & Tips in Dark Souls 2

to upgrade

  * Must be re-anchored between shots, regardless of remaining stamina, which means this bow is much slower than the [Alonne Greatbow](/Alonne+Greatbow "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Greatbow") \- both on the initial shot as well as every subsequent shot.
  * The animation causes the shooter to take a short step back after every shot. Holding forward while in aimed mode between shots will counter this effect with a short step forward, but one should be careful near ledges one way or the other.
  * 121 Stamina is needed to fire a shot with this and have enough stamina left to immediately act (Roll, swing a sword, etc)

This can be achieved at 15 Endurance with the Second Dragon Ring.

In Dark Souls 2, if you try to attack with something that uses more stamina than you currently have, you'll attack more slowly and do less damage. That thankfully isn't the case with this bow. If you're at full stamina, you do full damage and attack at full speed.
