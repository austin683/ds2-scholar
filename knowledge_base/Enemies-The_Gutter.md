## The Gutter Enemies

  

  

###  [Abandoned Hollow](/Abandoned+Hollow) (Captive Undead)

  

Sword Hollow. The most lowly of the hollows, slow moving and dressed only in minimal rags. Most are bare-handed, though some wield torches. Often feign death or otherwise hide, e.g., by hanging out of sight from a cliff face. Really only a problem in groups or if you forget about them, and the catch you unawares.   
  
_The Undead hunts during the reign of the Iron King took place in this forest, and the cells in which the Undead were held still stand there to this day. However, the march of time has eroded any difference between the captors and the captives_

  

  

###  [Poison Brumer](/Poison+Brumer) (Poison Horn Beetle)

  

Are these beetles the source of the poison that fills the earth below the mines, or are they merely the only insects that can survive in these conditions, either way, they suit the Queen`s tastes perfectly. 

  

  

###  [Rotten Vermin](/Rotten+Vermin)

  

"A queen of the species of giant corrosive ants native to Jugo. Only one exists in Drangleic; its presence in The Gutter seems to suggest that it began its life in the laboratory of Lord Aldia's mansion and eventually outlived its usefullness"   
  
This massive insect queen doesn't do much but stand inside the cave, with no attacks to speak of. Her corrosive gas can heal poison, but at the cost of depleting your equipment durability. As such, it's probably better that you just kill her. Guarded by hostile poison ticks.   
  
The insect is probably related to the creation of [Poison Brumer](/Poison+Brumer) throughout [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak), [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana) and the large prototype in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep), they're to release corrosive or poison gas, while Lord Aldia deployed them in Amana to fend off intruders, Queen Mytha modified the brumers by placing the brumers into poisonous area in order to feed her dying wish for beauty. 

  

  

###  [Undead Laborer](/Undead+Laborer)

  

_Torch Hollow. As if a lifetime of toil wasn't enough, these workers continue their duties even in death. And this time, their job is to kill you. Probably as in life, these under-appreciated, down-trodden souls simply aren't equipped for the task -- they face you unarmed_

  

  

###  [Rupturing Hollow](/Rupturing+Hollow) (Undead Citizen)

  

Mummified hollows which, when they detect a player, charge them at high speed. You can detect them early by the rattling of their chains. Often occur in groups. Their speed and aggression is intimidating and can force the player into a defensive, pressed battle. All Undead Citizens have a devastating "belly flop attack" -- see [Rupturing Hollow page](/Rupturing+Hollow) for details and variants. 

  

  

###  [Melinda the Butcher](/Melinda+the+Butcher)

  

_"Wherever the lost and wicked gather, those who prey upon them_   
_are never far away. So it has always been, and so it is in The Gutter, a_   
_settlement of filth and pestilence where the endless struggle to survive_   
_has driven its darker souls to seek sustenance through the consumption of_   
_living flesh. Beware, lest the cannibalistic legacy claim yet another victim..."_

  

  

###  [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan)

  

A former sorcerer surrounded by conflicting rumors and great controversy, Navlaan gained infamy when he was supposedly executed along with his entire village for practicing Dark magic, but the truth is far more complicated. At first glance Navlaan appears to suffer from dissociative identity disorder and displays two opposite personalities. The reality, however, is not so easily explained; perhaps it would be better to draw your conclusions after meeting him yourself. 

  

  

###  [Swollen Mongrel](/Swollen+Mongrel) (Hunting Dog)

  

Grotesque, dog-like creatures that will slash and bite the player when they get close enough. They are not, however, very fast, so ranged attacks work well.   
  
_A mutated canine born from the experiments conducted by Lord Aldia. Hunting Dogs are not a naturally-occurring species and are therefore only found in areas to which they were introduced by the Dragon Acolytes. A number of them were dumped into The Gutter over the course of Lord Aldia's research and continue to prowl its depths in search of anything that might serve as a meal_
