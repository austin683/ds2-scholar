**Executioner Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
_"Black Helmet/Armor/Gauntlets/Leggings worn by the executioner of the Undead Purgatory. The spikes are designed to evoke fear._   
_The executioner mercilessly put down countless Undead, but how could he know that it was never his own will, but that of the chariot horse?"_

###  Set Location

  * Sold by [Titchy Gren](/Gren) (25,6k) once [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle) has been reached.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite.](/Twinkling+Titanite)
  * Worn by the character riding [Executioner's Chariot](/Executioners+Chariot "Executioner's Chariot").
  * Helm offers the highest bleed resistance and second highest dark defense (almost equal to that of [Shadow](/Shadow+Set) mask and [Velstadt's](/Velstadt's+Set) helm).
  * Chestpiece offers second highest bleed resistance (almost equal to that of [Havel's set](/Havel's+set) chestpiece).
