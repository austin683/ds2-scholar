### How to get Retainer Staff in Dark Souls 2

  * DLC: [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King").
  * After killing [Avaa, the King's Pet](/Aava,+the+King's+Pet "Dark Souls 2 Aava, the King's Pet") and talking to the [Queen](/Alsanna%2C+Silent+Oracle "Dark Souls 2 Alsanna%2C Silent Oracle") to stop the Snowstorm, the Retainer's Staff can be found behind the now melted ice blocks in a narrow path close to the fountain on the way to the second bonfire.
  * Dropped by [Retainer Sorcerer](/Retainer+Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Retainer Sorcerer")

### DS2 Retainer Staff Hints and Tips

  * High base damage (300 max), but it offers no scaling, making it only suitable for extremely low INT sorcerers/hexers.
  * However, it is completely outclassed by the [Witchtree Branch](/Witchtree+Branch "Dark Souls 2 Witchtree Branch"). The Witchtree Branch is obtainable earlier (Black Gulch for the key as compared to post-Drangleic for the Ivory King DLC key), is lighter, offers nearly twice the casting speed, and even at the absolute minimum stats of 18 INT + 4 FTH, the Witchtree Branch ends up with 302/297 magic/dark damage, a negligible loss for the aforementioned bonuses, while also being strictly better with both infusions (dark included). At 6 FTH or higher, the Witchtree Branch is always better than the Retainer Staff even with no infusion.
