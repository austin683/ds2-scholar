### Dark Souls 2 Giant Warrior Club Hints and Tips

  * The Giant Warrior Club is extremely powerful and its two handed strong attack can devastate enemies.. If both hits of the whirling attack hit the enemy, it will throw them to the ground.
  * Also the second heaviest weapon with the second highest Str requirement in game, only to be outclassed by [Smelter Hammer](/Smelter+Hammer "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Hammer")
  * If it is upgraded to +10, it gets an A parameter bonus for strength.
  * This weapon requires 90 STR to power stance.
  * Has less horizontal range that the Smelter Hammer as well as many other Great Hammers. Two-handed R2 is a spinning maneuver similar to the second two handed R1.
  * Infusing this weapon with magic is highly recommended for STR/INT builds, as it will outdamage every other weapon ingame, only outclassed by two powerstanced giant warrior clubs.
  * This weapon respawns when a bonfire ascetic is burned at The Place Unbeknownst bonfire.
