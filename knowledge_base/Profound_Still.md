### Profound Still Notes

  * Unleashes a wave of dark energy around the caster, any enemies caught within the cast are afflicted with a [debuff](/Buffs+&+Debuffs "Dark Souls 2 Buffs & Debuffs"), becoming unable to cast spells for 30 seconds.
  * Casting time is a factor when using this hex; planning and forethought are strongly recommended when using this hex.
  * Unlike its counterpart [Vow of Silence](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Vow+of+Silence "Dark Souls 2 Vow of Silence") in _Dark Souls_ , this one does not lock the user who cast this spell, The user can take this as an advantage and cast the spell while the others can't
  * Capable of leaving an aura onto invisible enemies in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"), making them slightly clearer with the marking. Not very helpful, but better than nothing.
  * It completely disables all attacks of [Aldia Warlocks](/Aldia+Warlock "Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock") since they do not have any means of melee attacks other than AOE magic explosion.
  * Completely disables all spells from [Sanctum Priestess](/Sanctum+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Priestess") in [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon%27s+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Sanctum")
  * Does not work on [Banedigger](/Banedigger "Dark Souls 2 Banedigger"), [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") and [Elana, Squalid Queen](/Elana%2C+Squalid+Queen "Dark Souls 2 Elana%2C Squalid Queen"). -Tested, she still summoned her [Lifedrain Patch](/Lifedrain+Patch "Dark Souls 2 Lifedrain Patch") and shot her beam.
  * Other players wearing the [Sanctum Priestess Tiara](/Sanctum+Priestess+Tiara "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Priestess Tiara") will not be affected by this spell.
