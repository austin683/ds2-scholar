**Bosses** in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki") are powerful enemies that add challenging experiences to the game.**Bosses** can be encountered throughout the different areas of the game. While some must be fought to progress through the story, most are optional. Each boss features a unique set of moves, gear, and various weaknesses and resistances to different damage types and styles of play. Successfully defeating a boss grants the player larger amounts of Souls than traditional enemies in their respective areas, and many offer rare and/or unique armaments, [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor"), [Magic](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic"), and other [Items](/Items "Dark Souls 2 Items"). This page contains a list of all the **Bosses** encountered in the game.

List of all **32 Bosses** available in **Dark Souls 2** , and the bosses encountered in the additional DLC content. Defeating them grants you access to further areas, gives you special items such as [Keys](/Keys "Dark Souls 2 Keys"), and drops [Boss Souls](/Boss+Souls "Dark Souls 2 Boss Souls") that can be used to acquire [Boss Soul Weapons](/Boss+Soul+Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Boss Soul Weapons").

**Notes:**

  * If you have a [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory") of 1,000,000 souls (NG), you can go directly to the [Shrine of Winter](/Shrine+of+Winter "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Winter"), which in turn allows you to skip large portions of the game (This doesn't work on SoTFS PS4 Version). Since this detail technically makes over half of the bosses skippable with ridiculous grinding, it is not taken into account when considering a boss "optional" or not.
  * There are also other bosses that can be skipped regardless, depending on which path you choose. See [Optional Bosses](/Optional+Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Optional Bosses") for **more** details.
  * If bosses are defeated with a last hit, but they deal a hit on you causing your death at the same time, that boss could potentially not be considered defeated and can respawn.
  * If the aforementioned scenario occurs in co-op where the host and the boss die within seconds of each other, you**_WILL NOT_** receive your "duty fulfilled" reward ([Token of Fidelity](/Token+of+Fidelity "Dark Souls 2 Token of Fidelity"), [Sunlight Medal](/Sunlight+Medal "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Medal"), etc). However, you ** _will_** get the souls for defeating the boss if it dies before the game loads you back to your world.

####  [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant")

Area boss of the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). [Mild-Mannered Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate") can be summoned right outside the fog door, if you have met the conditions for his sign to appear.

Accessed after going down a lift and at the end of a narrow corridor. He will detach his arm and use it as a weapon when he is at about 50% hp or below.

**Souls Awarded:** 10,000  
**Weakness:** Fire, Lightning  
**Optional** : No

**Notes:**

  * Pate is actually a decent summon for this fight. He doesn't do too much damage, but he can keep the heat off you if you're a caster. It's best to stay far from The Last Giant's feet; the shockwave hits the area next to the foot as well. If you don't want to summon Pate, it is easy to dodge his arms and feet because they are slow and easy to telegraph. Simply bait him to use his arms and run between his legs then attack his feet.
  * This boss can be skipped up until later in the game when you need the [Soldier's Key](/Soldiers+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldiers Key") in order to access [Memory of Jeigh](/Memory+of+Jeigh "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Jeigh"). This can be done by going through [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame") ([Old Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider")) then proceeding through [No Man's Wharf](/No-man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man%27s Wharf") to get to [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille").

####  [The Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer")

Second boss of the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). Accessed by going up onto a high bridge that leads to the Bastille.  
Can also be fought upon returning to [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon")'s location, and there are two of them at [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle")'s throne room, behind [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager")(NG+).  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 17,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning, Strike  
**Optional:** Yes   
  
**Notes:**

  * This boss is only optional at the start of the game if you fight the [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry") ([No Man's Wharf](/No-man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man%27s Wharf")) and [the Ruin Sentinels](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") instead. However, defeating this boss in either of the two encounters in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") is necessary in order to access [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Orro").
  * You can obtain all five [Souls of a Giant](/Soul+of+a+Giant "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Giant") with [Bonfire Ascetics](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") used in the [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch") to respawn the two giants down in the cave. With the soul gained from the [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon") as well, this boss is technically entirely optional.
  * If you're going to use poison, the earliest you can get it is to buy it from Gavlan in No Mans Wharf.

####  [Executioner's Chariot](/Executioners+Chariot "Dark Souls 2 Executioners Chariot")

This boss is encountered in the [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse") across a dilapidated wooden bridge and behind a dark spirit NPC.  
Pull a lever down the corridor to knock the charioteer off and kill him, then battle the horses. Watch out, as their kicks are unblockable.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 19,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning, Poison  
**Optional:** Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * Your main tactic for this fight is going to be running. Avoid the skeletons and run for the alcoves to dodge as the Chariot passes. Have a shield with 100% melee protection, as while you're in the alcoves, the skeletons will still attack you. All you have to do is wait for the chariot to take them out, giving you some breathing room. It is best to have a lot of stamina for the first phase of this fight because you'll constantly be running and blocking. Take out the two necromancers in the area so the skeletons can die. Once the rider is down, the second phase and the horses begin attacking you. Their attacks don't hit too hard, but they move quickly and unpredictably, so having a caster who can fire from afar can help a lot, as well as other summons to keep the horse busy.
  * After the fight, you can go into an area with another bonfire. The area in question is a dead end, but it allows you to join the Brotherhood of Blood if you have a Token of Spite with you.
  * If finding the necromancers is an issue, throw an alluring skull in the middle of the corridor whilst the Executioner's Chariot is still charging. It will kill them and the skeletons with it. The first necromancer is located three alcoves to the left as you enter the area and the second is located six alcoves to the right, just before the gate lever.

####  [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Knight")

Boss in [King's Passage](/King%27s+Passage "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Passage"). He can summon NPC's and **invaders (Mirror Squires)** during the fight with his mirror shield. Benhart of Jugo can be summoned right outside the Fog Door.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 25,500  
**Weakness:** Dark, Strike, Poison/Toxic  
**Resistance** : Fire, Lightning  
Optional: No  
  
**Notes:**

  * This is one fight where Benhart is actually a bane rather than a boon. Since he doesn't block at all, the Knight will just be toying around with him. He does keep the aggro well, but for the buff the boss receives for a summon and how quickly he is killed off, he is definitely just going to be more of a hassle than a help. If you do want him as a summon, summon another player as well to counteract him.
  * The Knight's shield will deflect any and all attacks, spells andmiraclesincluded, even when it is just by its side. Hitting the shield will cause you recoil from a melee attack and a spell will shoot off into the distance. The only time you can attack the shield is in the second phase when he summons a gray phantom, though its best if you don't attack the shield as the player coming out of the shield most often cannot react quickly enough and can be easily killed if focused down.
  * As with all armored bosses, he's more vulnerable to blunt, crushing weapons like maces or clubs.

####  [The Skeleton Lords](/The+Skeleton+Lords "Dark Souls 2 The Skeleton Lords")

Area boss of the [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse"), behind the waterfall. Three large skeletons wielding a scythe, spear, and pyromancy flame.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 15,000  
**Weakness:** Alluring Skulls, Yearn & Strike, Strike, Fire/Lightning  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * As soon as one of the larger skeletons is destroyed, they let out a blast to signify when the skeletons will arrive. Its definitely recommended having some summons for this fight, at least one to help you deal with the smaller skeletons. Blunt weapons are best to deal with the smaller skeletons. While not very fast, they do more damage than strike or slash weapons. It's best to have a fast weapon to deal with The Skeleton Lords themselves, however.
  * For an easier way to defeat this boss, kill only one of the Lords at a time, while continuously moving around the arena. The smaller skeletons only spawn in groups after defeating one of the Lords. So, kill a Lord, then kill the skeletons that they spawn, and repeat the process for the other two. A good first move is to sprint from the fog gate to behind the right-side Lord and backstab him as soon as he lands and can receive damage. The Skeleton Lord who uses mainly pyromancy (it wields a Bone Staff while the other two use a scythe and spear) spawns Pinwheels and should be killed last. When the pinwheels spawn, attack them before they have a chance to stand up and you can take out a couple of them before the rest start attacking. Spamming Heavenly Thunder as they start appearing can clinch the fight for you before they have a chance to start spinning around the arena.

####  [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry")

Area boss of [No-man's Wharf](/No-man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man%27s Wharf"). Accessed by ringing a bell atop the Wharf that docks a ship. Lucatiel of Mirrah can be summoned earlier in No-Man's Wharf.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 14,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning, Poison  
**Optional** : Yes*  
  
**Notes:**

  * This boss can be optional if you decide to fight [The Pursuer](/The+Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 The Pursuer") and[the Ruin Sentinels](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel")  
instead.
  * You can hit the bell from across the map if you use Iron Arrows.
  * Lucatiel is decent for this fight if you plan to simply attack this boss at a range. You shouldn't go toe to toe with the boss if you're not very agile, as it can attack quite fast stun you. If you do plan to attack with melee, goad it to attack with one side. The other side will not attack you while the other is in its combo, so you can get a quick few hits in. Lucatiel's summon can be found near a large grate inside a 3-story house; pull the lever near the grate to activate a shortcut.

####  [Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner")

Area boss of [Sinner's Rise](/Sinner%27s+Rise "Dark Souls 2 Sinner%27s Rise"). Accessed by going through a long, flooded hallway leading to the building which has 2 stairwells on the side. Can be locked on to if lights on the sides of the outside of the arena are lit. Guards a Primal Bonfire.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 45,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning  
**Resistance** : Fire  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * As soon as the boss starts, the first thing she will do is shut out the lights. You should either turn up your brightness settings or, before the fight, light some oil places on fire that are located up the two stairs that are visible on the way to the fight (this is only possible using the Bastille Key found beyond the Belfry Gargoyles, and thus they must be killed before battling the Lost Sinner). Spells are not recommended as a light source, as they will burn out eventually and torches prevent you from using your left-hand weapon.
  * The boss itself is pretty fast and agile, reminiscent of Artorias from the first game's DLC, though not quite as hard-hitting or aggressive. The best tactic is for at least a single summon to help, whether it be for aggro bait or simply to take pot shots to whittle down her health.
  * With the lights off your lock-on range is greatly reduced making it difficult to use spells. With the lights turned back on by burning the oil in the two adjacent rooms before the boss fight, your lock-on range is returned to normal making spells easier to land.
  * For melee players, stay close and watch her attacks. The thrust is easy to dodge, but the slashes are faster. However, strafing will sometimes work as you can get behind to hit her.

####  [Belfry Gargoyles](/Belfry+Gargoyle "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Gargoyle")

Area bosses of [Belfry Luna](/Belfry+Luna "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Luna"). Total of five of them to fight. Very similar to the gargoyles in Dark Souls.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 25,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * AOE spells and sweeping weapons are more effective against the Gargoyles since they will likely be next to each other. If focusing on one target, it's best to have a summon to distract the others.
  * When a Gargoyle's health is reduced by half, they will generally start breathing fire. Rarely, they will use an attack similar to Blinding Bolt and is telegraphed by one of them holding their bident up and starting to glow, like the Looking Glass Knight.
  * The Gargoyles are extremely weak to Lightning damage, and Gold Pine Resin, Sunlight Blade, or lightning-based weapons will carve through them in very short order.

####  [Ruin Sentinels](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel")

Area bosses of [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"). Accessed by the end of a hallway of a series of cell rooms. Pilgrim Bellclaire can be summoned in one of the cells leading up to the Fog Door.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 33,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning, Magic, Strike  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
  
**Notes:**

  * The first Ruin Sentinel is directly to your left upon entering the boss room. These bosses are agile and can jump back onto the platforms if knocked down, landing with a sweeping attack that's difficult to see coming. You will only have to fight one of them at first. When the first one is down, the other two will jump down and slowly head towards you.
  * A summon is good for this area; Crystalsorceriesseem to be the most damaging, taking off sometimes a third of one's health with one shot. There is an NPC summon in one of the cells right before the boss fight who uses Crystal sorceries; however, she has poor physical defense, so use the Red Eye Ring or be prepared for her to die.
  * Skip: If you have a lockstone in your inventory and the antique key, you can make your way to the lockstone room where you find the bone staff via holding cell bonfire. Once the lockstone is placed it will expose 2 illusory walls, one of which will have a lift that takes you to the beginning of Sinner's Rise, completely bypassing the boss.

####  [Royal Rat Vanguard](/Royal+Rat+Vanguard "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Vanguard")

Area boss of [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints"). Accessed by going through the mist after the second bonfire. Looks like a normal rat but has a giant mohawk on it's back. There are MANY rats in this room, so watch that you don't get poisoned or petrified.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 11,000  
**Weakness:** Fire (Flame Swathe and Lingering Flame can kill large numbers of rats at the same time while still dealing heavy damage to the boss himself)  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * There is no summoning available in the Grave of Saints. You must face the rat horde alone.
  * The boss battle technically doesn't start until you've killed ten rats. The rats do not infinitely spawn, but you'll be wanting to kill about one, finding the best exit to the other side of the room and repeat. You should be able to survive if you do this conservatively. Don't panic if the rats start to clog and exit. You can usually just clear a few out and some will aggro you, giving you enough room to retreat. The small stones on the ground can be used as barriers to heal, as the rats can't seem to get past them easily. Best to keep Poison Moss or any other item that cures poison/toxic. Your main goal is to look for the rat who has a mohawk. It's a bit tricky, but you'll know it when you see it. Your goal is to kill that particular one, as it is the actual "boss". It's best to kill him as quick as possible while still remembering the steps from above. These things don't hit hard, but can combo damage and quickly cause poison and petrification (Vanguard only).
  * Since the regular rats can be evaded relatively easily, and the Vanguard has little health, a crossbow can be very effective. Do your best to avoid the host while looking for clear shots of the boss. It shouldn't take more than 30 regular bolts from a heavy crossbow, even if your dexterity is low. Wide, sweeping weapons are not recommended, as the small statues will block your swings and momentarily stun you.

####  [Royal Rat Authority](/Royal+Rat+Authority "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Authority")

Area boss of the [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros"). A giant rat with a moveset similar to Sif from Dark Souls.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 14,000  
**Weakness:** Fire  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * There is no summoning available in the Doors of Pharros. You must face the monster rat alone.
  * The four smaller rats in the boss room must be killed immediately, as they can and will afflict you with poison. Fire is powerful; if you put out a Lingering Flame and quickly attack one of the rats, you can make them walk into a powerful trap.
  * For melee players, dodging its frontal attacks and running underneath it will let you hit the back legs. Be wary of tanking the boss, as its attacks drain lots of stamina and inflict poison. If the boss starts to vomit, run, as it breaks all equipment if you stay underneath. It is best to have a shield that both blocks 100% physical damage as has high stability.The boss is slow and its attacks are easy to spot. It has large sweeping attacks like Sif but it also can bleed you making this fight very short. You'll want to stay as close to its legs as possible no matter what build you're using. 
  * Sorcerers will find this fight easier as they can simply put out an Affinity, Homing Souls mass etc. to kill the small rats quickly while doing a bit of damage to the boss. However, you still will need the shield so unless a Sorcerer is agile and well-timed, they'll find this boss to be a pain.

####  [Scorpioness Najka](/Scorpioness+Najka "Dark Souls 2 Scorpioness Najka")

Area boss of the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"), accessed by the third bonfire. Take the path to the right of the large basilisk. Manscorpion Tark can be summoned outside the Fog Door if you talk to him with the Ring of Whispers first and exhaust his dialogue.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 23,000  
**Weakness:** Fire, Dark  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * Don't be fooled as you walk in. She's half-buried in the sand and will fire sorceries until you approach her.
  * Manscorpion Tark won't deal much damage to her but is an excellent tank for casters. Unfortunately, he doesn't hold her aggro very well, so ranged weapon fighters should expect her to suddenly charge them from time to time, and melee fighters should be ready for her to occasionally hit you instead of Tark.
  * The boss itself is fairly easy albeit difficult to predict. Her melee attacks are easy to dodge and leave her wide open, save for her tail whip which does a lot of damage, comes and goes fast, and will knock you down(her tails can be cut to make the fight easier). Fortunately, you'll have time after pretty much any of her attacks to recover stamina and chug an Estus. If she manages to hit you with her double sting, hope that your allies can hold her aggro and be prepared to start chugging Estus until the Toxic status effect goes away.
  * Halfway through the fight, she'll burrow underground and attempt to murder you from below; you can hide out on the block of stone in the middle of the chamber, and she won't be able to reach you. Watching where the ground spits out dust clouds and running away from her is also acceptable. Just don't get cornered while running, as this move deals massive damage. Your movement speed will also be slowed a few seconds before she emerges, making the attack extremely difficult to dodge.
  * Magic shields are decent for long range, though her sorceries will more than likely stagger you as she fires multiples at a time. If possible, hide behind a tree when you see her beginning to cast, as they'll soak the spells for you.

####  [The Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja")

Area boss of [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). Accessed by going through the whole map. Guards a Primal Bonfire. Ashen Knight Boyd can be summoned behind a pillar at the back of the bottom floor. Facing directly away from the fog gate, run to the back wall and turn left.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 42,000  
**Weakness:** Fire  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * Unlike the other Primal Bosses, you must pick up Freja's soul. There is not a bonfire particularly near the boss fight without many enemies, so be sure to pick it up when you kill Freja, or else you will find only disappointment at the Shrine Of Winter.
  * Once you enter the boss fight, you'll notice a few minion spiders around. Kill them and you'll have a few minutes to attack the boss before these enemies respawn again. To counteract this, its best to have at least one summon during the fight, preferably one who takes care of the spiders or aggros the boss giving you time to take care of the little ones.
  * Spellcasters should maintain a safe distance, as it makes her attacks more predictable and reduces the chances of being suddenly stomped on. It's better to alternate between Freja's two heads, as opposed to focusing exclusively on one.
  * The best opportunity to damage her comes during and after her wide-sweeping laser attack. Trigger the laser by maintaining a fair distance, and Freja will generally fire it. When the laser is coming, the boss will turn to your left and a beam will emerge. Simply run to the other head and wail on it a few times. This is more easily accomplished with at least two people, although that makes it more difficult to predict where Freja will fire her laser.
  * After the boss fight, there are two enemies between Freja's chamber and the Primal Bonfire. One enemy, Vengarl's Body, is particularly strong. He is easily dispatched if you poison him and simply walk back into the library and through the archway, which acts as a "safe zone".

####  [Mytha, the Baneful Queen](/Mytha%2C+the+Baneful+Queen "Dark Souls 2 Mytha%2C the Baneful Queen")

Area boss of the [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak"), directly in the middle of Harvest Valley. Jester Thomas can be summoned next to the staircase prior to the Fog Door, but only after the poison is drained. Thomas is one of the more useful NPC summons in the game, outputting a large amount of damage through pyromancy and is recommended if the boss is giving you trouble.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 16,500  
**Weakness:** Fire  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * Burning the windmill near the second bonfire in Earthen Peak will drain the poison from Mytha's chamber as well as the poison in the room before the fog gate. This also allows Jester Thomas to be summoned for the boss fight.
  * A secret bonfire directly above her fog gate will save time between attempts.
  * Stay in the center of the fight for the most part as you can still be poisoned by the pools on the outskirts, and lure her away from them as the boss will heal if she stays inside one. Jester Thomas has a tendency to stand in the pool of poison, no matter how small, and get poisoned; however, he can still survive long enough to output an incredible amount of fire damage. Mytha attacks primarily with her spears, but she can also cast sorceries from her decapitated head. When she throws her head, it will deal magic damage in a wide area after landing. Mytha will immediately rush to retrieve it, leaving her vulnerable assuming the attack was dodged.

####  [The Rotten](/The+Rotten "Dark Souls 2 The Rotten")

Area boss of the [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch"), below the [Gutter](/Gutter "Dark Souls 2 Gutter"). Lucatiel of Mirrah can be summoned next to the bonfire outside the Fog Door. Lone Hunter Schmidt can be summoned to the left of the Fog Door, in the open, though this is not recommended as he deals little damage and has little health. A large mass of bodies swinging a giant cleaver, its attacks hit hard and it has a deadly grab attack. Its arms can be destroyed with some persistence, and the left arm drops a Pharros' Lockstone, but they will regenerate after a period of time. It will sometimes vomit acid that degrades equipment, oil the player (causing them to explode if they attempt to light a torch or step into the fire pits) and has two ranged attacks: a dark-damage area-of-effect blast and a frontal dark-damage cone. Watch out for the fire pits, as they drain health very quickly.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 47,000  
**Weakness:** Thrust  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * Its attacks are devastating to both health and stamina. Its slash attacks will stagger a blocking player and significantly drain their stamina and will deal heavy damage to unprotected players. However, is attacks only deal physical damage, so a 100% physical shield can be useful in emergencies. Blocking is still not recommended, however, as The Rotten tends to attack multiple times in quick succession and will usually break a players guard and deal heavy damage in a three-hit combo. Even if the damage isn't dealt, this commonly knocks players into one of the fire pits. If it pauses slightly while raising the ax above its head, roll to the side as its preparing a sliding charge that has deceptively long range: oftentimes, rolling backward will not be sufficient. When it slowly pulls its left hand back, it is preparing a grab-this has little range and is easily dodged by rolling backward, but it will instantly kill anybody it successfully grabs unless they have extremely high health and physical defense.
  * At approximately 50% HP, The Rotten will gain two new attacks. When it begins to hunch its shoulders and close its fists, immediately dodge and roll backward as it is preparing a wide AOE dark-damage blast, but be careful to not roll into one of the fire pits. When it raises its cleaver and begins to gather energy it in, it's preparing a wide, long-range frontal cone that deals dark damage. If you are already a considerable distance away from The Rotten, keep moving back to make certain that the attack does not damage you. However, if you're already close to The Rotten, roll to the right at the last moment to dodge most of the attack.
  * The Rotten deals extremely high damage, has high health and resistances, and attacks surprisingly quickly, but does not move terribly fast. Ranged players and spellcasters can easily kite the boss, but must be careful to not move into the fire pits.

####  [Old Dragonslayer](/Old+Dragonslayer "Dark Souls 2 Old Dragonslayer")

Boss behind the fog gate across a large drawbridge dropped by pulling a nearby lever, at [Heide's Tower Of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+Of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower Of Flame"). Masterless Glencour can be summoned from the Dragonrider arena. His moveset is almost identical to Ornstein's from the original Dark Souls.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 20,000  
**Weakness:** Fire, Magic, Strafing  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * The boss attacks using a combination of dark magic, stabbing attacks with his spear, and slashes. Hiding behind the pillars and attempting to heal will cause the Old Dragonslayer to charge you, breaking the pillar and likely dealing hefty damage (if not finishing you off outright). One summon is useful for this fight; one individual can hold the boss' attention relatively easily and protect their partner while they heal. The boss himself is not remarkably durable and can be easily stunned, but is fond of disengaging from close combat using a retreating swipe while jumping backward.
  * The Old Dragonslayer will occasionally squat and glow with dark energy, and the player should immediately roll away upon observing this as he will jump into the air and slam down, sending out a powerful shockwave. Be wary: although the Old Dragonslayer is vulnerable after doing this, the aftershocks from the attack continue into the first few moments of his vulnerable state, which can lead to some unexpected damage if the player moves in too quickly. The Old Dragonslayer will also fire dark energy blasts at the player; these can home in, but are still easily dodged by rolling towards them.
  * When the boss leans forward and grabs his spear with both hands, he is preparing a very fast charge. If this connects, the boss will impale you and deal heavy damage. Rolling towards the boss (at close range) or to the side (at long range) easily avoids this, but the boss takes reduced damage briefly after the attack if it did not connect. Melee players are advised to strafe to his left, as this will prevent many of his thrusting attacks from connecting.

####  [Covetous Demon](/Covetous+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Demon")

Area boss of the [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley"). A large slug-like monster, this boss is quite easy. He flops and rolls around the arena and also uses some sweeping attacks. He can also eat the player, which will unequip all of their armor, weapons, and **rings**. If you are worried about this attack, store all unequipped gear in your item box and it will be much easier to find your weapons in the case they get unequipped.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 13,000  
**Weakness:** Magic, Thrust, Fire  
**Resistance:** Poison  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * The boss is fond of rolling towards the player, but almost always rolls again if the first attack did not connect. Thus, it is best to wait several seconds before retaliating. The boss will also vomit corrosive acid onto the player, degrading their equipment, and can use a variety of short, fast swipes at players in front of him. When the Covetous Demon pauses and licks his lips, he is preparing to swallow the player-if he succeeds, then they will suffer heavy damage and all of their armor, weapons, and rings will suffer a durability penalty and be unequipped. However, be aware that the room you battle him in is small, and getting trapped against a wall while the Demon is in the middle of a roll or a belly flop will likely result in a quick death.
  * Above the arena are pots with the undead in them. Break them with a powerful projectile (anything equal or greater in power to a Soul/Iron Arrow) and the corpses will drop. The Covetous Demon will completely ignore you and focus on eating the corpses. While eating, he takes significantly less damage, but will completely ignore any aggressive taken towards him. This can also be an opportunity to heal or re-equip gear if it has been removed.

####  [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon")

The first boss of the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"). It guards a rather useful bonfire that significantly reduces travel time between deaths in the second half of the Iron Keep, so defeating should be a priority. Lucatiel of Mirrah can be summoned for this battle, but she is often defeated very quickly. Still, she is an excellent tank for casters. Using the Redeye Ring can increase her chances of surviving, but will require the caster to get uncomfortably close to the boss.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 32,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning, Poison  
**Resistance:** Fire  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * The Smelter Demon is incredibly dangerous, and ending the fight quickly significantly increases the player's chances of success. The Smelter Demon does not deal any fire damage in the first phase of the fight, but can still deal significant physical damage and can perform a leaping stab that may be followed by an AOE: there is no way to determine if it will use the AOE or not, so it is safest to simply back away after the leaping stab. It is also fond of performing a two-slash attack to either side before following up with a forward slice to the ground as well as a very fast forward stab.
  * After taking a small amount of damage, the room will darken and the Smelter Demon will squat and roar. From this point on, remaining in close proximity to the boss will deal continuous fire damage, and during the transition, the boss briefly enjoys reduced damage from all sources.
  * At approximately 70% health (the exact percentage varies, although the trigger is also time-based if the player takes too long), the Smelter Demon will stab itself with its sword and coat it in fire, also gaining increased damage protection during this stage. All attacks now deal additional fire damage, and the forward slice now sends out a jet of fire from the blade. The AOE following the leaping stab also an increased radius and deals additional damage.
  * Fire resistance gear of some sort is almost completely necessary, as even ranged players and casters will be taking continuous fire damage. Flash Sweat is a good choice for casters, while the Alonne Knight armor set can be useful for melee players. Fire resistance rings and consumables are also adequate, as are any other buffs. The Gyrm Greatshield, in particular, is helpful, as it offers 100% physical and fire resistance and thus offers immunity to all of the Smelter Demon's attacks except the continuous AOE damage (assuming the player has the stats to equip it). A Ring of Restoration, as well as several Lifegems, can mitigate the constant AOE damage as well, although the Ring of Restoration will easily break and Lifegems can quickly disappear given the rate at which they would need to be consumed.

####  [Old Iron King](/Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Old Iron King")

The second boss of [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"); there is a nearby bonfire called Eygil's Idol, which is hidden at the top of a ladder in the room with flaming minotaur heads and spikes before the fog gate. Guards a Primal Bonfire.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 48,000  
**Weakness:** Magic ([Soul Geyser](/Soul+Geyser "Dark Souls 2 Soul Geyser") only), Lightning  
**Resistance:** Fire, Dark  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * The Old Iron King stands waist-deep in lava the entire fight, keeping his main body out of reach of most melee weapons: attempting to attack the boss' main body with anything shorter than a spear or long thrusting sword risks a plunge into the lava at his waist. However, the boss can be hit with melee weapons on his left horn whenever he lowers his head for breath attacks, and on the hands and arms whenever his attacks leave them available (such as the laser attack). The boss can be hit by ranged weapons and spells at all times, except when he submerges.
  * The boss has no grab attack but instead relies on two physical attacks: a sweep to either side or slam onto the ground with his fists. The boss will often move from a sweep into a slam, but will sometimes sweep back and forth once on either side before attacking in this manner. After a slam, his hands remain on the platform for several seconds, offering the best opportunity to attack. However, be aware that if any of his attacks connect, the player will suffer heavy damage and be knocked down, likely costing them the opportunity to attack.
  * The boss can also breathe fire in two different ways: if he lowers his head, he will breathe a swathe of fire, generally from his right-to-left, that will cover the entire platform and can be avoided by moving between the flames. If he remains upright, the fire will spread in a smaller cone and can be avoided by moving backward. The Old Iron King can also, infrequently, let out a shockwave that deals damage and knocks the player down. If the Old Iron King raises both his fists and they begin to glow red, he is preparing a massive slam that will send out multiple pillars of fire-this is best avoided by moving back or hiding on the ledge near the exit to the room, to the far right of the entrance. He can also pull his arm back and let out a thin, continuous jet of lava that can move through walls, negating the advantage of hiding near the exit. The boss can also submerge unexpectedly, releasing a wave of lava when he goes under and when he resurfaces. He generally resurfaces on the opposite side of the platform that he submerged, but occasionally rises back up without moving. He will also reposition himself if the player maintains a certain distance. When the boss submerges to reposition, you can move anywhere in the area to cause him to re-emerge in a spot advantageous to you.
  * Great caution must be exercised in moving around the platform: there is a small hole directly to the right of where the player enters that can be easily rolled into if its existence is forgotten and, since all of the Old Iron King's attacks knock the player back, the boss can also easily kill the player by throwing them off the edge of the platform or into the hole. It is best to not be locked on to the Iron King when moving, for optimal awareness of the pitfalls.

####  [Guardian Dragon](/Guardian+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Guardian Dragon")

Boss of [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep"). While "Guardian Dragon"is in fact, fact a Wyvern, this is still an appropriate name as wyverns are defined as a type of dragon.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 38,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning, Dark, Magic  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * The boss has extremely low health and is incredibly vulnerable to lightning. Combined with the fact that the boss takes several seconds to begin attacking, the player can theoretically kill the boss before they even have a chance to attack if they've coated their weapon, readied their spells, or otherwise prepared for the boss before entering the chamber.
  * However, if the boss is not killed before they rise for the first time, then great caution must be exercised. The boss can breath fire onto the ground, causing it to splash outward and deal heavy damage in two pulses to players that are caught in the blast. The wyvern can also latch onto the walls of the aviary and breathe fire downward, either in a constant blast or as a single large fireball.
  * The boss will generally land after attacking once in the air, though they will generally rise back up after a few seconds if the player does not move to engage them swiftly. The boss is fond of spending a great deal of time in the air: not only are they out of range of most bows, but the circumstances are too chaotic to allow for spells to be properly cast.
  * Even on the ground, the boss is not defenseless. They can breathe fire in a sweeping motion from left to right, snap with their beak, or stamp with their talons. In addition, the boss will attempt to slam players directly behind them with their tail, breathe fire between their legs, or bite backwards. For best results, the player should stay as close to the wyvern's legs as possible; this will often bait the boss into using their stamp attacking, which is easily avoided and leaves a generous opening for the player to take advantage of.

####  [Demon of Song](/Demon+of+Song "Dark Souls 2 Demon of Song")

Area boss of the [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana"). A giant frog-like creature with a withered face and arms in its mouth. It is immune to damage when its face is covered. Felicia the Brave can be summoned in a hut before Rhoy's Resting Place, though it's difficult to bring her all the way to the boss if the enemies are not defeated beforehand owing to her tendency to fall into the deep water when chasing enemies.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 26,000  
**Weakness:** Magic, Lightning  
**Resistance:** Fire  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * The boss is motionless and does not react to attacks for the first few seconds of battle, giving players a chance to get some early damage in or finish preparations. The boss's skin is made of a tough, leathery armor that can be pulled down using its inner arms to form a protective coating that blocks all damage and causes the boss to resemble, visually, a young frog that still possesses their tadpole tail.
  * The boss is immune to all damage when their face is covered, but can still move around. When protected, the Demon of Song attacks by sweeping with its small armored limbs or by dashing towards the player; the boss will always steady its legs and hunch over before performing the latter, so the dash can be avoided easily.
  * After a period of time, the boss will open its protective coating and reveal the hideous face and arms within. During this phase, the boss will attack with its arms by slamming them on the ground, sweeping from side-to-side, or by attempting the grab the player and smash them against the floor of their lair. The boss will pull its arms back at an odd angle before attempting to grab, and players should roll backwards to avoid this.
  * The Demon of Song can also spit water at the player during this phase, either as a series of three large gushes or as a continuous stream. It can also perform a large body slam, rising up on its hind legs before slamming down with its arms outstretched. This is indicated by the camera panning upward and the boss's silhouette being emphasized by the light above its lair; the attack is best avoided by rolling or sprinting backwards and to the side, as simply rolling backwards will often not be enough to avoid the long reach of the boss' arms. During both phases, it will also attempt to attack players behind it with its tail.
  * Owing to its aquatic environment, the Demon of Song is permanently wet and is thus incredibly weak to lightning damage when its face is open, and is similarly resistant to fire damage.

####  [Velstadt, The Royal Aegis](/Velstadt%2C+The+Royal+Aegis "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt%2C The Royal Aegis")

First boss in [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"). He is a large knight wielding a giant bell hammer. Grave Warden Agdayne can be summoned for the fight, to the left of the boss's fog gate, near a pillar.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 50,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning  
**Resistance:** Dark  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * The battle against Velstadt, The Royal Aegis, is split into two phases. During the first phase, the boss will attack players with his bell-hammer; if he grabs his hammer with both hands and leans back, he is preparing a massive overhead slam that will knock players down and deal heavy damage. This attack should be avoided by rolling to either side, even if the player has a shield-the attack will likely stagger any blocking player, regardless of the stability of their shield owing to the strikes incredible power. The Royal Aegis will generally follow up this attack with a sweep to the right, so the player should be prepared to dodged twice.
  * If the boss leaps backwards and leans on his weapon-hand, he is about to charge forward at rapid speed and thrust with his bell-hammer; this can be dodged by rolling to either side. The boss can also swing backwards to attack players behind him, followed by a one-handed overhead smash.
  * Velstadt can also sweep to either side, and will generally do so twice, followed by a thrust forward with his bell-hammer. As these attacks do not knock the player down, he can easily strike the player three, which will generally kill any player not at full health or in possession of high physical defense. The boss can also perform a leftward sweep as he jumps back, allowing him to disengage while simultaneously dealing damage in a cone in front of him. All of these attacks should be avoided by rolling towards or away the boss; rolling to either side will generally cause the player to roll into the final portion of the swing, even if they roll away from the direction Velstadt is attacking in.
  * At approximately 50% health (although this can trigger as early as 75% health, depending on the player), Velstadt will crouch and begin ringing his bell-hammer, gathering dark energy around him. During and after this process, he gains additional damage reduction and deals significantly increase damage with all his attacks. Though none of them do additional dark damage, they deal significantly increase physical damage, and multiple hits (or a single attack from the overhead smash) will stagger any blocking player or kill any undefended one. They should be avoided as before.
  * The boss can crouch after the transition to the second phase and begin ringing his bell-hammer; after a few seconds, a large number of massive dark projectiles will be fired from his bell in a cone in front of him, dealing extremely high dark damage to any players struck and likely killing them in one blow. This can be avoided in two ways; either by getting behind him as the attack charges (which will give the opportunity to deal damage to the boss as the attack is fired), or by retreating to a fair distance away and attempting to dodged between the projectiles. Assuming the player is far enough away from the boss, the distance between the projectiles is generous enough to allow for them to be avoided in this manner.
  * Any items, consumables, or spells which reduce dark damage will be extremely helpful. While rare, a 70%+ dark protection shield significantly simplifies the second phase, allowing the player to simply block the projectiles with little consequence. Perhaps ironically, given Velstadt's connection with Raime, the Rebel's Greatshield is perfectly suited for this purpose.

####  [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick")

Second boss in [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"). He is non-hostile and will only walk around aimlessly dragging his sword. He will aggro after taking a few hits and a fog gate will close off the room. He is slow and predictable but VERY powerful, and can easily one-shot even well-equipped players. Obtaining Giant Souls (not Soul of the Last Giant) will weaken his defenses, with a maximum of 5 Giant Souls bringing him down to normal boss HP.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 90,000  
**Weakness:** Bleed Weapons, Giant Souls  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * There is no summoning available. You must face Vendrick alone.
  * Make sure you have at least 4 Giant Souls to do any decent damage to him. Use a fast weapon, as Ultra Greatswords and the like may not give you a chance to get out of the way in time. Strafe him on his non-weapon side and you should be able to avoid all his attacks, as his swings only hit the side he is holding his weapon.

####  [Darklurker](/Darklurker "Dark Souls 2 Darklurker")

Secret and optional boss of [Dark Chasm of Old](/Dark+Chasm+of+Old "Dark Souls 2 Dark Chasm of Old") (accessed by joining the [Pilgrims of Dark](/Pilgrims+of+Dark "Dark Souls 2 Pilgrims of Dark") Covenant and lighting all 3 fires in the 3 Dark Old Zones). He can duplicate himself when HP is at about 50% or less.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 35,000  
**Weakness:** Fire, Lightning  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * There is no summoning available in the Dark Chasm of Old. You must face the Darklurker alone. 
  * He is majorly weak to pyromancy and lightning, so it is recommended that you have a maxed pyro flame and several pyro spells equipped. Using lightning and fire buffs on your weapon also works.
  * The Darklurker has very well telegraphed attacks. Be sure to memorize them and know how to defend against each type of attack, as this will make it easier to fight two of them once the first splits.

####  [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider")

First Boss of [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame"). Accessed by the mist located on a circle platform and guarded by an Old Knight wielding an ultra greatsword. Masterless Glencour can be summoned right outside the Fog Door.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 12,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning, Strafing  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * This boss is required for chatting with Licia of Lindelt. After exhausting her dialogue, she moves to Majula to open the way to Huntsman's Copse.
  * With enough arrows, you can damage him from the bridge where you pull the first lever. When his health is almost gone he will raise his shield and block all incoming projectiles. After this, when you enter the fog gate he will only have a tiny sliver of health.
  * His attacks are quick but insanely easy to telegraph. He usually only does a single attack and rarely will attack anything behind. Keep your shield up for the majority of the fight and strafe around his attacks which are easy to dodge. Having a shield with 100% melee damage reduction is recommended.
  * He's also very easy to parry, which can be done indefinitely through the whole fight, making it trivial if you can get the timing down.

####  [Twin Dragonriders](/Dragonrider%28Second+Encounter%29 "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider%28Second Encounter%29")

Bosses of [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"). Two of them: one uses a bow from a platform and can be drawn from his perch with ranged attacks, the other uses the same moveset as the Dragonrider from Heide's Tower.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 26,000  
**Weakness:** Fire (Flame Swathe takes out huge chunks of their health regardless of NG cycle), Lightning  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * A summon is very useful here. Be sure to try and take out the ranged Dragonrider first, as it has about 2000 less health than the melee Dragonrider. If the ranged Dragonrider falls down from his pedestal and you are near him, he will attack with melee, so its best to keep your distance at least until the first is taken care of.
  * If you don't have ranged attacks, use the red Dragonrider to knock the other off his perch by baiting him to hit the column he is shooting from, then he'll fall to your level, becoming vulnerable to melee damage. He won't switch his bow until he's at 10% health but you should kill him before he does that anyway as he is weaker as stated above.

####  [Prowling Magus and Congregation](/Prowling+Magus+and+Congregation "Dark Souls 2 Prowling Magus and Congregation")

Perhaps the weakest boss in the game, located in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). Can easily be defeated with a wide-swinging weapon or AoE spell, (I suggest Dark Fog). Take out the Magus and the two undead clerics first, the rest of the Congregation will be child's play. Be sure to go back and summon Bernhart of Jugo first if you want to complete his questline.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 7,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * It's best to summon Benhart of Jugo for this fight as he can be a great distraction as well as decent damage dealer. This boss is the easiest way to complete Benhart's questline at the cost of some bonfire ascetics. You can find his summon from the first bonfire to the right inside of a tent behind some boxes.
  * As soon as you're in, head straight for the priests in white or the Magus himself. Ignore the minions on the floor. The white mages will heal during the fight and throw lightning at you, so they might be on the top of your first to kill list.

####  [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord")

Boss of the [Memory of Jeigh](/Memory+of+Jeigh "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Jeigh") after examining a tree in the Forest of Fallen Giants. His moveset is the same as The Last Giant when he has removed his own arm. He has a ranged attack where his sword creates a forward-moving shockwave.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 75,000  
**Weakness: Fire, Magic**

  * Dark - Great Resonant Soul hits for 1050 damage at 65 int/faith (at the cost of souls), while Dark Hail also deal 1050 damage if all orbs hit the boss
  * Magic - 7 Casts of Soul Geyser will kill him, at nearly 1500 damage per cast (tested at level 600+ with 99 INT and Magic Staff of Wisdom +5, in NG200+)
  * Lightning - 12 Casts of Great Lightning Spear will kill him (Tested at level 600+ with 99 FTH and Lightning Dragon Chime +5 in NG200+)
  * Fire - More specifically Pyromancy. While not as good as the aforementioned weaknesses, Pyromancies such as Great Fireball and Great Chaos Fireball deal around 650-700 damage with a +10 Pyromancy Flame at only 25 Int/25 Faith (tested in NG+ through NG+7)

**Optional** : No

  
**Notes:**

  * Soul Farming Target (killing him in NG+7 gives approximately 400,000 souls; with [Tseldora Set](/Tseldora+Set "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Set") and Covetous Silver Servpent Ring, over 500,000 with all gear.)
  * You can summon Benhart of Jugo or Captain Drummond for this fight, but your reward will be less. The Boss will be a bit tougher, but the NPC will make it a considerably faster fight. Even though the soul count is less when summoning an NPC, it may be faster to gain more souls using them in the long run, as each fight will be much shorter. To summon NPC's repeatedly, you must leave the area and return. Memory of Vammar is a good loop to accompany this memory for collecting useful Items, allowing the NPC to be summonable upon your return to Memory of Jeigh.
  * When respawning the Giant Lord, **ALL** the memories will reset as well; this means that all items respawn, and going through each memory will net you a few Souls of a Hero and Great Souls of a Hero, as well as Soul Vessels and Smooth and Silky Stones. So don't just continually respawn the Giant Lord without going to each memory and collecting all items. Preferably do this with casting rather than melee because it takes too long to kill giants with melee.

####  [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon")

Boss in [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine"), found at the very end of the map. The player can talk with him to obtain the Ashen Mist Heart and optionally fight him.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 120,000  
**Weakness:** Magic, Lightning  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * He mostly uses flame attacks against you, by breathing flame straight in front of him; or he does a flame breath from his right to left. He will also fly into the air to do a very large AoE attack that in most cases kill you if you don't run away. Flame resistance isn't much help against this attack as it hits more than once. Best way to avoid this is to have a light or no armor and run to the furthest edge of the arena, but be prepared to run past him or you won't have enough time. You can easily see when he does this by looking carefully at his wings during the whole fight, so if they start to flap you should start running immediately. After the attack run back in fast. The boss will also move slightly towards the place you ran to, so you usually can only use the same spot twice, but sometimes only once so look carefully at the distance.
  * There's also a small chance to get really unlucky if he decides to do the AoE attack right after you run back in, so you might bite the dust because of it. Being too close to his face might trigger his physical attacks, so the best fighting spot for casters is to be slightly right of his face with a little distance. Same goes for melee, you just tickle his feet during his frontal flame attacks. Vengarl can be summoned (who is quite useless), as well as Melinda the Butcher, but this fight is best to do alone since the boss will use other attack patterns outside of his flame attacks if there's people running around him.
  * Be patient; this boss has high HP and can take a while to bring down.

####  [Throne Watcher and Throne Defender](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher and Throne Defender")

Bosses of the [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Throne of Want"), accessed after obtaining the King's Ring.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 68,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * The easiest way to do this fight is to have as many summons as possible. Preferably two who can tank their attacks and one who can damage them from afar. Benhart and Vengarl can be summoned for this fight so Clerics with lightning and Sorcerers can use them well. They usually alternate between targets randomly.
  * Your best bet is to attack The Watcher first since he is the fastest of the two. You should keep their health bars relatively close to one another. Once one is taken down, just kill the other as quickly as possible. Should one be revived during the fight, focus on the one with more health so they are back to the same health level.
  * The fight is straight forward. Just make sure to keep an eye on both at all times, as Throne Watcher does have both a projectile attack and an AOE burst, though both are rarely used.  

  * Both will begin to enchant their weapons once below 50% HP.
  * It is recommended to defeat the Giant Lord after you fight them, otherwise the fight with Nashandra will begin immediately afterwards.

####  [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra")

Boss of the [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Throne of Want"), appears only if you have the [Giant's Kinship](/Giant%27s+Kinship "Dark Souls 2 Giant%27s Kinship") and the King's Ring. Final Boss.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 90,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning, Fire, Magic  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * The boss itself is fairly easy, albeit extremely hard-hitting. Attacks are well telegraphed so you won't have much trouble there.There are two basic attacks she does: the first is a simple scythe slash, which does a lot of damage but is easy to avoid by just being a bit close. The other attack she does is an AoE dark attack. She'll channel the dark and sprout up fountains around her at the beginning of the fight and every so often. These fountains curse you and drain your health by a considerable amount if you're anywhere near them. The Cursebite Ring is recommended, as well as armor with high Curse resistance. It's best to have at least one summon for this fight. Benhart can be summoned, though if you're a pure melee character I wouldn't recommend this. Best to have a caster nearby simply shooting lightning to get her health down in chunks. As a summon, I had a regular Lightning Spear and 35 faith and I was doing about 120 - **200** damage per strike without the 'Sun Bro' ring equipped.
  * The Lifedrain Patches created by her CAN be destroyed by hitting them a few times.

####  [Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin](/Aldia%2C+Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%2C Scholar of the First Sin")

Boss of the [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Throne of Want"), appears only if you have met him in all three locations and defeated both Vendrick and Nashandra. True Final Boss.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 0  
**Weakness** : Lightning   
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * This boss mostly uses fires based projectiles and teleports, everytime he reappears he leaves AoE explosion, The Gyrm Greatshield can block most of his attacks effortlessly.
  * During flame mode in 1st phase, he has at least 50% damage reduction. During 2nd phase, there is at least 75% damage reduction. That aura deals fire damage.

###  DLC Bosses

###  [Crown of the Sunken King](/Crown+of+the+Sunken+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Sunken King")

### [Elana, Squalid Queen](/Elana%2C+Squalid+Queen "Dark Souls 2 Elana%2C Squalid Queen")

  

First boss of the [Dragon's Rest](/Dragon%27s+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Rest"), encountered after the maze-like pit area filled with [Black Drakeblood Knights](/Black+Drakeblood+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Black Drakeblood Knight").  
A halberd-wielding woman with a ghastly appearance, who mainly uses Dark Magic and Dark Pyromancy to annihilate her opponents. She also has the ability to summon minions to assist her, making the battle even more hectic.  
She has to be defeated to gain access to the Sanctum Nadir Bonfire; and ultimately [Sinh, The Slumbering Dragon](/Sinh%2C+the+Slumbering+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Sinh%2C the Slumbering Dragon").  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 72,000  
**Weakness:** Magic, Strike  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * She's highly resistant to Lightning. Fire and Magic attacks seem to be the most effective. She will summon 3 variations of enemies, all different in difficulty, once the battle gets going. She can summon Velstadt (or a enemy wearing his armor), skeletons, and rarely will summon pigs like those in Majula. All these enemies inflict poison damage. It appears that the summoned enemies are weak to lightning damage [__please confirm__].
  * There are two NPC summons available for this fight: [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo"), and Steelheart Ellie; however, neither is recommended. Ellie dual-wields Caestus, and dies rather quickly; Benhart similarly stays to close to Elana and both tend to die because of her AoE Dark Blast. If you want to summon, summon other players instead.
  * The Dark [Transgressor's Leather Shield](/Transgressor%27s+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Transgressor%27s Leather Shield") has 100% Dark damage reduction that can help if you are a ranged attacker, but always be prepared to face off against her minions.

### [Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon](/Sinh%2C+the+Slumbering+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Sinh%2C the Slumbering Dragon")

  

Second boss of the [Dragon's Rest](/Dragon%27s+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Rest"), found directly after the Sanctum Nadir Bonfire. A slumbering pale dragon with a giant spear pierced in his chest. You see it awakening before the first bonfire of Shulva and when you approach the Dragon Sanctum (it flies over the bridge and breathes fire on you and the enemies there). It's the final Boss of the Sunken King DLC.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 96,000  
**Weakness:** Lightning  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * His fire inflicts toxic build-up. You can cut the tail if you attack it several times with some melee weapon with high damage (has a high chance you can break your weapon trying to do this). It's tail does not drop anything. A very aggressive boss with a fleshed out set of attacks, including many aerial attacks that can one-shot unwary players.
  * The [Rebel's Greatshield](/Rebel%27s+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Rebel%27s Greatshield") or [Gyrm Greatshield](/Gyrm+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Greatshield") are excellent for this fight in regards to negating any fire damage. The Rebel's shield can also greatly reduce Toxic build-up. Two summons are available right by the Sanctum Nadir bonfire: one is a faith caster and the other is a Black Dragon phantom like those encountered in Dragon's Shrine. The Black Dragon summon is much more convenient, as he can heal and dish out decent damage. However, it seems that the more summons you have (and the farther apart they are), the more likely that Sinh will stick to aerial attacks.

### [Afflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, and](/Graverobber%2C+Varg%2C+and+Cerah "Dark Souls 2 Graverobber%2C Varg%2C and Cerah") [Cerah the Old Explorer](/Graverobber%2C+Varg%2C+and+Cerah "Dark Souls 2 Graverobber%2C Varg%2C and Cerah")

Optional Bosses of the [Cave of the Dead](/Cave+of+the+Dead "Dark Souls 2 Cave of the Dead"), accessed after the Priestess' Rest bonfire. Three NPC-like enemies that gank you: the first is a dual swordsman, the second is a Havel tank, and the third is an archer.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 60,000  
**Weakness:** Parrying, Backstabbing, Guard Breaking (preferably using a dagger-like Mundane Manikin Knife +10 to do the most backstab and riposte damage)  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * This boss battle is meant to be fought in co-op; it's still possible solo, but it requires kiting. There are two NPC summons available right after you fall off the small ledge after the bonfire, Rapacious Andrei and Ruined Alfis. However, keeping them at full health will be difficult since the area leading up to the boss fight is filled with petrification statues and poison variants of the Sunken Knights. Player summons are recommended if possible, as well as group healing spells. These enemies can also backstab you and they are not afraid to use that to their advantage. The Ironclad Armor or the [Jester's Robes](/Jester%27s+Robes "Dark Souls 2 Jester%27s Robes") will prevent you from getting surprised from behind.
  * For the most part, the archer Cerah will stay back and fire great arrows at you while the Graverobber and Varg gank you. Use wide swinging weapons so you can hit more than one at a time, and do your best to keep them far apart so they don't gang up on you if you're solo. In co-op, have it so that you and your summons are individually fighting only one boss at a time.
  * If you summoned any phantoms to the fight, there are two easy ways to complete it. The first is poison/toxic. All of them are able to get poisoned and toxic, just have your phantom distract two of them (preferably the swordsman and Havel) and just throw toxic and poison mists at the last one. Somewhere between 3 - 6 casts is needed, depending on how much they dodge them. The archer will die extremely fast using this strategy (I used it on him with bonfire intensity 56 and he only needed to get toxic and poisoned once, to get him far enough down to finish with a couple of hits from a decent weapon). After the first is dead, just move on to one of the others and repeat the strategy.
  * The second way is parrying. This might be harder than the first, depending of how good you are at parrying, but basic strategy is the same as with the poison strategy. Have your phantom distract two and just parry the last one. After getting parried the first time, they usually enter an extremely predictable attack pattern and makes it very easy to parry them again. (When I used this strategy, the archer kept getting up and attacked with the same attack immediately almost every single time). Again, once the first goes down, just rinse and repeat.
  * For solo tactic, kite the three bosses to lower platform, once they're lined up, focus on Graverobber and Cerah, keep casting Great Resonant Soul until they die out, once there's only Varg left, you're mostly safe.

###  [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King")

###  [Smelter Demon](/%28Blue%29+Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 %28Blue%29 Smelter Demon")

A Smelter Demon that burns of blue; he is much more powerful than the one in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"). Resides in Iron Passage, which is this DLC's co-op area, meaning you probably shouldn't go through this alone.  
  
Souls Awarded:75,000  
**Weakness:** Poison, Toxic, Fire  
Resistance**:** Magic  
  
**Notes:**

  * He has the same moveset as the Smelter Demon in the Iron Keep, but with some additions. He will sometimes prolong an attack or change it altogether. The Tick-Over AOE seems to be stronger. His sword, when buffed by his blue flame, is twice as big as the one wielded by the other Smelter Demon, and deals magic damage instead of fire damage. The helm is different as well, and looks more like a taurus.
  * If you plan to get to this boss solo, it's best to run through the entire area rather than fight the enemies leading up to him. The most annoying of which will be the Astrologist casters, who will spam [Promised Walk of Peace](/Promised+Walk+of+Peace "Dark Souls 2 Promised Walk of Peace") and [Profound Still](/Profound+Still "Dark Souls 2 Profound Still"). If you can, spam Profound Still yourself to stop them, because they will also use Great Heal on the enemies you try to kill and make your run that much more difficult.
  * During 3rd phase, his attacks deals only magic damage.

###  [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight")

Final and only mandatory boss of the Crown of the Old Iron King DLC. Found at the bottom of [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower"), near the Throne Floor bonfire. Carhillion of the Fold can be summoned for this fight, as well as Steelheart Ellie.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 84,000  
**Weakness:** None (as far as all research goes)  
**Resistance :** Lightning, Fire, Dark, Magic, Slash, Thrust  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * Arguably one of the toughest, if not _the_ toughest, boss in the entire game since he likes to delay some attacks to catch players off guard. The Fume Knight is not too difficult at first, as he mostly uses his greatsword to attack, only occasionally using his ultra greatsword in large sweeping attacks. However, once you get him down to about 60% health, he buffs his ultra greatsword with Dark Fire damage. Not even the Gyrm Greatshield, with its 100% fire reduction, can stop all of the damage this buff inflicts. Note: with specific tactic listed on the page, player can avoid this buff.
  * Similar to Sir Alonne, Raime has very high defence towards non-physical damage. Therefore, if possible, the player should switch to melee.
  * This fight is made more difficult because (following the trend of this DLC), enemies and bosses have prolonged attack animations as opposed to the well telegraphed and timed attacks of the main game bosses. Be wary: this boss will heavily punish you if you dodge a half-second too quickly or too late. Always be cautious about your dodges because the longer and slower attacks will likely catch you.
  * The NPC summons are not recommended if you're in NG+ and above, as they die quickly if the Fume Knight aggros them. Wear the Red Eye Ring to maintain the Knight's aggro so that the NPC's can wail on the Knight. However, the Fume Knight seems to be resistant to magic, as Carhillion's strongest attacks (like Crystal Soul Spear) barely hit for 200 dmg in NG+3.
  * This boss is actually Raime, the left hand of King Vendrick. It appears that if you wear Velstadt's helmet, Raime will immediately buff his sword, as if in anger against his brother-in-arms.

###  [Sir Alonne](/Sir+Alonne "Dark Souls 2 Sir Alonne")

Boss of the [Memory of the Old Iron King](/Memory+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the Old Iron King"), who wields a large katana that inflicts bleed damage. Is found at the end of the memory after going through a small army's worth of Alonne Knights, some of which wield greatbows.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 80,000   
**Weakness:** Strike**Resistance : **Slash, Thrust, Fire, Lightning, Magic, Dark  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * Similar to Raime, Sir Alonne has high defence towards non-physical damage.
  * Sir Alonne also follows the DLC trend of prolonging attacks. He has a tendency to wind up an attack but will only follow through with it a half to a full second later. This will severely punish players who dodge when the animation begins rather than when the hit lands. He is aggressive, and only a few of his attacks will allow you time to heal.
  * If you manage to kill Sir Alonne flawlessly within specific time, his death animation will change to him committing ritual suicide in the manner of a samurai, known in Japanese as seppuku. In addition, bowing immediately after entering the fog will delay his initial attack (needs confirmation).

###  [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King")

###  [Burnt Ivory King](/Burnt+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Burnt Ivory King")

Boss of the [Old Chaos](/Old+Chaos "Dark Souls 2 Old Chaos"), found after falling through the hole inside the Cathedral.  
  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 80,000 (with both summons)  
**Weakness:** Lightning, Dark

**Resistance** : Poison/Toxic, Fire  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * The boss is extremely difficult to fight solo, it is recommended to explore the DLC and find at least two of the three hidden Loyce Knights, in order to seal the portals and prevent the Burnt Loyce Knights from spawning while fighting the Burnt Ivory King.
  * When he buffs his sword is blue, his attacks will do bonus damage that go through shields; his attacks will also do bonus damage to stamina.
  * While his sword is buffed, he will often try to do a stab motion; it is unblockable, and impales you on his sword where you lose most, if not all, stamina, and take some major damage. If you do get hit, make sure that you try to walk away at first and try to dodge his next attack, which is usually immediately after you get up.
  * Phantoms are important here to distract the Ivory King as well as the Burnt Loyce knights, giving you a chance to heal.

### [ Aava, the King's Pet](/Aava,+the+King's+Pet "Dark Souls 2 Aava, the King's Pet")

Boss of [Frozen Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Eleum Loyce"), found just past the first bonfire. After the large door across the bridge go left and down the stairs. The entrance is immediately ahead.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 78,000  
**Weakness:** Fire, Dark 

**Resistance** : Magic  
**Optional** : No  
  
**Notes:**

  * Without a specific item, "Eye of the Priestess", in possession, Aava will remain invisible through the fight. 
  * A large tiger-creature with a standard moveset. However, its attacks are very punishing. It will create what may aptly be described as Homing Crystal Soulmass, but ice-themed, which have moderately-good tracking but deal more than just magic/physical damage. It will also use a DLC version of Wrath of the Gods(ice themed). When it rears its paw to hit the ground, ice crystals will erupt in an AoE arc.
  * Attacks let youre weapon break pretty fast

###  [Lud and Zallen, the King's Pets](/Lud+and+Zallen%2C+the+King%27s+Pets "Dark Souls 2 Lud and Zallen%2C the King%27s Pets")

Optional Bosses that Reside in the [Frigid Outskirts](/Frigid+Outskirts "Dark Souls 2 Frigid Outskirts"). Two giant black tigers with the same moveset as Aava.  
  
**Souls Awarded:** 56,000  
Weakness**:** Fire  
**Optional** : Yes  
  
**Notes:**

  * This boss battle is meant to be fought in co-op. There are two NPC summons available immediately to the left at the start of the area.
  * When Lud's health falls below 33%, you should kill him as quickly as possible. Zallen will join the battle, and both of them performing a lunge attack or launching their homing missile attacks is difficult to defend against. Having one or two phantoms with you makes Zallen join faster (50% or 66% respectively). 
  * When Zallen's HP reaches 20%, he will cast a buff and start regenerating health (up to 60%) and gaining increased defense (150%) and damage (120%). (Unsure if Lud can do the same thing. Need confirmation if only Zallen can use this buff) You can try and kill Zallen in this stage, but unless you didn't bring phantoms it's advised to stay away, since he will probably regenerate faster than you can deal damage.

**Weakness: None**(but does take more damage from Magic and Lightning)**(has been said by IGN)** as stated by IGN

* * *

  1. Note: This boss can be optional if you decide to fight The Pursuer and [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry") instead.
  2. It IS possible to summon dark phantoms (red). These will be changed by the chasm into Abyssal Spirits, giving the invader the same pure black appearance as everyone else. While you're an abyss spirit you can attack the other npc abyss spirits. You can not join the summoner for the boss fight, however. Credit to Paragon from the Redeemers of the Night from the **forums** for this.
