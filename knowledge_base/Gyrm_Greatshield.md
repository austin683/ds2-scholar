**Gyrm Greatshield** is a [ Greatshield](/Greatshields "Dark Souls 2 Greatshields") in Dark Souls 2. **Greatshields** can be used not only to block an enemy but allows player to do **shield bash**(Great shields replaced parry ability with heavy shield bash).

     _"A greatshield used by the nomadic Gyrm._

     _Appears to be a stone monument that was converted into a makeshift shield. Naturally,  
it is quite heavy, and haphazardly crafted, but very few attacks will make it past this monster."_

### Acquired From:

  * Random drop off of [Gyrm Warriors](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior") in [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros").

### Gyrm Greatshield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with titanite shards/chunks/slab. Monstrous stability and the default 100% Physical and Fire damage reduction make this a very, very powerful shield - in particular when dealing with dragons.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Useful on negating the artilleries in [Memory of Jeigh](/Memory+of+Jeigh "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Jeigh") before fighting against [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord"), and also useful against [Fire Salamander](/Fire+Salamander "Dark Souls 2 Fire Salamander") and [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress "Dark Souls 2 Desert Sorceress")
  * Use this shield for the [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon"). if you position yourself far away when he fire breaths it will hit your shield twice. This makes the fight much easier.
  * Extremely useful against [Sinh, The Slumbering Dragon](/Sinh%2C+the+Slumbering+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Sinh%2C the Slumbering Dragon") because it completely blocks his flame except its toxin, also you mostly won't be knocked down by his flame if you raised this shield.
