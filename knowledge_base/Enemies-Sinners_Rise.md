## Sinners' Rise Enemies

  

  

###  [Royal Swordsman](/Royal+Swordsman)

  

_The Royal Swordsman were chosen from the bravest of King Vendrick's men, and provided them with the best armor available for the war against the Giants. However, very few survived the battles. While they may be no match for Giants, they still pose a threat when they attack you in numbers_   
  
Royal Swordsmen are encountered in [The Lost Bastille](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Lost+Bastille) and [Drangleic Castle](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Drangleic+Castle). They are often found in teams of around 3-4 soldiers and they will work together to overwhelm the player. They wield greatswords and crossbows.   
Though both of them look alike, the Castle variant are more aggressive and can do more damage. Standing their ground when using the crossbow and switching weapons only when the player approaches within a few units of distance.   
  
They are weak to Thrust (i.e. Spears) type attacks. 

  

  

###  [Rupturing Hollow](/Rupturing+Hollow) (Undead Citizen)

  

Mummified hollows which, when they detect a player, charge them at high speed. You can detect them early by the rattling of their chains. Often occur in groups. Their speed and aggression is intimidating and can force the player into a defensive, pressed battle. All Undead Citizens have a devastating "belly flop attack" -- see [Rupturing Hollow page](/Rupturing+Hollow) for details and variants. 

  

  

###  [Undead Aberration](/Undead+Aberration) (Enhanced Undead)

  

Grotesque monstrosities found wading in the dark water in [Sinners' Rise](/Sinners'+Rise "Sinners' Rise"), they attack much like the Titanite Demons from Dark Souls; they are slow but can hit extremely hard. They have a massive resistance to magic and fire damage, and also seem to resist lightning. They are not resistant to poison or bleed damage. They are difficult to fight in the water, but can be lured over to the elevator platform where one can hit them with ranged attacks or bait them to fall into the hole.   
  
They're believed to be Lord Aldia's attempt on recreating the dragons, these test subjects are either failed attempt or the the first step of mutation, since their bones are formed in the shape of a dragon.   
  
_This deformed, unnatural creature must surely be the product of some serious misdeeds. Who created this monstrosity, and is it what they intended to make? It almost seems to be half-dragon, but, whatever it is, it has a mind of a Hollow_   
  
Being a member of the Bell Keeper Covenant will make the Shield and Bow drop with very high frequency.

  

  

###  Dark Spirit - [Prisoned Sinner](/Prisoned+Sinner) **NG+**

  

In [New Game Plus](/New+Game+Plus), a red phantom pyromancer, two of which appear in the room when [The Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner) drops to around 60% health. Note that the pyromancers do not appear with the use of a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic) in NG. 

  

  

###  Roaming Soul - [Rupturing Hollow](/Rupturing+Hollow#Roaming+Soul) (Undead Citizen) **NG+**

  

Mummified hollows which, when they detect a player, charge them at high speed. You can detect them early by the rattling of their chains. Often occur in groups. Their speed and aggression is intimidating and can force the player into a defensive, pressed battle. All Undead Citizens have a devastating "belly flop attack" -- see [Rupturing Hollow page](/Rupturing+Hollow) for details and variants. 

  

  

###  Roaming Soul - [Gaoler](/Gaoler) (Undead Jailer) **NG+**

  

Gaolers are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered on a wooden watchtower beyond the [Exile Holding Cells](/Exile+Holding+Cells) bonfire.   
  
_The Undead Jailers of the Lost Bastille carry primitive weapons intended to instill fear and can even use pyromancy to burn escapees, and intruders, to a crisp. The Jailers are wrapped in bandages. What lies beneath? Have they been burned by their own flames, or are they hiding a darker secret?_   
  

  * Gaolers are prison wardens of the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille). They wield great, brutish machetes to evoke fear in prisoners who dare to escape 
  * Gaolers have adequate amounts of HP, move fairly quickly, and deal significant damage. Their polearms give their attacks great range
  * Gaolers tend to poke players at long range, sweep at close range, and attempt to grab and chase players at close to medium range
  * Gaolers have great reach with their weapons, but their attacks and turning speed are sluggish. They can also be staggered by consecutive attacks
