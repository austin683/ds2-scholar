### Shrine of Amana Walkthrough

### Access

From the [Mirror Knight](/Mirror+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Mirror Knight") boss fight, head straight to the area with the circular platform ahead. Standing on the crest in the middle will activate it and send you down a long way. However before doing this, hug the short barrier on the left until you can turn into it and make a U-turn on it, to find a chest. This chest contains a [Soul Bolt](/Soul+Bolt "Dark Souls 2 Soul Bolt"), [Spell Quartz Ring +2](/Spell+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Spell Quartz Ring"), and 3x [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). At the bottom, proceed through the hole in the wall, and take a right at the torch. Here you'll find a [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"), inclosed by roots -take your weapon to it, and claim your loot, then head in the other direction. Continue until you reach the [Tower of Prayer Bonfire](/Tower+of+Prayer "Dark Souls 2 Tower of Prayer").

### Meet-o Milfanito

From this [bonfire](/Tower+of+Prayer "Dark Souls 2 Tower of Prayer"), head down the stairs and take the door to your left. Through here you'll notice an item on some branches on your left that you cannot pick up, so break the branches that hold it up, so you can claim it later on. Right ahead you'll also find an [Archdrake Pilgrim](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim"), and a trail leading to an opening on the right. In here you'll find a chest with 2x [Wilted Dusk Herb](/Wilted+Dusk+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Wilted Dusk Herb") and [Skeptic's Spice](/Skeptic%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic%27s Spice"), and a [Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk"). Head back to the ruined tower, and proceed down the staircase into an area, mainly submerged in water, and find a [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier") under the stairs. There is also a [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") by the exit that leads to the next area.

This room, and the coming ones are filled with partially submerged, walkable areas. You can walk into the water, but be careful not to fall through the deep pits. While these ledges are tough to see under the water, you can use a torch to see them more clearly; however, the light from the torch will attract any surrounding [Amana Aberrations,](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") so try to use [Cast Light](/Cast+Light "Dark Souls 2 Cast Light") instead as it does the job without the added trouble.

Upon entering, you will see an [Archdrake Pilgrim](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") ahead and on the right, who will attack you on sight, and [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") hiding in the water along the rocky trail for the rest of the area. Some noteworthy notes on these enemies: 

  * They are being kept calm by the beautiful song you've probably noticed by now.
  * Beware though that going close to them or carrying a torch will aggro them.
  * You can see the tops of their heads peek out of the water. 
    * If singing is present, a yellow sparkle effect over their locations.
  * You can also lock onto them from a distance before they aggro.

To the right of the path, you'll notice some rocks sticking out of the water. Go to them and hug them -or use a light source to check where you can walk- and make your way around them to find a [Flame Butterfly](/Flame+Butterfly "Dark Souls 2 Flame Butterfly") and a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). Head back and notice the left of the rocky path, if you search carefully, you'll find a chest containing [Elizabeth Mushroom](/Elizabeth+Mushroom "Dark Souls 2 Elizabeth Mushroom") (the chest on the very left border before the deep water begins, start at the beginning of the rocky path, move to the left till you are at the border, and then move the border a bit upwards to find the chest). More obviously and still on the left, you'll find a small rocky platform holding a corpse with 2x [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). At the end of this path, you'll find a hut.

Once you get in close to the hut, the song will stop and any remaining [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") will attack you. Inside the hut you will find [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito"). She will tell you about her sisters, some lore, and will give you a [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth & Silky Stone") if you exhaust her dialog. If you circle around her hut, you'll find a chest with 3x [Crimson Water](/Crimson+Water "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Water") and some curse jars. However tempting it may seem, do not kill any [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito")! Antagonizing her or her sisters will revoke your ability to seek help from them to turn you human when you're out of [Human Effigies](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy")!

### Misty Cave

Proceed through the hut and open the door in the back to continue. This path will show several drops, [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration"), and three [Archdrake Pilgrims](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") at the far end of the cavern. The first drop you come across is a [Bleeding Serum](/Bleeding+Serum "Dark Souls 2 Bleeding Serum") on the right, in the water. Right by it on the main path, you'll find a total of 2x [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead") and a [Skeptic's Spice](/Skeptic's+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic's Spice"), a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight") and 3x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). The [Pilgrims](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") mentioned earlier also attack you when you've reached this point. Right before abandoning the path, and heading into the cave, to the left you'll find an [Amana Aberration](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") guarding a partially submerged-chest in water, containing a [Dragon Charm](/Dragon+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Charm").

Inside the tunnel, the first cave-room on the left contains four [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") and a chest containing a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") and 3x [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth & Silky Stone"). A lone [Poison Brumer](/Poison+Brumer "Dark Souls 2 Poison Brumer") will approach you around this mini cave. Come back out to the tunnel you were traversing, and continue until you hit a mist wall.

### Another Dragonrider? 

Upon exiting the mist and tunnel, ahead is another similar stone path with the crumbling ruins to your right, providing the **Crumbled Ruins Bonfire** inside. The smartest move right now is to go and rest at the bonfire since a death here is not so uncommon, and having to traverse the whole area you just did _again_ , would not be ideal. Back on the path and way down the line is a new enemy type, the [Amana Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess"), that will shoot homing soul arrows at you from a long distance which deal a lot of magic damage. They also usually have [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") somewhere around them, so be careful when approaching them. Avoid fighting in the water unless it's absolutely necessary, ideally rushing the nearby [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") and pulling all the [Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") onto the stone path before dealing with the further [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess").

Near the area with the first [Amana Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess"), you should notice a ramp leading into the air. Just past it and to the left, near the big gate, is a submerged [Pharros' Contraption](/Pharros'+contraptions "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' contraptions"). Activate it to reveal a hidden wall, leading to a little cave with a chest containing the [Helix Halberd](/Helix+Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Helix Halberd"). Also when passing the ramp on the right, an [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") wielding a hammer will approach and attack you. After dealing with this, look to the left for a hidden pathway in the water, close to the third [Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess")**.** Ignore that path for now, as you need to find [King Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") first and be in human form to open the door at the end of the path. There will also be a [DragonRider](/DragonRider "Dark Souls 2 DragonRider") guarding this path.

### This is Getting Tricky

In the opposite direction of that path is another [Amana Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") waiting, with a corpse containing a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed") next to her**.** Ahead on the left, you will notice a path with a [Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") who may or may not be already attacking you, next to an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre"). Try to snipe her with a bow from here, then proceed towards the platform she was standing on, killing the [Aberration](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") that pops up before dealing with the [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre"). There will also be another [Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") by the upcoming hut that could do with some killing too. Follow the path killing any [Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") that jump out, until you reach the second hut. Inside the hut there is an [Old Radiant Lifegem](/Old+Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Old Radiant Lifegem"), a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight"), and a [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth & Silky Stone"); as well as an summon sign for [Lone Hunter Schmidt](/Lone+Hunter+Schmidt "Dark Souls 2 Lone Hunter Schmidt").

### Quick Detour (Can be Skipped)

There is another more hidden and dangerous pathway in the water after the [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre"). The pathway is under the columns, is guarded by two [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") and a couple of [Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration"), and is very narrow so watch your step. An [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard") and the [Miracle Sunlight Blade](/Sunlight+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Blade") (in the Chest behind the Corpse) is waiting there. The narrow path will begin on the right of the second column, after that, the path is going left of the columns. As with the other paths, a torch is not required, but helps finding the path.

### Back to Tricky

Once you leave the hut, there will be an [Archdrake Pilgrim](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") a few meters ahead. Lure him then kill him, then before moving to the left, carefully check the right side. There is a hard-to-see chest which contains [Fire Tempest](/Fire+Tempest "Dark Souls 2 Fire Tempest"). From the door, carefully head about stright-right, if you can't find it immidiately, circle around the border carefully. Be carefull to not go too close to circle of Cursed Urns, if they are in your way, get rid of them (a Bow and Iron Arrows works best here).

After that, going left from the hut, you will find yourself near the ruins. Come close to them but don't go any further as there are -you guessed it- another two [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") on the other end who will snipe you with Soul Arrows. Use cover and try to shoot them down. Be aware of [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") and [Archdrake Pilgrims](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") that might pose a melee threat to you as well. There will be also one [Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") ahead who heals other enemies and herself instead of attacking you. After dealing with all threats, head a bit back, while looking to the walls on the right. You will eventually come across an cave opening with another [Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") and a [Archdrake Pilgrim](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") in front of it. Deal with them, then destroy the roots with your weapon. Inside, another [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") and a corpse with [Singer's Dress](/Singer's+Dress "Dark Souls 2 Singer's Dress") and a [Life Ring +2](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") are waiting inside.

You may notice a fog gate but head to the left side of the area to find another two [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") next to a upward-sloping column holding a skeleton with 3x [Alluring Skull](/Alluring+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Alluring Skull"), at the top. While to the right of the fog gate, is a very thin ledge with a corpse holding a [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero") and a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing") -HUG THAT WALL. There is another item visible from here, but we can't reach it from here.

### Boss Fight: The Musical

Once you have cleared the area, enter the mist into a cavern with a single file line of [Poison Brumers](/Poison+Brumer "Dark Souls 2 Poison Brumer"); deal with them and use [Rhoy's Resting Place bonfire](/Rhoy%27s+Resting+Place "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy%27s Resting Place") on the left. You can summon [Felicia the Brave](/Felicia+the+Brave "Dark Souls 2 Felicia the Brave") her if you like, she is very helpful for the upcoming battle. On the way to the exit, more [Poison Brumers](/Poison+Brumer "Dark Souls 2 Poison Brumer") as well as a [Great Poison Brumer](/Great+Poison+Brumer "Dark Souls 2 Great Poison Brumer") will be in the way. Once you exit the cavern, there will be a mix of [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") that will start shooting you from a distance and [Archdrake Pilgrims](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") that will attack you as well. Run forward towards the column that has a torch on it and snipe them from behind it. Moving to the right, continuing behind the columns, you will come across a corpse holding [Homing Crystal Soul Mass](/Homing+Crystal+Soul+Mass "Dark Souls 2 Homing Crystal Soul Mass"). Moving to your left, kill the [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") along the way, and [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess"). Here you should pick up quite a bit of loot, this should include :

  * 1x [Sceptic's Spice](/Skeptic's+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic's Spice")
  * [Red Iron Twinblade](/Red+Iron+Twinblade "Dark Souls 2 Red Iron Twinblade")
  * 1x [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight")
  * 1x [Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Brave Warrior")
  * 1x [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone")
  * [Homing Crystal Soul Mass](/Homing+Crystal+Soul+Mass "Dark Souls 2 Homing Crystal Soul Mass")

Head back to the exit of the cave and before going in, turn to the left. Follow the thin path (hug the wall) to retrive the item we ignored before: a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight") and a [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"). Continue forward down the path and you will be invaded by [Peculiar Kindalur](/Peculiar+Kindalur "Dark Souls 2 Peculiar Kindalur"). Make sure not to have homing soul mass or crystal homing soul mass as it will autolock onto the [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito") as an enemy and kill her, as you want to free her. At the end of the path, near a pillar with a torch is another corpse with a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight") and a [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"). After taking the items, go into the hut to free the second [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito") (just "talk" with her and she will disappear into a cloud of light particles). Continue down and through the fog gate to face the boss.

BOSS FIGHT: [Demon of Song](/Demon+of+Song "Dark Souls 2 Demon of Song")

### Path to the Crypt

Killing this boss grants you 19,500 souls, the [Demon of Song Soul](/Demon+of+Song+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Demon of Song Soul"), and the [Key to the Embedded](/Key+to+the+Embedded "Dark Souls 2 Key to the Embedded"). From where you came in, head into the cave on the right, until you return to a stone path in a submerged area. Follow this path to the end then continue straight, through the two doorways, and you will shortly arrive at a staircase and find a few [Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") lurking. After taking care of them, head to the chest of them were guardiang to find 20x [Magic Arrows](/Magic+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Magic Arrow"). Take the stairs up the tower to find a petrified Hollow blocking your way. Use a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") to unpetrify him, then go inside to the [Rise of the Dead bonfire](/Rise+of+the+Dead "Dark Souls 2 Rise of the Dead").

At the top of the stairs above the bonfire is a door that can only be opened when you are hollow. Behind the door, 3 [Hollow Crawlers](/Hollow+Crawler "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Crawler") will greet you. After taking care of them, follow the path ahead, soon meeting a Hollow Pyromancer. Praying at the Altar in front of you lets you become human again, if you don't have any [Human Effigys](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") anymore (having any in your Inventory, Storage Chest and dropped them, the Altar does nothing).   
Behind the Altar is another [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito"), who whill reward you with a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed") for rescuring her sister, as well as a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing") for defeating the [Demon of Song](/Demon+of+Song "Dark Souls 2 Demon of Song"). Exhausting her dialog, she gives you a [Petrified Something](/Petrified+Something "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Something").  
Down the stairs by the altar you will find a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed") in a cave at the bottom guarded by another Hollow Pyromancer, with another one waiting outside. On the left of the staircase outside is a chest, containing the [Manslayer](/Manslayer "Dark Souls 2 Manslayer"); following the thin ledge on the right of the staircase leads to a chest containing a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic").  
  
Head back to the previous bonfire, then follow the rock path to the big door, guarded by a [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier"). There's an elevator here that will get you to [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt").

### Shrine of Amana Walkthrough

### Access

From the [Mirror Knight](/Mirror+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Mirror Knight") boss fight, head straight to the area with the circular platform ahead. Standing on the crest in the middle will activate it and send you down a long way. However before doing this, hug the short barrier on the left until you can turn into it and make a U-turn on it, to find a chest. This chest contains a [Soul Bolt](/Soul+Bolt "Dark Souls 2 Soul Bolt"), [Spell Quartz Ring](/Spell+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Spell Quartz Ring") +2, and 3x [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). At the bottom, proceed through the hole in the wall, and take a right at the torch. Here you'll find a [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"), inclosed by roots -take your weapon to it, and claim your loot, then head in the other direction. Continue until you reach the [Tower of Prayer Bonfire](/Tower+of+Prayer "Dark Souls 2 Tower of Prayer").

### Meet-o Milfanito

From this [bonfire](/Tower+of+Prayer "Dark Souls 2 Tower of Prayer"), head down the stairs and take the door to your left. Through here you'll notice an item on some branches on your left that you cannot pick up, so break the branches that hold it up, so you can claim it later on. Right ahead you'll find a trail leading to an opening on the right. In here you'll find a chest with 2x [Wilted Dusk Herb](/Wilted+Dusk+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Wilted Dusk Herb") and [Skeptic's Spice](/Skeptic%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic%27s Spice"), and a [Poison Brumer](/Poison+Brumer "Dark Souls 2 Poison Brumer"). Head back to the ruined tower, and proceed down the staircase into an area, mainly submerged in water, and find a [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier") under the stairs. 

This room, and the coming areas consist of partially submerged, walkable areas. You can walk into the water, but be careful not to fall through the deep pits. While these ledges are tough to see under the water, you can use a torch to see them more clearly; however, the light from the torch will attract any surrounding [Amana Aberrations,](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") so try to use [Cast Light](/Cast+Light "Dark Souls 2 Cast Light") instead as it does the job without the added trouble.

Upon entering, an [Archdrake Pilgrim](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") will attack you from the jump. This entire watery area is also riddled with [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") hiding in the water along the rocky trail for the rest of the area. Some noteworthy notes on these enemies: 

  * They are being kept calm by the beautiful song you've probably noticed by now.
  * You can see the tops of their heads peek out of the water. 
    * If singing is present, a yellow sparkle effect over their locations.
  * You can also lock onto them from a distance before they aggro.

To the right of the path, you'll notice some rocks sticking out of the water. Go to them and hug them -or use a light source to check where you can walk- and make your way around them to find a [Flame Butterfly](/Flame+Butterfly "Dark Souls 2 Flame Butterfly") and a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). Head back and notice the left of the rocky path, if you search carefully, you'll find a chest containing [Elizabeth Mushroom](/Elizabeth+Mushroom "Dark Souls 2 Elizabeth Mushroom"). More obviously and still on the left, you'll find a small rocky platform holding a corpse with 2x [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). At the end of this path, you'll find a hut.

Once you get in close to the hut, the song will stop and any remaining [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") will attack you. Inside the hut you will find [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito"). She will tell you about her sisters, some lore, and will give you a [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth %26 Silky Stone"), if you exhaust her dialog. If you circle around her hut, you'll find a chest with 3x [Crimson Water](/Crimson+Water "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Water") and some curse jars. However tempting it may seem, do not kill any [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito")! Antagonizing her or her sisters will revoke your ability to seek help from them to turn you human when you're out of [Human Effigies](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy")!

### Misty Cave

Proceed through the hut and open the door in the back to continue. This path will show several drops, [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration"), and three [Archdrake Pilgrims](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") at the far end of the cavern. Right on the main path, you'll find a total of 2x [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead") and a [Skeptic's Spice](/Skeptic's+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic's Spice"), a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight") and 3x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). The [Pilgrims](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") mentioned earlier also attack you when you've reached this point. Right at the entrance to the cave, to the left you'll find an [Amana Aberration](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") guarding a partially submerged-chest in water, containing a [Dragon Charm](/Dragon+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Charm"). 

Inside the tunnel, the first cave-room on the left contains four [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") and a chest containing a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") and 3x [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth & Silky Stone"). A lone [Poison Brumer](/Poison+Brumer "Dark Souls 2 Poison Brumer") will approach you around this mini cave. Come back out to the tunnel you were traversing, and continue until you hit a mist wall.

### Another Dragonrider? 

Upon exiting the mist and tunnel, ahead is another similar stone path with the crumbling ruins to your right, providing a second bonfire inside. The smartest move right now is to go and rest at the bonfire since a death here is not so uncommon, and having to traverse the whole area you just did _again_ , would not be ideal.

Back on the path and way down the line is a new enemy type, the [Amana Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess"), that will shoot homing soul arrows at you from a long distance which deal a lot of magic damage. They also usually have [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") somewhere around them, so be careful when approaching them. Avoid fighting in the water unless it's absolutely necessary, ideally rushing the nearby [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") and pulling all the [Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") onto the stone path before dealing with the further [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess"). Near the area with the first [Amana Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess"), you should notice a ramp leading into the air. Just past it and to the left, near the wall, is a submerged Pharros Lock Contraption. Activate it to reveal a chest containing the [Helix Halberd](/Helix+Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Helix Halberd"). 

After dealing with this, look to the left for a hidden pathway in the water, close to where the third [Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess")**.** Use it to get the cave that holds the [Soul of the King](/Soul+of+the+King "Dark Souls 2 Soul of the King") and [King's Set](/King%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Set"). While hidden, the path is quite easy to spot as it is a straight path, and is guarded by a [DragonRider](/DragonRider "Dark Souls 2 DragonRider"). The door that separates you from the goodies mentioned earlier, is only unlocked once the optional boss King [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"), is killed, and you are in human form.

### This is Getting Tricky

Once back at the spot of the third [Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess"), you should be able to se an item on right as well as another [Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") -this item is a [Dragon Charm](/Dragon+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Charm")**.** Ahead on the right, you will notice a path with a [Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") who may or may not be already attacking you, next to an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre"). Try to snipe her with a bow from here, then proceed towards the platform she was standing on, killing the [Aberration](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") that pops up before dealing with one-eyed shrek there *1.

There will also be another [Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") by the upcoming hut that could do with some killing too. Follow the path killing any [Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") that jump out, until you reach the second hut. Inside the hut there is an [Old Radiant Lifegem](/Old+Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Old Radiant Lifegem"), a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight"), and a summon sign for [Felicia the Brave](/Felicia+the+Brave "Dark Souls 2 Felicia the Brave"); the summon is quite helpful for the upcoming fight.

### Quick Detour (Can be Skipped)

There is another more hidden and dangerous pathway in the water after the [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre"). The pathway is under the columns, is guarded by two [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") and a couple of [Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration"), and is very narrow so watch your step. An [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard") and the [Miracle Sunlight Blade](/Sunlight+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Blade") (in the Chest behind the Corpse) is waiting there. Where in other areas you could get away with not using a torch, here it is absolutely vital as the path becomes tricky and not so straightforward; to avoid having to pop a Flame Butterfly every 10 seconds, make sure you get the offensive advantage on the [Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") and use the pillars to block the damage from the [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess").

### Back to Tricky

Once you leave the hut, there will be an [Archdrake Pilgrim](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") that will attack immediately. Move to the left, carefully check the right side. There is a hard-to-see chest which contains [Fire Tempest](/Fire+Tempest "Dark Souls 2 Fire Tempest"). You will not see any messages, as it will be submerged, but sometimes, a prompt will appear on the screen. This lets you know you're getting close. Be aware of the bunch of Cursing Urns around! From the Cursed Urns, if you have your back to the hut, the chest is located a good walk northwest (Seeing as a clock, it would be at about 10-11 hours. Use a torch or Cast Light for better visibility).

After that, going left from the hut, you will find a spot covered by branches. Hack the branches down and kill the [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") to find a [Life Ring](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") +2 and a [Singer's Dress](/Singer's+Dress "Dark Souls 2 Singer's Dress"). Now head back out and be aware of [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") and [Archdrake Pilgrims](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") that might pose a melee threat to you.

You may notice a fog gate but head to the left side of the area to find another two [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") next to a upward-sloping column holding a skeleton with 3x [Alluring Skull](/Alluring+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Alluring Skull"), at the top. This part might be a little tricky since they always snipe you from a long distance, so use cover. While to the right of the fog gate, is a very thin ledge with a corpse holding a [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero") and a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing") -HUG THAT WALL.

### Boss Fight: The Musical

Once you have cleared the area, enter the mist into a cavern with a single file line of [Poison Brumers](/Poison+Brumer "Dark Souls 2 Poison Brumer") and a giant one; deal with them and use [Rhoy's Resting Place bonfire](/Rhoy%27s+Resting+Place "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy%27s Resting Place") on the left. Once you exit the cavern, there will be a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight") on the right of the exit. There will also be a mix of [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") that will start shooting you from a distance and [Archdrake Pilgrims](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") that will attack you as well. Run forward towards the column that has a torch on it and snipe them from behind it. Moving to the right, continuing behind the columns, you will come across a corpse holding [Homing Crystal Soulmass](/Homing+Crystal+Soulmass "Dark Souls 2 Homing Crystal Soulmass"). Moving to your left, kill the [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") along the way, and [Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess"). Here you should pick up quite a bit of loot, this should include :

  * 1x [Sceptic's Spice](/Skeptic's+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic's Spice")
  * [Red Iron Twinblade](/Red+Iron+Twinblade "Dark Souls 2 Red Iron Twinblade")
  * 1x [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight")
  * 1x [Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Brave Warrior")
  * 1x [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone")
  * [Homing Crystal Soulmass](/Homing+Crystal+Soulmass "Dark Souls 2 Homing Crystal Soulmass")

Continue forward to another hut and you will be invaded by [Peculiar Kindular](/Peculiar+Kindular "Dark Souls 2 Peculiar Kindular"). Make sure not to have homing soulmass or crystal homing soulmass as it will autolock onto the [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito") as an enemy and kill her, as you want to free her. Continue down to face the boss.

BOSS FIGHT: [Demon of Song](/Demon+of+Song "Dark Souls 2 Demon of Song")

### Path to the Crypt

After the boss fight, off to the right when you face the undead crypt door, is a semi-hidden path to a tower. Inside the tower is the [Rise of the Dead bonfire](/Rise+of+the+Dead "Dark Souls 2 Rise of the Dead"), and near to the bonfire entrance is also a chest with 20x [Magic Arrows](/Magic+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Magic Arrow").

At the top of the stairs above the bonfire is a door that can only be opened when you are undead- so if you want access but you're human, kill yourself-, and have talked to all the [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito") to open it or come back here later. Behind the door are some undead worshippers and [Aldia Warlock](/Aldia+Warlock "Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock"). Beyond them is the shrine with a [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito"). Talk to the lady to get rewards, and when you run out of [Human Effigies](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") you can revive here using the burning altar as long as you are on good terms.

Down the stairs by the altar you will find a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed") in a cave at the bottom guarded by another pyromancer enemy, and outside another pyromancer enemy. On both sides of the staircase are chests, one with the [Manslayer](/Manslayer "Dark Souls 2 Manslayer") katana and on the opposite side is a ledge that leads to a chest containing a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). Careful though, as the ledge is quite thin.   
  
Now , go back to the previous bonfire, then lead your way back to the big door ahead, guarded by a Syan Knight. There's an elevator that will get you to [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt").
