### Moon Butterfly Cuffs Description

_"Gauntlets made from wings of the rare moon butterfly. Poisons those who approach its wearer."_  
  
_"Little is known about the moon butterfly, which only appears on full-moon nights in winter. Some say the butterfly is a magical being, and its larvae have never once been spotted."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * [Maughlin the Armorer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer), in [Majula](/Majula) (Only available in NG+ & the hat requires NG++ (bonfire intensity 3) after spending 16000+ souls with him.
  * In other words, you need to burn two Bonfire Ascetics in Majula to get the entire set)

###
