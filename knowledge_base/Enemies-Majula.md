## Majula Enemies

  

  

###  [Skeleton](/Skeleton)

  

Skeletons are enemies in Dark Souls II. They can first be encountered in the basement of the [Majula Mansion](/Majula+Mansion). They are reanimated remains of humanoids, and manifestations of necromancy. In most cases, if a skeleton is nearby, so is a [Hollow Mage (Black)](/Hollow+Mage+%28Black%29). This is not true for the [Majula](/Majula) and [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley) skeleton. Those that are slain can be revived repeatedly by a nearby [Hollow Mage (Black)](/Hollow+Mage+%28Black%29), until the Hollow Mage is killed. Skeletons are relatively weak, both in damage and HP, but move and attack swiftly. They also have the ability to parry, if carrying a shield. They are extremely resilient to thrust (i.e. spear) based attacks, somewhat resistant to slash (i.e. sword) based attacks, and weak against strike (i.e. mace) based attacks. Oddly, skeletons are vulnerable to [Yearn](/Yearn) and [Alluring Skull](/Alluring+Skull), as they're mindless, in short, [Force](/Force) can dispatch them by pushing them to bottomless pit.   
  
_"This curved sword-wielding Skeleton is hiding in Cale's house in Majula. It's unknown whose Skeleton this might be or what force animates it; perhaps Cale inadvertently disturbed this poor soul's resting place. Either way, it must be dispatched before Cale will return to the residence… and if you want the treasures it guards." - Majula Skeleton Description_   
  
_"These reanimated corpses are often under the control of a Necromancer, and they will be revived repeatedly until their Wizard is killed. Whether they served the Iron King or fled from his troops in life makes no difference now, as they are the property of their necromantic masters" - Huntsman's Copse Skeleton Description_   
  
_The skeletons in this region are of unknown origins. They could be former subjects of the Iron King who were worked to death in the poisonous mines or poor Souls who wandered in more recently. Regardless, whether it was the massive Pools of Poison or giant monsters overseeing the Laborers, something killed these poor fools… but they've left it to you to finish the job." - Harvest Valley Skeleton Description_

**N** **ote on Names:**   
This wiki uses the name "Skeleton" to refer to all skeletons in the game.   
FarFire and FuturePress use "Helmed Skeleton" and "Armored Skeleton", respectively, in referring to the later game skeletons in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse). 

  

  

###  [Undead Devourer (Enslaved Pig)](/Undead+Devourer)

  

Undead Devourers are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered on the right side of the mansion [Majula ](/Majula+Mansion).   

  * Undead Devourers appear to be small, hollowed boars. They are almost always encountered in groups
  * Undead Devourers move and attack slowly, as well as deal poor damage, but have high HP and can be a nuisance if attacking in groups
  * The three little piglets near the Majula mansion can sometimes be replaced with 2 larger boars, it seems that they appear after the 3 piglets have been killed numerous times by the player.
  * Once these 2 boars have been killed a couple of times, 1 very big boar replaces them. After it has been killed, no boars seem to respawn.
  * Giant Undead Devourers appear in NG+ at [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora). They cause bleed build up and can stagger players with low poise
  * Provided you can manage to hit them, [Soul Appease](/Soul+Appease) is an effective way to deal with them (the smaller pigs in Majula can be one hit Soul Appease, however they appear to be so small that if not on level ground the spell will "miss" them).
