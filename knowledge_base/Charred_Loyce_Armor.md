_"Charred Armor of the Knights of Loyce, burned black by flame._  
_These Knights of Loyce plunged into the old Chaos with their lord, and lost their sense of self._  
_To this day, they still burn in agony, alongside their once-proud king."_

### Location

  * Dropped by [Charred Loyce Knights](/Charred+Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Knight") in [The Old Chaos](/Old+Chaos "Dark Souls 2 Old Chaos").

### Notes

  * Part of the [Charred Loyce Set](/Charred+Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Set").
  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Upgraded physical defenses are only 25% higher.
  * To collect full set, either teleport back from [Burnt Ivory King](/Burnt+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Burnt Ivory King") fight or revisit the arena once he's defeated – Charred Loyce Knights start despawning after 20th run or so and disappear completely by 60th run.
  * Contrary to appearance, it actually has good physical defense for a medium armor, and is slightly better than default [Loyce Set](/Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Set"), although weighs a bit more and has only half the durability.
  * Each piece of the set absorbs 10 HP from each defeated foe **ONLY** if the wearer is female. This effect stacks between pieces, as well as with pieces of [Loyce Set](/Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Set"), [Ivory King set](/Ivory+King+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Ivory King Armor"), [Wicked Eye Greatshield](/Wicked+Eye+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Wicked Eye Greatshield"), [Butcher's Knife](/Butcher's+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Butcher's Knife") and any version of [Ring of the Evil Eye](/Ring+of+the+Evil+Eye "Dark Souls 2 Ring of the Evil Eye").
