### Dark Souls 2 Warped Sword Acquired From

### Warped Sword Hints and Tips in Dark Souls 2:

  * A powerful of all curved sword and a remarkably good weapon to counter and pressure heavier weapons like great swords.
  * While the attack rating is somewhat poor, the speed of attacks and the 25 poise damage more than makes up for it.
  * Used with Mundane in old patches, in current patch the path is outscaled by uninfused.
  * Has the highest counter damage of all curved swords allows you to do remarkable damage when trading hits with other fast weapons such as katanas.
  * Unique L2/LT Power Stance four-hit spin attack when wielded in either hand with any dagger or thrusting sword, or when wielded in right hand with any straight sword, katana or curved sword, except [Darkdrift](/Darkdrift "Dark Souls 2 Darkdrift") and [Bewitched Alonne Sword](/Bewitched+Alonne+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Bewitched Alonne Sword").
  * The Washing Pole and Spider Silk in particular add a lot of range to this unique spin.
  * Swords with unique R2 attacks keep their unique R2 when wielded in the right with the Warped Sword in the left. For daggers and thrusting swords with unique R2s, this means a unique R2 on either hand while in power stance.
  * If used with [Ivory Straight Sword](/Ivory+Straight+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Ivory Straight Sword"), it emits beam during spinning while the spin drains its durability twice.
