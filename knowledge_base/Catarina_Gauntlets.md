### Catarina Gauntlets Description

_"Helm/Armor/Gauntlets/Leggings-Distinctively shaped apparel worn by the Knights of Catarina._  
_Outside Catarina, they are often ridiculed for their onion-like shape, infuriating the proud knights, but masterfully forged curved design makes it very effective for parrying."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Rare drop from NPC [Dark Spirit Catarina Knight](/Catarina+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Catarina Knight") in forest of the giants (NG+).
  * [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower") treasure, behind destroyable wall with the enemies with barrels.

### Notes

  * There are only 2 Alonne Captain pieces (the helm and the chest-piece). The Gauntlets and Leggings are from the regular Alonne Knight set.
  * Upgraded with titanite shards.
  * Armor set has very good poise, and good defense for its weight.
  * The chest offers extremely high amount of fire resistance, highest in the game if fully upgraded for any heavy armor.
