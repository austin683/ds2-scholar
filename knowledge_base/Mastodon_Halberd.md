### Dark Souls 2 Mastodon Halberd Hints and Tips

  * Moveset identical to regular

[Halberd.](/Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Halberd")   
In particular, normal attack when shield is raised becomes a thrusting attack similar to that of a spear.

  * In PvP, hitting this weapon's 2 handed dashing attack will easily break through most opponents' guards or outright kill them if they take full damage from all 3 swings. This attack's range and damage are unbelievably good, although it does drain a lot of stamina.
  * To counter: either use high stability shields or focus on dodging behind the halberd wielder. They will be more vulnerable than most if their attacks are blocked (with a greatshield) or dodged.
  * This weapon's durability decreases faster than most other weapons in the game. Unlike with great weapons, it takes a durability penalty when hitting the floor, and this weapon's move animations causes it to hit the floor often. This weapon also takes an abnormal amount of durability damage when hitting monsters and even when being hit (without using it to block).
