**Lightning Spear** is a [Miracle](/Miracles "Dark Souls 2 Miracles") in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle.

> _"_ A miracle that launches a spear of lightning.  
> Said to be the legacy of an ancient clan whose leader was revered as the God of Sun.  
>   
> The name of the clan has been lost to time, but the gross incandescence of our magnificent father shall never wane."

### Acquired From

  * Purchase from [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt") for 6000 souls. Initially, she only sells one copy, but later sells three more and eventually unlimited copies of it when certain progress is made in the game.
  * After opening the [Shrine of Winter](/Shrine+of+Winter "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Winter"), she sells unlimited copies of the spell.
  * One can be found in a chest in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak"). After opening Pate's door from the other side, dropping down to the left of the door will reveal a pillared area -- in the back right corner is a chest with a Lightning Spear inside.

### Notes

  * The hurled bolt of lightning is considerably faster cast than its Dark Souls counterpart.
  * This spell has a small AoE that will affect the original target and enemies that stand close to the original target. The AoE does 20% of the damage of the original spear but still does a small amount of poise break.
  * If the enemy is in a river or any body of water, it will also conduct a small AoE that will also affect enemies within the blast radius.
  * Spell uses and damage were changed in Calibration 1.08. Both got nerfed despite patch notes saying it should do more damage.  

You can get up to 234 [Lightning spears](/Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Lightning Spear") by the time you get to Drangleic castle.

It actually works, you'll need the [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") gift or ones in iron keep and a [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel").

  
Cleric class, bf ascetic, progress through the game normally until dragon rider while only leveling int until 30, beat him and buy lightning spear, go to no man's wharf and talk to [Carhillion](/Carhillion+of+the+Fold "Dark Souls 2 Carhillion of the Fold") and get [Northern Ritual Band](/Northern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Northern Ritual Band") +1 with the 30 intelligence then reallocate your stats with a soul vessel into 22 faith for lightning spear (goes from 3 cast to 15 cast at 99 Att) and the rest into Attunement (If you don't know it raises Agility, cast speed, spell uses and Attunement slots).

Now go to shaded woods and beat [Scorpioness Najka](/Scorpioness+Najka "Dark Souls 2 Scorpioness Najka") then burn the bf ascetic and beat her again, this will give you the [Southern ritual band](/Southern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Southern Ritual Band") +2.

Now keep leveling Attunement until 99 then you can level something else (base cleric stats besides 22 Fai and 99 Att only takes 713,231 souls not including deaths.)

Beat all four lords or get 1 mil souls ([Old Iron King](/Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Old Iron King") is the best option for soul farming outside of [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord") and [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon")) then go to the shrine of winter.

  
Teleport to Majula and Licia should sell infinite lightning spears then equip the rings and spells then [Praise the sun!](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Solaire+of+Astora "Dark Souls 2 Solaire of Astora")

You got 234 lightning spears before Drangleic for some reason?!

  
You can get up to 280 with the +2 Northern Band and Black witch hat.

Here's the math.

  
Before Drang: (15 cast + 20% more cast) * 13 Spell slots (99 Att + Southern band +2) = 234 Cast

  
After Aldia's Keep: (15 cast + 30% more cast) * 14 Slots (99 Att + Southern band +2 + Witch hat) = 280 Lightning spear cast.
