  * Can be found past the Poison Pool bonfire in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley") sitting on a rock. Sells titanite shards. If you exhaust all her dialogue she will go to Majula, where she will start selling large titanite shards (limited at first, unlimited later in the game), and later most (if not all) other upgrade items.
  * She is also the daughter of the blacksmith in Majula, [Lenigrast](/Blacksmith+Lenigrast "Dark Souls 2 Blacksmith Lenigrast"). Talking to her, when she is in Majula, suggests that her father followed her to **Drangleic** without her knowledge.

### Stone Trader Chloanne Dialogue

**\- First Encounter (Harvest Valley)**  
Are you a traveller?   
I am Chloanne, an orestone trader.  
I travel about collecting rare stones, which I sell to make my living.  
I never planned to visit this gods-forsaken place.  
But I don't know… I just sort of ended up here.  
I must've just wandered in…Heh…  
But, now that I'm here, I've been scouting around for rare bits.  
Oh, don't look at me like that!  
Many of these stones are quite useful. For instance, certain stones are used in smithing.  
Ahh, now your ears prick up! Heh.  
I've extras, if you can pay. This is my trade, after all!

**\- Re-encounter**  
What? Do you need something?  
(or)  
I'll provide whatever service you need. For a fair price, of course!  
(or)  
You've been long away. What would you like?  
Well, I've only one thing to provide, and we both know what that is! Heh heh…

**\- Using Talk Option (Harvest Valley)**

  1. I came here in search of rare stones, but…  
The place is nothing like I was told. All this poison, and you can't get very far inside.  
Don't just go haplessly wandering about.
  2. These stones may look all the same, but to the trained eye, each is unique.  
Some of them are used to smith weapons and armour, and some unique stones provide special benefits.  
Some of them are extremely rare, and should be used with great thrift.  
None of the differences are easily spotted, but I've learned quite a lot, really! Heh.
  3. Drangleic…  
How is it that I ended up here?  
It's funny… I can't seem to remember.
  4. I've searched every nook and cranny here. I suppose it's time to move on.  
Perhaps we'll meet again, if we live that long! Heh.

**\- After exhausting dialog in Harvest Valley**  
I suppose it's about time I moved shop…

**\- Meeting again in Majula**  
Oh, fancy meeting you here.  
Speak up if you need anything at all. Alright?

**\- Using Talk Option (Majula)**

  1. These stones may look all the same, but to the trained eye, each is unique.  
Some of them are used to smith weapons and armour, and some unique stones provide special benefits.  
Some of them are extremely rare, and should be used with great thrift.  
None of the differences are easily spotted, but I've learned quite a lot, really! Heh.
  2. You know how they call this place Drangleic, right?  
Well, in the old lore, in stories and the like, they said it had another name…  
What was it? Well… I don't know, it's just something I heard.  
Since long, long ago, many kingdoms have risen and fallen on this very spot.  
Each like a great flame, that turns to soot.  
Maybe that's why people don't remember much about the past…
  3. You see that blacksmith over there?  
Is he one of those…Hollows? He seems to keep eyeing me up.  
He sort of looks like my father. He's a blacksmith, too, you see.  
The poor man's such a worrywort.  
But…he wouldn't follow me out here, would he?
  4. I was born in a land to the west, Volgen. Famous for its merchants.  
There were great, bustling cities.  
But for me, they were suffocating.  
And so I set out, in search of stones in faraway lands.  
There are dangers, for certain, but I much prefer to live this way.  
But…For the life of me, I can't remember how I ended up here…  
It's as if…I were drawn to the place… or lured in…Oh, I don't know…

**\- When gifting the player a Twinkling Titanite**  
Oh, I know! Take these.  
We can all do with a little help, can't we? I know I always can! Heh heh…

**\- Leaving after using her services**  
Visit me again, whenever you please.

**\- Leaving without using her services**  
No interest? Suit yourself.

**\- Leaving without exiting menu**  
Oi! Mind your manners!

**When attacked**  
What on earth?!  
What?!  
Fine, if that's the way it is… (aggroed)
