**Green Blossom** is a type of regeneration consumable in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Green Blossom** , a leafy flower-shaped green herb. Enhances the recovery speed of stamina for a short duration. Initially shunned for its distinctively bitter taste, the herb gained popularity among merchants as its beneficial effects were recognized. Today, wild specimens of this plant are exceptionally rare, nearing extinction. [Consumable Items](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") grant various effects such as restorative properties for recovering HP, removing certain negative status effects, applying temporary buffs and debuffs, as well as activating various actions and effects.

> At one point, this herb was avoided due to its uniquely bitter taste, but once its effects became known, it was harvested to near extinction by merchants. Now, only exceptionally rare, wild specimens of this plant are left.

### Green Blossom Usage in Dark Souls 2

  * Restorative item. Boosts [Stamina Recovery](/Stamina "Dark Souls 2 Stamina") speed for 60 seconds.
  * [Stamina Recovery](/Stamina "Dark Souls 2 Stamina") is roughly equal to 15%
  * Stacks with [Chloranthy Ring](/Chloranthy+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Chloranthy Ring") variants and [Stamina Recovery](/Stamina "Dark Souls 2 Stamina") shields. 
    * Green Blossom + Shield = ~20% faster Stamina Regen.
    * Green Blossom + Chloranthy Ring +2 = ~40% faster Stamina Regen.
    * Green Blossom + Shield + Cloranthy Ring +2 = ~43% faster Stamina Regen.

The Green Blossom may not stack with other stamina-boosting items as when consumed whilst using other stamina buffs, there is no green particle effect or noise; however when an item such as the Cloranthy ring is removed, the effect displays and the noise plays. Even non-stamina-related items like the Ring of Giants seem to interfere with the Green Blossom. (tested on ver. 1.02 calib. 1.06, maybe a visual bug) [Isn't that simply because there can only be one particle effect on your character at one time?]
