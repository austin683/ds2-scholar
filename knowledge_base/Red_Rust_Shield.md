**Red Rust Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Shield of the warrior Vengarl of Forossa._

     _The chisels on the face were carved by Vengarl, to count the heads he claimed.  
The shield is terribly rusted and worn, but incredibly powerful, as if the deeds of its previous owner have rubbed off on it."_

### Acquired From

  * Sold by [Head of Vengarl](/Head+of+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Head of Vengarl"), after you defeat his body, for 4500 Souls.

### Red Rust Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * On the shield are 80 carvings from Vengarl.
  * Shield has very low defenses vs. anything that isn't physical, poison, or bleed, even at +5.
  * Inflicts a decent amount of damage if used offensively.
