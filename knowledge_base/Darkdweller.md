### Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller (Dark Stalker) Information

_"'Spider monkey like creatures with very long arms. They attack quickly and are quite deadly. They can cause bleeding with 2-3 hits but are terrified of the light and will cower at the sight of it (e.g., a torch); however, if you provoke them for too long, they can rage out even in bright light. If possible, try and get behind them for a backstab, but be careful.__"_
