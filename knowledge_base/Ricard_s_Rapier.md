  * Tap once more during strong attack to land more hits.
  * The weapon has a relatively low durability of 45 so it breaks rather easy when spamming the heavy attack because each hit within the flurry counts towards the weapon durability.
  * In power stance with this weapon as your right hand your power stance strong attacks will use very little stamina, due to the stamina cost is seperated into each hit.
  * This weapon is very good to poison enemies when is poison infused, Can instantly poison some enemies with one heavy attack while using [Crest of the Rat](/Crest+of+the+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Crest of the Rat") and [Sanctum Soldier Gauntlets](/Sanctum+Soldier+Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier Gauntlets").
