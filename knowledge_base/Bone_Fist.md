**Bone Fist** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Bone Fist** is a hand-to-hand combat weapon obtained in the [Crown of the Ivory King DLC](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King"). Upgrading it to +5 with twinkling titanite enhances its capabilities. With 45 Dex and 22 Str for power stance, the heavy attack unleashes a high-damage projectile, proving effective in PvP. It can be power-stanced with other fist weapons, and the power stance strong attack offers substantial poise.

> Bone that is bound to the fist. Used to enhance hand-to-hand combat.   
>   
> Salvaged from a malformed creature.   
>  Enables one to fight with inhuman strength, as if the very spirit of the bone's malicious owner had taken control. 

###  **Acquired From**

  * DLC [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King").
  * Behind a door which is found through a side passage after you go through the door at the back of the room full of boxes (To the left of the door to the Abandoned Dwelling Bonfire). This door has 4 unlit fire stands which must be lit to open. To light these you must beat The King's Pet and talk to the Princess. Once through the door there is a wall you can activate on the immediate left (press A), follow that and it is on a body.
  * To replicate this item via bonfire ascetic one has to use the Outer Wall bonfire.
  * Frozen Reindeers drops these when summoned. Rare drop.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgraded with twinkling titanite to +5
  * When in power stance (requires 45 Dex and 22 Str) use the heavy attack to shoot a projectile, deals high damage and knocks down small humanoid enemies, extremely useful for PvP usage.
  * Can be powerstanced with any fist weapons or barehand, and the powerstance strong attack damage is affected only by the right weapon, although the powerstance strong attack can be used only when Bone Fist is equipped on the right hand.
  * Powerstance strong attack does not deplete the durability of [Vanquisher's Seal](/Vanquisher%27s+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Vanquisher%27s Seal") ring,
  * Compared to the other fist weapons the Bone fist is notably slower, the one handed strong attack is probably the only fast attack this weapon has with its quick low sweep to forced back punch, the running attack is a running flying kick that can send players and human sized enemies flying, however caution is warranted when you are facing a ledge as you can jump kick to your death, also there is a slight delay before you can move freely after and leaves open a back stab.The power stance strong attack takes 5 durability per Hadouken, the Bracing Knuckle Ring +2 does NOT drop the durability cost.
  * Your attack frames will give you immense poise (similar to swinging large weapons) that is incredibly hard to break and allows you to combo down opponents who try to to get into a literal fist fight with you.
  * Interesting Fact : the Bone Fist is actually still valuable even broken. The scaling is so high that it is still able to decent damage because it only loses the base damage when broken (which is 20 at +5)
  * The Bone Fist's strong attack resembles how Andre of Astora from the previous game fights, if the player aggros him.
  * The Bone Fist has 248 AR at 60 Str, 45 Dex.
  * The Bone Fist has 310 AR at 99 Str and Dex.
