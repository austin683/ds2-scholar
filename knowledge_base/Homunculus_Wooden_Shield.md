**Homunculus Wooden Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A shield with lumps attached to it. Found in the manor in Aldia. Heavier than a standard shield, but more stable owing to the hard lumps._

     _In the far eastern outskirts of Drangleic lies an old manor that is now long forgotten. As it should be, for the things that lurk there are better left unknown."_

  * Can be purchased from [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") after defeating the [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Knight").
