**Steel Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
_"Heavy steel [armor piece]_   
_A relic of an order of knights said to be the mightiest warriors of their time."_

###  Set Location

  * Found in [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro), in a chest behind an illusory wall next to the second Pharros' contraption.

  
  

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite).
  * Gauntlets offer the highest physical defense among armor pieces upgraded with regular Titanite. Other best pieces are: [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior+Set) Greathelm and chestpiece, [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper+Set) / [Mastodon](/Mastodon+Set) gauntlets and Mastodon / [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight+Set) leggings.
  * The set has high physical defense to weight ratio – the highest for heavy armor (22 def per 1 unit of weight), and high overall stats.
