**Varangian Shield** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Small Varangian shield engraved with a strange pattern._

     _A former king launched a campaign to capture these terrors of the high seas,  
but rather than imprison them, forced them into hard labor at No-man's Wharf."_
