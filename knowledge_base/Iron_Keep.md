## The Iron Keep

**The Iron Keep** presents a formidable fortress that was too heavy for its base and is thus sinking into lava. This area holds the [Dull Ember](/Dull+Ember "Dark Souls 2 Dull Ember") needed to unlock special upgrades at [Steady Hand McDuff's](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff") workshop. In SotFS this item is found at the [Tower Apart](/Tower+Apart "Dark Souls 2 Tower Apart") bonfire in the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille").

  * In NG+, two red phantom [Alonne Knight Captains](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") will spawn in the Furnace.
  * On the platform you with the lever that you used to roast two of the [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"), with the use of long ranged attacks and some crafty timing to lure the enemies into the many traps in this room, including the lever-controlled platform, it is entirely possible to kill most if not all the enemies in the room standing on the platform with the lever, making navigation around the room that much easier. 

### Iron Keep Walkthrough

### Dealing with the Fire

  * To reach items along the lava paths in this level, you will need either max health or stack fire defense such as [Flash Sweat](/Flash+Sweat "Dark Souls 2 Flash Sweat") and the [Flame Quartz Ring](/Flame+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flame Quartz Ring") +2. 
    * High fire resist gear, [Dragon Tooth](/Dragon+tooth "Dark Souls 2 Dragon tooth") are useful too.
    * Consuming 3-6 [Radiant Lifegems](/Radiant+lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant lifegem") can help to maintain HP. 
    * The [small orange burr](/small+orange+burr "Dark Souls 2 small orange burr") is also not a bad idea either, however, burr doesn't stack with [Flash Sweat](/Flash+Sweat "Dark Souls 2 Flash Sweat"). Other 
    * [Flash Sweat](/Flash+sweat "Dark Souls 2 Flash sweat") provides +300 fire defense.
  * Rolling into one of the **urns** scattered across the map/**water pools** produced from the area's [Pharros' Contraption](/Pharros%27+Contraption "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Contraption") mechanisms will also increase fire defense by 400.
  * It appears a minimum fire defense of around 600 is needed to be able to reach any items.

  * Killing the [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon") will make his armor available from the armorer in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). This armor has one of the, if not the highest fire defenses in the game, proving useful in getting these items. The armor itself is not cheap but neither is anything of quality, and could be worth buying before attempting to get the items across the fire paths.
  * With 1000+ fire defense, You'll still take damage but it should be minimal.
  * A [Ring of Soul Protection](/Ring+of+Soul+protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Soul protection") or [Ring of Life Protection](/Ring+of+life+protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of life protection") will allow you to grab the items without penalty at lower defenses.
  * 797 fire defense allowed the hardest one to be reached (below the mimic) for instance, but did not provide enough time to exit. You will die after looting the chest but won't lose any souls or humanity if you were inclined to be human

### Mage Magerold

As you enter the area, head down the stairs on your left for the **[Threshold Bridge bonfire](/Threshold+Bridge "Dark Souls 2 Threshold Bridge")** , and a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") under the stairs. You need high fire resistance to survive this. Take everything mentioned above into consideration when traveling through the lava. Head back up the stairs, and head over the bridge, ignoring the stairs on the right. Halfway across you can see a broken part of the floor to your right, leading down to several lava platforms. A corpse holding a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") glows in the distance, but you can come back later doused with water and with strong Fire DEF. An [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") will attack you from the other side of the bridge. This bridge is also a well known arena for [Dragon Remnants](/Dragon+Remnants "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Remnants") covenant.

Just before you enter the building, [Fencer Sharron](/Fencer+Sharron "Dark Souls 2 Fencer Sharron") will invade, there is also a chance that [Armorer Dennis](/Armorer+Dennis "Dark Souls 2 Armorer Dennis") invades. Through the door up the small set of stairs you will find more [Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") and a Flaming Bull Head emitting a continuous fire jet, blocking a corpse holding an [Iron Key ](/Iron+Key "Dark Souls 2 Iron Key"). To obtain this key:

  * Approach the corpse from the left side of the statue. Go very slowly and eventually you'll see the "pick up item" prompt.
  * Also, at just around 8-10 second intervals there's a short - very short - break in the fire, in which you can take a step or two forward to get the key.

Clear the enemies, ignore the stairs and move through the hall to your right. The merchant [Magerold of Lanafir ](/Magerold+of+Lanafir "Dark Souls 2 Magerold of Lanafir")will be ahead who can reduce your spells INT / FAITH requirement and as well as sells a [Fragrant Branch Of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+Of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch Of Yore"). Spend 10,000 souls with him to get a free [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring +1](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring").

### The Furnace

Start heading back out but take the stairway to your right in the hallway. At the top of the stairs, you'll find an [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") on the left, guarding a corpse hanging over a window with a [Pharros Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone"). Also in this room are Water Jars that can help with retrieving. To the right of the stairs is a small alcove which has an **Illusory Wall** -accessible as all others are, by pressing the "use" button on your respective controller. Inside is a ballista and a corpse holding 20x [Fire Arrow](/Fire+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Fire Arrow"), in the corner. Another **Illusory Wall** lies on the wall the ballista is aimed at. Activate the wall then quickly get on the ballista and use it to shoot the [Greatbow Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") waiting on the other side. The room ahead is the upper level of the Flaming Head Bull room. The stairs through the door to your left take you back there. To the right is the Furnace room, but for now head left downstairs to grab the [Iron Key](/Iron+Key "Dark Souls 2 Iron Key") out of the fire -if you haven't already- then, head back upstairs to continue on through the door enter the Furnace area.

Ahead of you on a walkway above is another [Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"), and a [Greatbow Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") on the bridge ahead, slightly out of reach. Move along the left and take out him out using ranged attacks, as he will just make things worse ahead. Another [Greatbow Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") lies far in the distance next to the fog door. If you can take him out from here as well, it would be beneficial. Continue on to find two more [Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"), and another [Greatbow Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") up a ladder that you can find at the end of this path. Up the ladder, you'll also find a chest containing a [Life Ring ](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") [+1](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") and a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"), while going to the bottom of the ladder, will grant you a [Soul Of A Proud Knight](/Soul+Of+A+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul Of A Proud Knight"), and [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder"). Head back to the level you started on and take the small stairs on the left.

There's a lever down here which you can pull to lower the walkway above. You can open the door here, but you won't be able to proceed in as a large flame shoots out, upon opening; roll out of the way as soon as possible. To progress, head up the stairs to find the closest walkway and travel on this newly accessible path. Head straight and kill the [Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") here, before jumping off to reach the other side of the Furnace Room. 

### Detour before the Demon

To your left is a Boss Fog door, but lets wait on this for a minute. Turn right look left to see a platform with a broken set of metal stairs. Jump over to it and at the edge is a corpse holding a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"), grab it then head inside and up the stairs. Climb up the ladder to reach the roof and a **Pharros Contraption** , and a chest containing a [Zweihander](/Zweihander "Dark Souls 2 Zweihander"). Activating the contraption spills out the infinite magical healing water. From the roof, jump down to the chest platform from earlier and head back over the jump towards the boss fog.

A corpse can be seen on the small ledge surrounding the pillar to your left. Angle your jump so you will roll towards the pillar wall and collect the [Large Soul Of Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and a [Red Leech Troches](/Red+Leech+Troches "Dark Souls 2 Red Leech Troches"). Drop down to the platform with the lever below. Pull the lever, Ignoring the door here as well. The catwalk above is now fully level. Drop down in front of the lever onto the metal stairs. At the bottom you'll find a chest on lava containing [Phoenix Parma](/Phoenix+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Phoenix Parma").

Head up the stairs and rotate the wheel located on the Main Furnace. This turns off the furnace making the two previously unsafe furnace doors, safe. Move along the right ledge to drop down to the furnace door. Inside, there is a ladder and a corpse holding 2x [Large Titanite Shard ](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard") and a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). Head up the ladder to reach a walkway with another ladder and a corpse holding an [Old Radiant Lifegem](/Old+Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Old Radiant Lifegem") and a [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"), on the far end. A [Captain](/alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 alonne Knight Captain") is also guarding this, if you didn't snipe him earlier. Head up the ladder, ignoring the doorways in front of you, and atop head left then drop down to the platform with the chest from earlier, containing the [Life Ring ](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") [+1](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") and [ Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). Move off the edge to the right and follow the pathway back to the boss fog door, you will also find [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah")'s summon sign a bit before the fog gate.

BOSS FIGHT: [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon")

### To the Belfry Sol Bonfire

After defeating the demon, move up the stairs. At the top, turn around to find a chest containing the [Porcine Shield](/Porcine+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Porcine Shield") and 5x [Flame Butterfly](/Flame+Butterfly "Dark Souls 2 Flame Butterfly"). Head forward to the **[Ironhearth Hall bonfire](/Ironhearth+Hall "Dark Souls 2 Ironhearth Hall")**. You can now head back downstairs to face the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer"), who will spawn in Smelter's arena (y _ou may have to fast travel away and come back to get him to spawn_). Defeating him grants you the [Ring Of Blades +1](/Ring+Of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring Of Blades").

Back at the bonfire open the door and defeat the [Captain](/alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 alonne Knight Captain") ahead before heading through the archway to the right. Up ahead there are two [Alonne Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"), an [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"), and not a lot of fighting space. Try to take them one at a time and be carefull, as the Ironclad Soldier will try to break pieces out of the bridge. Inside the larger room, there are another three [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"), a bunch of Flaming Bull Heads lining the walls and a few [Greatbow Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"), one of which is directly above you. Take him out with ranged attacks and pull the lever in front of you to treat two of the [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") ahead, to a glorious firey death. **Although it may seem tempting DO NOT pull it again as when the regular platform is present, you cannot reach a ladder and some chests on the far side**. To your left is a door with a **Pharros Contraption** that opens up a path to a ladder. Climb up to reach the **[Belfry Sol Approach bonfire](/Belfry+Sol+Approach "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol Approach")** and a chest containing [Thunder Quartz Ring +1](/Thunder+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Thunder Quartz Ring"). You can also reach [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") from here.

If you access this bonfire, you are forced to climb the ladder as there is no other way out except for warping. If you do not want to traverse [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol"), it is possible at the top of the ladder to fall back down while pushing forward, this places you on the ledge above the bonfire. Traveling to [Belfry](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") will eventually allow you to return to [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") via a small ledge above. On this ledge on the right wall is an **Illusory Wall** which opens up to a room holding two chests containing a [Black Knight Greatsword](/Black+Knight+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Black Knight Greatsword"), a [Protective Chime](/Protective+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Protective Chime"), and the [Grand Spirit Tree Shield](/Grand+Spirit+Tree+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Grand Spirit Tree Shield"). After looting, drop down and go back down the ladder into the lava-filled room with the flaming bull head's in the middle, where you first triggered the Pharros' Contraption to the **Belfry Sol bonfire**.

### Scortched Trails

Whether or not you went through Belfry Sol, from here, go up the stairs to the left and take out the [Greatbow Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") ahead, as well as the other one in the bottom left, from afar. A  **[Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard")** holding a [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard"), a [Titanite Chunk](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk") and a [Firedrake Stone](/Firedrake+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Firedrake Stone") can be found down the stairs to your left, be quick or lose it to the lava. Farther down the stairs are pressure plates that will activate a lava bucket trap, so be cautious whilst approaching the corpse ahead. Loot it to receive a [Large Soul Of Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight") and a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). Ahead is another lava path. Down and to the right is a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed"), and to the left, a chest at the end which contains the Pyromancy Spell: [Chaos Storm ](/Chaos+Storm "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Storm").

_This path is the hardest by far so only attempt this when you have at least Flash Sweat, +100 Total Fire DEF Armor, Small Orange Spurr, and Doused in water._

Back at the top, continue along the platforms, timing your movements between the Flaming Bull Head bursts and work your way to the left, to the platform with a corpse containing a [Large Soul Of Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). From here, turn around and head straight and shortly left is a ladder leading up. We will come back to this but for now head forwards to the opposite side of the room and take out the [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") by the fog door. Behind him is a corpse holding a [Large Soul Of Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and a [Monastery Charm](/Monastery+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Charm"). Turn around and head back to the ladder we passed before. Alternatively you can continue straight through the fog door but you will miss quite a few items. However, both paths eventually end in the same area so lets take the scenic route.

#### Scenic Route

Once up the ladder there are multiple Water urns, which are helpful for the lava path below. Up the stairs are two [Alonne Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") waiting for you, and at the far end of the path is a chest. Opening this chest will earn you 10x [Destructive Greatarrow](/Destructive+Greatarrow "Dark Souls 2 Destructive Greatarrow"), and an [Oliver The Collector](/Oliver+The+Collector "Dark Souls 2 Oliver The Collector") invasion. 

Up the ladder is another **Pharros Water Contraption**. Head up the stairway in this room to arrive to a roof with three [Alonne Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"). Be careful of the hole in the middle, and move along the left side to collect the [Simpleton's Spice](/Simpleton%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton%27s Spice"). There's also a chest on the right containing the [Black Knight Greataxe](/Black+Knight+Greataxe "Dark Souls 2 Black Knight Greataxe"). Now its time for the tedious trip down the hole in the middle. There are several walkways which you can fall onto. Be very careful, one wrong step and its a nice lava bath at the bottom. On the third walkway down, there's a corpse holding a [Cracked Red Eye Orb](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb") and a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). Soon you will drop down onto a beam in a room with a large lava pot below you. From the beam, carefully angle your fall so you land on the outer rim of the pot and circle around to the corpse inside which holds [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring"). From here drop down to the beam by your side. On this beam, you'll also have to take care of another [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"). Head forward and drop down onto the stairway platform to your left.

### Route to the King

The fog doorway directly ahead leads back to the original Flaming Bull Head room which brings us full circle. At the bottom of the stairs is a hallway with two [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") and a blade trap. This hallway eventually leads to a large caged area with Flaming Bull Heads. Time your movements and circle around the statues. You can see a corpse in between the flames, however grabbing this item will most likely result in your demise. The trick to looting this is to enter the flames right before they turn off, damaging you only slightly but giving you a bigger buffer of time. Then roll out. It's recommended to collect it on your return trip here; trust us, or you can find out why for yourself. 

To the left of the doorway ahead is a ladder leading up to a large caged room with more Flaming Bull Heads and another ladder directly in front on the far wall. You can either try to time it to run through the short breaks of fire, or you can hit it, which will make it start rotating, eitherway, get ready to run! Climb up to reach the **[Eygil's Idol bonfire](/Eygil%27s+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Eygil%27s Idol")** and a lever located up the small set of stairs which turns off all Flaming Bull Heads! Woohoo! Climb all the way back down into the first Flaming Head Room, loot the now accessible corpse to receive a cheeky [Lightning Short Bow +1](/Short+Bow "Dark Souls 2 Short Bow") and go through the doorway to the right of the ladder. Find a set of stairs leading down to another [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"), and a sign to summon [Manhunter O'Harrah](/Manhunter+O'Harrah "Dark Souls 2 Manhunter O'Harrah") on the right. Continue on to reach a very open lava area. You can see the Boss Fog Door in the distance. Move down the ramp way towards the stone stairs and get ready for battle.

BOSS FIGHT: [Old Iron King](/Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Old Iron King")

After defeating him move through the doorway located around the right corner and loot the chest for [Petrified Something](/Petrified+Something "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Something"). Move down the stairs and light the **Primal Bonfire**. In the room after the bonfire you will find an obelisk that will teleport you to the entrance of the [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King") DLC. After teleporting back to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), head to the giant Pit to reach the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints").

### Notes

  * In NG+, two red phantom [Alonne Knight Captains](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") will spawn in the Furnace.
  * On the platform you with the lever that you used to roast two of the [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"), with the use of long ranged attacks and some crafty timing to lure the enemies into the many traps in this room, including the lever-controlled platform, it is entirely possible to kill most if not all the enemies in the room standing on the platform with the lever, making navigation around the room that much easier. 

### Iron Keep Walkthrough

### Dealing with the Fire

  * To reach items along the lava paths in this level, you will need either max health or stack fire defense such as [Flash Sweat](/Flash+Sweat "Dark Souls 2 Flash Sweat") and the [Flame Quartz Ring](/Flame+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flame Quartz Ring") +2. 
    * High fire resist gear, [Dragon Tooth](/Dragon+tooth "Dark Souls 2 Dragon tooth") are useful too.
    * Consuming 3-6 [Radiant Lifegems](/Radiant+lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant lifegem") can help to maintain HP. 
    * The [small orange burr](/small+orange+burr "Dark Souls 2 small orange burr") is also not a bad idea either, however, burr doesn't stack with [Flash Sweat](/Flash+Sweat "Dark Souls 2 Flash Sweat"). Other 
    * [Flash Sweat](/Flash+sweat "Dark Souls 2 Flash sweat") provides +300 fire defense.
  * Rolling into one of the **urns** scattered across the map/**water pools** produced from the area's [Pharros' Contraption](/Pharros%27+Contraption "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Contraption") mechanisms will also increase fire defense by 400.
  * It appears a minimum fire defense of around 600 is needed to be able to reach any items.

  * Killing the [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon") will make his armor available from the armorer in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). This armor has one of the, if not the highest fire defenses in the game, proving useful in getting these items. The armor itself is not cheap but neither is anything of quality, and could be worth buying before attempting to get the items across the fire paths.
  * With 1000+ fire defense, You'll still take damage but it should be minimal.
  * A [Ring of Soul Protection](/Ring+of+Soul+protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Soul protection") or [Ring of Life Protection](/Ring+of+life+protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of life protection") will allow you to grab the items without penalty at lower defenses.
  * 797 fire defense allowed the hardest one to be reached (below the mimic) for instance, but did not provide enough time to exit. You will die after looting the chest but won't lose any souls or humanity if you were inclined to be human

### Mage Magerold

As you enter the area, head down the stairs on your left for the **[Threshold Bridge bonfire](/Threshold+Bridge "Dark Souls 2 Threshold Bridge")** , and a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") under the stairs. You need high fire resistance to survive this. Take everything mentioned above into consideration when traveling through the lava. Head back up the stairs, and head over the bridge, ignoring the stairs on the right. Halfway across you can see a broken part of the floor to your right, leading down to several lava platforms. A corpse holding a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") glows in the distance, but you can come back later doused with water and with strong Fire DEF. Two [Alonne Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") will attack you from the other side of the bridge. This bridge is also a well known arena for [Dragon Remnants](/Dragon+Remnants "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Remnants") covenant.

Through the door up the small set of stairs you will find two more [Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") and a Flaming Bull Head emitting a continuous fire jet, blocking a corpse holding an [Iron Key ](/Iron+Key "Dark Souls 2 Iron Key"). To obtain this key:

  * Approach the corpse from the left side of the statue. Go very slowly and eventually you'll see the "pick up item" prompt.
  * Also, at just around 8-10 second intervals there's a short - very short - break in the fire, in which you can take a step or two forward to get the key.

Clear the enemies, ignore the stairs and move through the hall to your right. The merchant [Magerold of Lanafir ](/Magerold+of+Lanafir "Dark Souls 2 Magerold of Lanafir")will be ahead who can reduce your spells INT / FAITH requirement and as well as sells a [Fragrant Branch Of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+Of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch Of Yore"). Spend 10,000 souls with him to get a free [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring +1](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring").

### The Furnace

Start heading back out but take the stairway to your right in the hallway. At the top of the stairs, you'll find an [Alonne Knight Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") on the left, guarding a corpse hanging over a window with a [Pharros Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone"). Also in this room are Water Jars that can help with retrieving. To the right of the stairs is a small alcove which has an **Illusory Wall** -accessible as all others are, by pressing the "use" button on your respective controller. Inside is a ballista and a corpse holding 20x [Fire Arrow](/Fire+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Fire Arrow"), in the corner.

Another **Illusory Wall** lies on the wall the ballista is aimed at. Activate the wall then quickly get on the ballista and use it to shoot the two [Alonne Knight Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") waiting on the other side. The room ahead is the upper level of the Flaming Head Bull room. The stairs through the door to your left take you back there. To the right is the Furnace room, but for now head left downstairs to grab the [Iron Key](/Iron+Key "Dark Souls 2 Iron Key") out of the fire -if you haven't already- then, head back upstairs to continue on through the door enter the Furnace area.

Ahead of you on a walkway above is another [Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"), and a [Greatbow Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") on the bridge ahead, slightly out of reach. Move along the left and take out him out using ranged attacks, as he will just make things worse ahead. Another [Greatbow Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") lies far in the distance next to the fog door. If you can take him out from here as well, it would be beneficial. Continue on to fight the [Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") ahead, and the other[Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") (top ledge) and a [Greatbow Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") (bottom ledge). Shoot them from here and the [Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") will engage when agro'ed. After taking care of them continue up a ladder that you can find at the end of this path. Up the ladder, you'll also find a chest containing a [Life Ring ](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") [+1](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") and a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"), while going to the bottom of the ladder, will grant you a [Soul Of A Proud Knight](/Soul+Of+A+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul Of A Proud Knight"), and [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder"). Head back to the level you started on and take the small stairs on the left.

There's a lever down here which you can pull to lower the walkway above. You can open the door here, but you won't be able to proceed in as a large flame shoots out, upon opening; if you do choose to open the door now, roll out of the way as soon as possible. To progress, head up the stairs to find the closest walkway and travel on this newly accessible path. Head straight and kill the [Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") here, before jumping off to reach the other side of the Furnace Room. 

### Detour before the Demon

To your left is a Boss Fog door, but lets wait on this for a minute. Turn right look left to see a platform with a broken set of metal stairs. Jump over to it and at the edge is a corpse holding a [Dull Ember](/Dull+Ember "Dark Souls 2 Dull Ember"), grab it then head inside and up the stairs. Climb up the ladder to reach the roof and a **Pharros Contraption** , and a chest containing a [Zweihander](/Zweihander "Dark Souls 2 Zweihander"). Activating the contraption spills out the infinite magical healing water. From the roof, jump down to the chest platform from earlier and head back over the jump towards the boss fog.

A corpse can be seen on the small ledge surrounding the pillar to your left. Angle your jump so you will roll towards the pillar wall and collect the [Large Soul Of Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and a [Red Leech Troches](/Red+Leech+Troches "Dark Souls 2 Red Leech Troches"). Drop down to the platform with the lever below. Pull the lever, Ignoring the door here as well. The catwalk above is now fully level. Drop down in front of the lever onto the metal stairs. At the bottom you'll find a chest on lava containing [Phoenix Parma Shield](/Phoenix+Parma+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Phoenix Parma Shield"). Head up the stairs and rotate the wheel located on the Main Furnace. This turns off the furnace making the two previously unsafe furnace doors, safe. Move along the right ledge to drop down to the furnace door. Inside, there is a ladder and a corpse holding 2x [Large Titanite Shard ](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard") and a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). Head up the ladder to reach a walkway with another ladder and a corpse holding an [Old Radiant Lifegem](/Old+Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Old Radiant Lifegem") and a [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"), on the far end.

A [Captain](/alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 alonne Knight Captain") is also guarding this, if you didn't snipe him earlier. Head up the ladder, ignoring the doorways in front of you, and atop head left then drop down to the platform with the chest from earlier, containing the [Life Ring ](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") [+1](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") and [ Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). Move off the edge to the right and follow the pathway back to the boss fog door. If you are in Human form, you can also summon [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah") on this same ledge.

BOSS FIGHT: [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon")

### To the Belfry Sol Bonfire

After defeating the demon, move up the stairs. At the top, turn around to find a chest containing the [Porcine Shield](/Porcine+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Porcine Shield") and 5x [Flame Butterfly](/Flame+Butterfly "Dark Souls 2 Flame Butterfly"). Head forward to the **[Ironhearth Hall bonfire](/Ironhearth+Hall "Dark Souls 2 Ironhearth Hall")**. You can now head back downstairs to face the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer"), who will spawn in Smelter's arena (y _ou may have to fast travel away and come back to get him to spawn_). Defeating him grants you the [Ring Of Blades +1](/Ring+Of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring Of Blades").

Back at the bonfire open the door and defeat the [Captain](/alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 alonne Knight Captain") ahead before heading through the archway to the right. Up ahead there are two [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"), and not a lot of fighting space. Try to take them one at a time. Inside the larger room, there are another three [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"), a bunch of Flaming Bull Heads lining the walls and a few [Greatbow Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"), one of which is directly above you. Take him out with ranged attacks and pull the lever in front of you to treat two of the [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") ahead, to a glorious firey death. **Although it may seem tempting DO NOT pull it again as when the regular platform is present, you cannot reach a ladder and some chests on the far side**. To your left is a door with a **Pharros Contraption** that opens up a path to a ladder. Climb up to reach the **[Belfry Sol Approach bonfire](/Belfry+Sol+Approach "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol Approach")** and a chest containing [Thunder Quartz Ring +1](/Thunder+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Thunder Quartz Ring"). You can also reach [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") from here.

If you access this bonfire, you are forced to climb the ladder as there is no other way out except for warping. If you do not want to traverse [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol"), it is possible at the top of the ladder to fall back down while pushing forward, this places you on the ledge above the bonfire. Traveling to [Belfry](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") will eventually allow you to return to [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") via a small ledge above. On this ledge on the right wall is an **Illusory Wall** which opens up to a room holding two chests containing a [Black Knight Greatsword](/Black+Knight+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Black Knight Greatsword"), a [Protective Chime](/Protective+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Protective Chime"), and the [Grand Spirit Tree Shield](/Grand+Spirit+Tree+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Grand Spirit Tree Shield"). After looting, drop down and go back down the ladder into the lava-filled room with the flaming bull head's in the middle, where you first triggered the Pharros' Contraption to the **Belfry Sol bonfire**.

### Scortched Trails

Whether or not you went through Belfry Sol, from here, go up the stairs to the left and take out the [Greatbow Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") ahead, as well as the other one in the bottom left, from afar. A  **[Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard")** holding a [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard"), a [Titanite Chunk](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk") and a [Firedrake Stone](/Firedrake+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Firedrake Stone") can be found down the stairs to your left, be quick or lose it to the lava. Farther down the stairs are black pressure plates that will activate a lava bucket trap, so be cautious whilst approaching the corpse and the [Greatbow Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") ahead. Loot the corpse to receive a [Large Soul Of Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight") and a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). Ahead is another lava path. Down and to the right is a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed"), and to the left, a chest at the end which contains the Pyromancy Spell: [Chaos Storm ](/Chaos+Storm "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Storm").

_This path is the hardest by far so only attempt this when you have at least Flash Sweat, +100 Total Fire DEF Armor, Small Orange Spurr, and Doused in water._

Back at the top, continue along the platforms, timing your movements between the Flaming Bull Head bursts and work your way to the left, to the platform with a corpse containing a [Large Soul Of Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). From here, turn around and head straight and shortly left is a ladder leading up. We will come back to this but for now head forwards to the opposite side of the room and take out the [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") by the fog door. Behind him is a corpse holding a [Large Soul Of Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and a [Monastery Charm](/Monastery+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Charm"). Turn around and head back to the ladder we passed before. Alternatively you can continue straight through the fog door but you will miss quite a few items. However, both paths eventually end in the same area so lets take the scenic route.

#### Scenic Route

Once up the ladder there are multiple Water urns, which are helpful for the lava path below. There is also a [mimic](/mimic "Dark Souls 2 mimic"). Kill it to obtain the [Dark Armor](/Dark+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Dark Armor"), and a [Lightning Winged Spear](/Winged+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Winged Spear"). Up the stairs, at the far end of the path is a chest. Opening this chest will earn you 10x [Destructive Greatarrow](/Destructive+Greatarrow "Dark Souls 2 Destructive Greatarrow").

Up the ladder is another **Pharros Water Contraption**. Head up the stairway in this room to arrive to a roof with three [Alonne Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"). Be careful of the hole in the middle, and move along the left side to collect the [Simpleton's Spice](/Simpleton%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton%27s Spice"). There's also a chest on the right containing the [Black Knight Greataxe](/Black+Knight+Greataxe "Dark Souls 2 Black Knight Greataxe"). Now its time for the tedious trip down the hole in the middle. 

There are several walkways which you can fall onto. Be very careful, one wrong step and its a nice lava bath at the bottom. On the third walkway down, there's a corpse holding a [Cracked Red Eye Orb](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb") and a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). Soon you will drop down onto a beam in a room with a large lava pot below you. From the beam, carefully angle your fall so you land on the outer rim of the pot and circle around to the corpse inside which holds [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring"). From here drop down to the beam by your side. On this beam, you'll also have to take care of another [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"). Head forward and drop down onto the stairway platform to your left.

### Route to the King

The fog doorway directly ahead leads back to the original Flaming Bull Head room which brings us full circle. At the bottom of the stairs is a hallway with two [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") and a blade trap. This hallway eventually leads to a large caged area with Flaming Bull Heads. Time your movements and circle around the statues. You can see a corpse in between the flames, however grabbing this item will most likely result in your demise. The trick to looting this is to enter the flames right before they turn off, damaging you only slightly but giving you a bigger buffer of time. Then roll out. It's recommended to collect it on your return trip here; trust us, or you can find out why for yourself. 

To the left of the doorway ahead is a ladder leading up to a large caged room with another ladder directly in front on the far wall. Climb up to reach the **[Eygil's Idol bonfire](/Eygil%27s+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Eygil%27s Idol")** and a lever located up the small set of stairs which turns off all Flaming Bull Heads! Woohoo! Climb all the way back down into the first Flaming Head Room, loot the now accessible corpse to receive a cheeky [Lightning Short Bow +1](/Short+Bow "Dark Souls 2 Short Bow") and go through the doorway to the right of the ladder. Find a set of stairs leading down to another [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"). Continue on to reach a very open lava area. You can see the Boss Fog Door in the distance. Move down the ramp way towards the stone stairs and get ready for battle.

BOSS FIGHT: [Old Iron King](/Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Old Iron King")

After defeating him move through the doorway located around the right corner and loot the chest for [Sublime Bone Dust](/Sublime+Bone+Dust "Dark Souls 2 Sublime Bone Dust"). Move down the stairs and light the **Primal Bonfire**. In the room after the bonfire you will find an obelisk that will teleport you to the entrance of the [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King") DLC.
