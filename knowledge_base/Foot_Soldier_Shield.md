**Foot Soldier Shield** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing. 

     _"A small shield used by Drangleic foot soldiers._

     _A clearly makeshift shield that does not offer significant defense._
     _The only advantage of this shield is that it makes parrying easier."_
