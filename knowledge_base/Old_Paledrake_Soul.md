### Dark Souls 2 Old Paledrake Soul Hints and Tips

  * It might be wiser to pick Crystal Soul Spear because the Moonlight Greatsword has been patched and has lower stats and attacking rate
  * Also, the Crystal Soul Spear is required for the Master of Sorcery achievement/Trophy, while the Moonlight Greatsword doesn't count toward any achievements/Trophies

### Old Paledrake Soul Lore in Dark Souls 2

There are a number of clues given in game that the soul belongs to Seath, despite his name not being mentioned.

  * This appears to be what is left of the great soul belonging to [Seath the Scaleless](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Seath+the+Scaleless "Dark Souls 2 Seath the Scaleless").
  * It's used to acquire the Moonlight Greatsword, which needed to be cut from Seath's tail in the first game.
  * 'Paledrake' meaning 'White Dragon'.
  * Also, Seath studied and resided at The Duke's Archives, which resembles the personal archives of the Duke of Tseldora. The miners of Brightstone Cove may even have excavated the crystals of the former Crystal Caves.
  * Manscorpion Tark will give you a [Second Dragon Ring](/Second+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Second Dragon Ring") for killing his master after you kill Freja, but will tell you that his master cannot really be killed, but will change form so he may "seethe" for all eternity. This is likely a play on words.
  * Duke Tseldora went mad, just like Seath, and became fixated on his obsession. Seath's soul was probably possessing or manipulating him.
  * Sweet Shalquoir also mentions after defeating Freja that she recalls a similar story of a duke driven mad, a being long ago that drove himself mad searching for what he could not attain, a possible reference to Seath's hunt for the scales of immortality
  * Remember this is all theory and there is no solid evidence that this game takes place in the same geographical area as the first. It's likely that the two kingdoms are parallels, enforcing the inevitable cycle that fate has upon the cursed peoples. The lore of Dark Souls is deliberately shrouded and fragmented to allow the player to form their own opinions. Unless explicitly stated, there is no "right" answer.
