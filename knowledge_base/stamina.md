**Stamina** is a resource that determines what actions you can perform before exhaustion. It is represented on the HUD in the upper left corner, by a green bar directly beneath your [HP](/HP "Dark Souls 2 HP"). 

  * [Endurance](/Endurance "Dark Souls 2 Endurance") (END) is the primary attribute stat that determines your maximum stamina.
  * Maximum stamina can also be increased by wearing the [First](/First+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 First Dragon Ring"), [Second](/Second+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Second Dragon Ring"), or [Third Dragon Ring](/Third+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Third Dragon Ring").

###  Stamina Consumption

Stamina is drained by performing most actions, including attacking, casting a spell, blocking an attack, sprinting, rolling, or jumping.

  * The amount of stamina drained when attempting to block incoming attacks is determined by your equipment's stability. The higher your stability, the less stamina is drained.
  * Thrown items (consumables like throwing knives or firebombs) do not consume stamina or impede its regeneration.

###  Stamina Regeneration

**Stamina regeneration** is determined in a mostly linear fashion by your [equipment load](/equipment+load "Dark Souls 2 equipment load") percentage (the higher your percentage, the greater the penalty upon your base stamina regeneration).

  * Blocking greatly slows stamina regeneration.
  * Standing with a bow drawn will pause stamina regeneration all together.
  * The base rate of stamina regeneration (0.0% equipment load) is 51.9 points/second.
  * There are no set tiers for stamina regeneration in relation to equipment load percentage, but penalties are more significant in the 30-70% range (the slope of the formula increases).

    
    
    | Equipment Load Percentage | Penalty | Stamina Regeneration |
