**Basilisk** is an [enemy](/enemies "Dark Souls 2 enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. Frog-like creatures known as **Basilisks** cast the petrify effect on players using a fog-breath attack, posing minimal danger otherwise. In Shaded Woods and Aldia's Keep, default Basilisks can be found in caves and trapped inside carriages. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Basilisk Information in Dark Souls 2

Frog-like creatures that cast the petrify effect on players by using a fog-breath attack, otherwise offer very little danger. A giant, and much more formidable, version will attack the player more directly. Unlike in Dark Souls, these enemies can inflict physical damage with a leaping attack.   
  
In [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") and [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep"), default Basilisk can be found in caves and trapped inside carriages.   
  
In [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") there is a subspecies of Basilisk (a.k.a. Sand Basilisk) whose bulbous false eyes have completely atrophied as an adaptation to living in desert environments. This variant still attacks with petrifying breath but has also learned to burrow under the sand, enabling it to ambush its prey and travel undetected.   
  
In [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") and [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep"), there is a subspecies of Basilisk (a.k.a. Great Basilisk) whose the size is five times larger than normal basilisk and green skin tone whick makes them look like an enlarged treefrog, the range of the mist is much wider, and the melee attack can even break the cages.

### Basilisk Strategy Tips in DS2

  * Wear [Ash Knuckle Ring](/Ash+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Ash Knuckle Ring") or use [Triclops Snake Troches](/Triclops+Snake+Troches "Dark Souls 2 Triclops Snake Troches") to raise petrification resistance
  * Wear [Ring of Life Protection](/Ring+of+Life+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Life Protection") to eliminate the need of [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") even after being petrified.
  * Or wear [Ring of Soul Protection](/Ring+of+Soul+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Soul Protection") to be completely immune to petrification

### Dark Souls 2 Basilisk Move Set

  * Petrification Mist - it emits a mist which can petrify the target
  * Melee attack - unlike their Dark Souls 1 counterpart, they can actually use melee attack
  * Digging - the variant with smaller eyes can dig into the ground for dodging attack or hiding, approach them to lure them out

### Basilisk Notes in Dark Souls 2

  * Basilisks are a great way to farm infusion stones, since they can drop each of them (except for [Palestones](/Palestone "Dark Souls 2 Palestone"), which removes an infusion)
  * Defeated Basilisks will subtract 9 or 12 seconds from the duration of a co-op session. See [Online](/Online "Dark Souls 2 Online") for more detailed information about Multiplayer Time Limits.
