**Key to the Embedded** is a Keyblade in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. It acts as a **[Key](/Keys "Dark Souls 2 Keys")** but is classified as a Weapon. **Key to the Embedded** in Dark Souls 2 is a unique Keyblade obtained by defeating the [Demon of Song](/Demon+of+Song "Dark Souls 2 Demon of Song"). This Keyblade has notable uses, such as opening the cage where the Milfanito in green was trapped in Drangleic Castle. It triggers various rewards by interacting with different Milfanito characters throughout the game. However, using the key to unlock the door results in its disappearance from the inventory. [Key Items](/Keys "Dark Souls 2 Keys") are found in specific locations or are given by a related [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") which are used to unlock areas, quests, diversify the inventories of [Merchants](/Merchants "Dark Souls 2 Merchants") and to further progress the game's story.

> Sword that opens the Embedded's door. Shaped like a weapon, but is in fact a key. Plunge the key into the Embedded to bring a rhapsodic end to his fate. The once-human Embedded, realizing that he could never resist the temptation of the flesh, bound himself eternally with chains. Since then, he has awaited the day that somebody will find this key, and bury it within his bosom.

  * If a Bonfire Ascetic is used to fight the Demon of Song in NG, additional keys will drop, unless a key is already in your inventory - you can only have one key at a time.
  * During the unlocking animation, the key will appear, as if from your inventory, even if you're already holding the key, and appears normal even if it's buffed or broken.
  * As of patch 1.06, the attack power and scaling of this weapon have been buffed, but be aware that you can not upgrade it or infuse it.
  * Has the highest counter damage of any greatsword and is also incredibly light.
  * Extremely handy if combined with [Ring of Blades](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades") and [Old Leo Ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring").
  * Although the description states that you bury the key within his bosom (chest), you push the key into his face.
