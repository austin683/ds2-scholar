A **Riposte** in **Dark Souls 2** is the name of the attack that is able to be delivered after an enemy has been [parried](/Parry "Dark Souls 2 Parry") and knocked into a prone state.

### Dark Souls 2 How to Riposte

  * In order to riposte, approach the prone and vulnerable target and attack. The player has to be close, otherwise the riposte may not trigger. Some enemies can't be parried, and some enemies that can be parried can't be riposted.
  * Players executing a riposte will take heavily reduced damage while locked in the animation.
  * A guardbroken enemy can also have a riposte executed on them. In order to guardbreak an enemy, the player must move forward and light attack at the same time into a blocking enemy. Players can also be guardbroken when their [stamina](/Stamina "Dark Souls 2 Stamina") is completely depleted while blocking with a [shield](/Shields "Dark Souls 2 Shields") or two-handed [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons").
