_"King Vendrick called upon powers from beyond his borders in an attempt to stave off the curse. Perhaps they belonged to one of his guests."_

### Location

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite.](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")
  * Grants +2 ADP.
  * You will have to join the [Bell Keepers](/Bell+Keepers "Dark Souls 2 Bell Keepers") covenant and kill the [Mad Warrior](/Mad+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Mad Warrior") numerous times in order to obtain this set and his [blade](/Berserker+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Berserker Blade").
