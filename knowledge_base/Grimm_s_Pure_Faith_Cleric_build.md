#  Grimm's Pure Faith Cleric build

  
Starting Class - Cleric, Soul Level 120   
  
Weapon: Lightning Mace +10, Lightning Dragon Chime +5,   
  
Armor: +10 Insolent armor set (grants additional 2 faith bonus and mobility due to being a lighter armor with good defense)   
  
Rings: Third Dragon Ring, Cloranthy Ring +2, Ring Of Prayer, Southern Ritual Band +2   
  
Miracles: 1x Sacred Oath, 2x Sunlight Blade, Wrath Of The Gods, Great Sunlight Spear   
  
Stats:   
  
Vigor - 40   
  
End - 20   
  
Vit - 8   
  
Att - 30   
  
Strength - 12   
  
Dex - 5   
  
Adp - 4   
  
Int - 4   
  
Faith - 50   
  
Note: You'll have full mobility, modest armor defense, 57 faith and premium faith scaling in casting with 7 total slots with enough health. Minor alterations in dropping vigor to 30 and using 10 of those points towards end, or distributing them amongst adp and vit, will make you a powerful PVP tank with full mobility who happens to be a miracle wrecking machine.
