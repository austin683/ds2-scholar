**Shield of the Insolent** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"The shield of formerly high-ranking clerics. The effects of a blessing are still with it, and the shield recovers one's stamina._

     _The clerics held venerated positions once, but now, their souls wander aimlessly in the depths of a murky darkness._

     _Effect: stamina recovery"_
