**Faraam Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

     _"Helmet/Armor/Gauntlets/Boots worn by the Forossa Lion Knights._

     _The mighty Lion Knights, worshippers of the war god Faraam, wore heavy armor and were feared for their nimble two-handed swordplay._

     _But their legacy was cut short with the fall of Forossa."_

###  Set Location

  * Found in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"), next to [King's Gate](/King%27s+Gate "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Gate") bonfire: enter the hall with six sealed doors and kill [Stone Soldiers](/Stone+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Stone Soldier") next to the door on far left ([Ruin Sentinel](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") will be behind it). Drop into the hole (Ruin Sentinel is likely to follow you if not killed) to find the set, a [Darkdweller](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller"), and another bonfire.
  * Also dropped by dark spirit [Faraam Knight ](/Dual+Avelyn+Faraam "Dark Souls 2 Dual Avelyn Faraam") (not guaranteed) in [Frigid Outskirts](/Frigid+Outskirts "Dark Souls 2 Frigid Outskirts") on NG+.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * This is the poster armor seen in both the cover of the game and in the first trailer 'Of Masks and Dragons.'
  * Namco Bandai Games asked armor specialists Armedia to recreate this armor set, which has been shown at EuroGamer Expo in London, UK in the dates of September 26-29, 2013.
  * The Collector's Edition includes a 30 cm statue of a warrior wearing Faraam set and wielding two swords. This statue has a bit more detail than in-game armor: there's a pattern on the side of helm's crest.
