**Gyrm Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Helm/Armor/Gloves/Boots of the nomadic Gyrm. Excellent poise but heavy.  
>   
> The stocky Gyrm are kind-natured, but humans deemed them impure, and drove them underground.

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Gyrm Worker](/Gyrm+Worker "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Worker") in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") (one, next to Old Akelarre bonfire) and in [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros").

  * While a bit inferior in physical defenses, Gyrm helm is better than normal [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior+Set "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior Set") helm in all other stats and weighs a bit less.
  * Compared to [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior+Set "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior Set") Greathelm, Gyrm helm is almost equal in elemental defenses and better at resisting most status effects while offering ~10% lower physical protection.
