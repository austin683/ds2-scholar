**Hunter Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> A leather hat with a large brim. Traditionally used by bow hunters.  
>   
> The hunting goddess Evlana was no Goddess at all, but rather a brave and highly skilled bow huntress. Long after her demise, the passing of lore transformed her into a deity.  
>   
> Armor made from soft leather. A commonplace piece of armor.  
> Few embellishments. Lightweight and easy to use.  
>   
> Gloves/Boots made from soft leather. A commonplace piece of armor.  
> These gloves/boots are favored by hunters due to their light weight.

###  Set Location

  * Found in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"), in a chest next to Soldier's Rest bonfire. 
    * Try not to lead the local population of [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") there, as the chest is made of wood and will break, leaving only rubbish.
    * [Soldier Key](/Soldiers+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldiers Key") is required to access this area.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Unlike _Dark Souls_ version, both male and female variants of the hat have pointed tips.
