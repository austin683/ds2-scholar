**Cragslipper (Razorback Nightcrawler)** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.   

  

  

_This giant millipede is found only in Black Gulch. In contrast to the artificial creatures roaming The Gutter, the Razorback Nightcrawler is a product of an undisturbed evolution. They are more capable of crushing a careless passerby with their great weight and tremendous power_   
Enormous, many-eyed worm monsters that crawl from their hole-lairs in the walls of Black Gulch. Because they cannot completely leave their lairs, they are unable to chase the player and have a limited attack range. They can safely be hit with ranged attacks, but have high health. 

  
  
  

###  Strategy tips
