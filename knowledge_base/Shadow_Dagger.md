**Shadow Dagger** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Shadow Dagger** excels in agile and bleeding-focused combat. Inflicting bleed damage adds an extra layer of threat to your foes. With a focus on backstabbing and ripostes, this dagger stands out for its high critical modifier and quick initiation animation making it especially effective against foes vulnerable to such tactics, such as the [Lion Clan Warrior](/Lion+Clan+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Clan Warrior"). 

> Dagger used by those who lurk in the shadows. Formed by bending a sword into the shape of a dagger.  
> In Mirrah, the land of knights, there exists an order of shadow knights who carry out assassinations in the cover of darkness.  
>   
> Those who fled even the order of shadow knights had rejected all forms of honor, and resorted to unseemly mercenary work.

### How to get Shadow Dagger in Dark Souls 2

  * Dropped from the Suspicious Shadows enemy who only appear in [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man%27s Wharf"), in the [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry") arena, in NG+ and beyond.
  * To farm them, kill them during the boss fight but do not kill the boss. Let the boss kill you or warp back to the bonfire to try again. (They respawn indefinitely if you save/quit)

  
**Scholar of the First Sin:**

  * Dropped from any [Suspicious Shadow](/Nimble+Shadow "Dark Souls 2 Nimble Shadow") you encounter (No-Man's Wharf, Lost Bastille, and etc.) through the game.
  * To easily farm this dagger (Alongside Malformed Claw and Shadow Set), simply join the [Company Of Champions](/Company+of+Champions "Dark Souls 2 Company of Champions") to keep enemies from de-spawning, go to The Upper Earthen Peak bonfire then head downstairs. A Suspicious Shadow jumps down (There's a Desert Sorceress there too). You can equip [Watchdragon Parma](/Watchdragon+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Watchdragon Parma"), [Jester's Cap](/Jester%27s+Cap "Dark Souls 2 Jester%27s Cap"), [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring") and use [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin") to raise item discovery.

### DS2 Shadow Dagger Hints and Tips

  * As a strength based dagger, this weapon is excellent as a backup weapon for strength based characters, as it weighs very little and can be used to punish backstab fishers. It's also better at backstabbing in general, since the initiating animation for backstabbing is much quicker.
  * A backstab / riposte dedicated dagger due to its high critical modifier and backstab speed, extremely useful on wiping out [Lion Clan Warriors](/Lion+Clan+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Clan Warrior"), who're extremely vulnerable to backstabbing.
