**Benhart's boots** is a **legging** and a part of [Benhart's Set](/Benhart's+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Benhart's boots Description

_"Armor of unknown origin. Belonged to Benhart of Jugo. Apparently Benhart found this while wandering land to land, but its origins are unknown. He wore it all the time, he adored it so, leaving a slight odor.__"_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Complete Benhart's achievement, "Moonlight Greatsword" by successfully defeating three bosses with him, then speak to him in the [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro).
  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia) upon Benhart's death.

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite)
  * The family crest is same as [Creighton's Set](/Creighton%27s+Set), while Creighton's Set is a replica of Mirrah's armor and the replica's description stated the origin of the crest, Benhart found this while traveling outdoor, this is believed to be the true Mirrah's armor.
  * Benhart spoke out his homeland was in the far east, probably referred to Mirrah, perhaps he's actually a Knight of Mirrah, or a person struggling to find his origin, or, he's a part of the memory.
