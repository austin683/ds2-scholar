#  Lunatic Luna, The Bluemoon Blademaster

Author: [Marcohazard](https://www.youtube.com/user/Marcohazard) (PSN: Mhazard)   
I brought a build from the distinct land of Jugo, the lunatic art of the moon, by wielding the true [Moonlight Greatsword](/Moonlight+Greatsword) and Bernhart's [false sword](/BlueMoon+Greatsword) at the same time. it'll crush your foes with a painful magic damage.   
feel free to leave comments at the comment section below, tell me whether it's cute or not :3

##  Introduction:

  
  
It is believed the blade possessed the power of the moon, the one on the right is the true blade, while the one on the left seemed to be lifeless, it, however, is the symbol of friendship, inherited from Benhart, as well as the clothing of the residents in Jugo, it posseses all the enchanting items to catch people off guard, while the dual blades' strong attack can hit the foes hard, approximately 812 damage, with the cost of huge stamina comsumption.

###  Description:

This is an omnibuild which all equipments can be swapped in any situation, works on both casters or light weapon based classes, but this one simply puts the impossible act of dual wielding Moonlight Greatsword and Bluemoon Greatsword to be possible while maintaining the light weight, since you cannot fires the beam by power stancing, I replaced Moonlight Greatsword with Bluemoon Greatsword for the left hand weapon. the result is, it inflicts 812 damage per power stance heavy slash, it's still possible to launch the beam, Brace Knuckle Ring +2 will prevent the blade from breaking, to reload, use the Repair spell shown above, Dark Hail is much of a PvE spell stored in case of emergency usage, you may replace them with other spells you want.   
  
as for PvP Variant of this build, it also has Dual Poison [Channeler's Tridents](/Channeler%27s+Trident) which can inflict poison **INSTANTLY**   
  
[Desert Sorceress Set](/Desert+Sorceress+Set) is a must for this build due to its insanely light weight and elemental defense, it does have a good petrification resistance.
