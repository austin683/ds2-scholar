**Royal Dirk** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Royal Dirk** primarily scales with both [Strength](/Strength "Dark Souls 2 Strength") and [Dexterity](/Dexterity "Dark Souls 2 Dexterity"). Known for its versatility in slash and thrust attacks, it offers a balanced approach between physical and elemental damage

> A dagger fashioned from rare geisteel, boasting an unusually long blade.  
>   
> Geisteel was a precious alloy created in the eastern land of Mirrah, its composition long kept secret from foreign lands.  
>   
> That is, until Chancellor Wellager was ordered by King Vendrick to grant the gifted blacksmith Llewellyn a lifetime contract, whatever the cost, in order to introduce the rare alloy to Drangleic.

### 

###  **Acquired From**

  * Gift from [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") after defeating the [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord") boss. You must visit and talk to him. He will give you this weapon along with an [Espada Ropera](/Espada+Ropera "Dark Souls 2 Espada Ropera")

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Reinforced with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5
  * This dagger features a long blade, and was originally carried by [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager").
  * Despite the game labeling it as a dagger, the 1H moveset is the same as some straight swords, however the 2H moveset gives the weapon the generic Dagger moveset. (Similar to the [Black Flamestone Dagger](/Black+Flamestone+Dagger "Dark Souls 2 Black Flamestone Dagger"))
  * Consequently, due to the weapon being a mixture of a straight sword and dagger, the backstab and riposte animations are that of a straight sword, and therefore lack the damage of normal daggers on those animations.
  * Alternatively, you can wield [Espada Ropera](/Espada+Ropera "Dark Souls 2 Espada Ropera") on the right hand to replicate the "Rapier & Dagger" style.
