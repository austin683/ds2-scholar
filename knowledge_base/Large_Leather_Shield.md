**Large Leather Shield** is a [standard shield](/standard+shields "Dark Souls 2 standard shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A leather-covered shield. Preferred by hunters._

     _Inferior to metal shields in terms of stability and physical damage reduction,  
but easy to use and weighing so little that it hardly requires any strength to bear."_

### Acquired From:

  * [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"): On a corpse in the stairwell in the room with the crystal lizard, before the elevator down to the Last Giant.

### Large Leather Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Nice early-game shield which offers good all-round protection and decent stability for it's low weight. Not ideal for a tank-build but very useful for occasional shield-users which relies more on dodging or parrying.
  * This shield has appeared in both _[Dark Souls](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Large+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Large Leather Shield")_ and _[Dark Souls 3](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Large+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Large Leather Shield")_.
