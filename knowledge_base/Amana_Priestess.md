### Amana Priestess Information in Dark Souls 2

_Hollowed priestesses formerly responsible for performing the sealing rituals which imprisoned the Demon of Song.  
Over time the line of shrine maidens gradually died off and, with no successors to pass down the sacred rites, the seal broke and Demon was freed from its prison._   
  
These female sorcerers cast Homing Soul Arrow at you. They have an extremely large aggro range and the spell will track you over large distances. They are able to lock onto and attack you from maximum view range with powerful, fast, homing soul arrows. In melee combat they use their staffs in wide sweeps in front of them. **Note:** Since patch 1.03, the homing soul arrows don't home in as they used to (now you just need to move left or right) and do slightly less damage.   
  
**Note:** An interesting variant is a healer Priestess who heals everyone around her when she is hurt or her allies are damaged. Has no offensive attacks or spells. One appears in NG, just before [Rhoy's Resting Place bonfire](/Rhoy%27s+Resting+Place "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy%27s Resting Place") (3rd bonfire), hiding behind the two [Archdrake Pilgrims](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") at the cave entrance. One appears just after the bonfire.

More come out in NG+.

### DS2 Amana Priestess Strategy Tips

  * Extreme caution and a bow or crossbow are highly recommended to fight these enemies with any amount of ease. Use of cover, identification, and rolling side ways to dodge their arrows all help, but fighting them in melee is suicide for the inexperienced. [Alluring Skulls](/Alluring+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Alluring Skull") or [Yearn](/Yearn "Dark Souls 2 Yearn") may work to pull them off you for a minute or two. [Magic Shield](/Magic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Magic Shield") can block their magic completely.

  * Roll through the soul arrow toward her, gaining ground while avoiding damage.

### DS2 Amana Priestess Notes & Tips

  * They do not recover when knocked to the ground by a Greathammer 2H strong attack.  
They also do not recover with the [Darkstorm](/Darkstorm "Dark Souls 2 Darkstorm") spell. (This has been proven false on the OG DS2 as it's the [Leydia Pyromancer](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") that does this instead)
  * Defeated Amana Shrine Maidens will subtract 36 seconds from the length of a co-op session. See [Online](/Online "Dark Souls 2 Online") for more detailed information about Multiplayer Time Limits.
