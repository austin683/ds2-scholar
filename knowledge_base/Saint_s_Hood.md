**Saint's Hood** is a [Helm](/Helms "Dark Souls 2 Helms") in Dark Souls 2.

_"__Hood worn by miracle-casting clerics. Grants slight increase to spell uses. Belonged to Licia of Lindelt._

_Lindelt is founded upon stringent commandments. Its inhabitants often travel to distant lands for ascetic training,  
but more than a few of these trainees liberate themselves from Lindelt's teachings in the process._

_Effect: Increases number of casts for each spell."_

### Location

  * Received from [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt") when talking to her with 30 Faith. (Faith gained from stat-boosting gear and rings does not count toward the 30 faith requirement, only level ups).
  * Can be purchased from [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") for 3600 souls after killing [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt") without completing her quest.
  * Obtained alongside the rest of her set and the [Soothing Sunlight](/Soothing+Sunlight "Dark Souls 2 Soothing Sunlight") Miracle upon completion of her quest
