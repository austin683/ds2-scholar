### DKS2 The Graverobber, Varg, and Cerah Strategy

Below the main level of the arena lies a flooded chamber containing numerous statues and Corrosive Crawlers. While the water hinders your movement speed and the cramped quarters make combat difficult, this area is essential for kiting the trio. To exit, head to the left side of the chamber (relative to the fog gate entrance) to find a ramp leading back to the upper platforms.

Phantoms can split the enemy's attention, effectively dividing the encounter into a series of manageable 1v1 duels.

#### Solo Strategy

**"Afficted Graverober"** moves with the highest speed of all three and usually attacks first before Varg and Cerah. Use this to your advantage and attempt to deal damage to her before her allies can arrive. Use parrying and backstabbing to deal a significant amount of damage without the need to expose yourself to Varg's and Cerah's counterattacks due to the resistance given during the execution of the critical hit. Be wary of her quick attacks; they deal significant chip damage and can leave you open to Varg's heavy overheads or Cerah's ranged support.

"**Ancient Soldier Varg** " has the highest health pool, noticeably high poise, high damage with his hammer, but also the slowest movement speed of all three. Avoid trading hits or overextending; instead, capitalize on his slow pace to eliminate the Graverobber and Cerah first. Once isolated, backstabbing is the most effective strategy, as parrying his heavy attacks is high-risk. Note that Varg has high Lightning resistance, so physical or other elemental damage is preferred if using reach weapons like spears.

"**Cerah the Old Explorer** " provides ranged support with a Greatbow but will switch to an Estoc for quick thrusts and slashes if engaged at close range. The most effective strategy is to eliminate the Graverobber first, then focus on Cerah while Varg is distanced. Cerah has the lowest health and poise of the trio, making him highly susceptible to being staggered or parried. To avoid Greatarrow fire, utilize the environment for cover, lure the trio into the water to slow their advance, or time your rolls through the projectiles. 

#### Hexer Dark Fog Strategy

For players struggling with this encounter, Dark Fog is highly effective. Equip two copies (or one, if you can consistently hit them with few casts) and use a Dark Sunset Staff +5 for maximum effectiveness. Kite the bosses around the arena, allowing the poison to deplete their health. You can supplement this damage with occasional Dark Orbs while staying mobile.
