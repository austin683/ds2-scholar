## The Pit

**The Pit** is a [Location](/Locations "Dark Souls 2 Locations") in **Dark Souls 2** in the middle of [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). This deep foreboding hole leads to an enormous cavernous labyrinths deep underground, including [The Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") and [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter") (which in turn leads to [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch")). The fall distances involved in descending The Pit are so extreme as to be unviable without the aid of fall damage protection such as the [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") (sold by [Sweet Shalquoir](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir"), the cat merchant in the Majula shop near The Pit's surface entrance) or the [Fall Control](/Fall+Control "Dark Souls 2 Fall Control") spell, or a ladder placed by [Laddersmith Gilligan](/Laddersmith+Gilligan "Dark Souls 2 Laddersmith Gilligan"),

  * The [Fall Control](/Fall+Control "Dark Souls 2 Fall Control") spell will cancel fall damage entirely for a fall from a non-deadly height, but falling from a deadly height will still kill you.

## Journeying In The Pit

### Surviving the Fall

  * You need at least 1346 HP or the [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring"), which is purchasable from [Sweet Shalquoir](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir") for about 13,400 souls. While this may sound like a lot, especially early game, it is necessary to survive the initial drop.
  * Stock up on [Estus Flasks](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask"). The drops, especially the first, will still take a chunk of health. Make sure to refill your health before every drop.
  * **Fall Damage Reduction Equipment** : [Lion Warrior Cuffs](/Lion+Warrior+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lion Warrior Set"), [Flying Feline Boots](/Flying+Feline+Boots "Dark Souls 2 Flying Feline Boots"), [Jester's Tights](/Jester's+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Jester's Armor"). All these items and the ring can be worn together to greatly reduce fall damage. If you unequip all weapons and any armor that does not reduce fall damage, it will also lessen the amount of fall damage taken. 
  * To reach the Forgotten Door in The Pit which has a visible ladder leading to it, the player must drop down in a particular path that involves a harsher drop than otherwise. Using the platforms to strategically fall shorter distances will put the player onto platforms that leave no path to safely jump to the the ladder that leads to the door.
  * Do not jump on the thin narrow fastened beams that look to be of questionable physical integrity to support the impact of a falling human-sized body.

### Ladder Down

Alternatively, another way to descend the pit is to purchase a ladder from [Laddersmith Gilligan](/Laddersmith+Gilligan "Dark Souls 2 Laddersmith Gilligan"). He offers three ladders, each more expensive than the last. 

  * The cheapest ladder will only go half way down to the first plank, but it could be all you need if you have high health and/or the [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring").
  * The second most expensive ladder will take you down to near the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") entrance. From there, you can drop down a few more levels to a platform just outside the bonfire at the start of the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints"). Be advised that you will still need a lot of HP and/or the [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") (or other fall damage reduction items) to reach the entrance. A separate "drop path" will put you on a different platform at the bottom of a ladder.
  * The most expensive ladder gives you easy access to the Forgotten Door, far down in the pit. The [key](/Forgotten+Key "Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Key") to the door is found in a hidden cave in the [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch"); see the next section for instructions on how to attain it.
  * Continuing to drop down from the bottom of the ladder will put you on yet another ledge which meets up with the [Wooden Bridge section of the Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints#WoodenBridgeToTheGutter "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints#WoodenBridgeToTheGutter"), which eventually leads to [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter").

### Opening the Forgotten Door

The key to The Pit's Forgotten Door must be obtained in [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch"). Proceed out from the Black Gulch Mouth bonfire past the poison statues, several black oil pools, and giant cave worm/bugs that emerge from the holes in the wall. Drop down the ledge (use a torch for visibility) in front of the second giant worm and you'll find a locked door. To gain the key, drop further down the ledges and go down the tunnel to find two giants (there will be at least two; if you've summoned an NPC or another player, there will be more).

The giants will drop the [Forgotten Key](/Forgotten+Key "Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Key") which opens the Forgotten Door in [the pit](/the+pit "Dark Souls 2 the pit"), and also opens the locked door on the ledge on the route to where the Forgotten Key was found in Black Gulch. Behind The Forgotten Door are there are 3 chests containing [Great Lightning Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear"), [Witchtree Branch](/Witchtree+Branch "Dark Souls 2 Witchtree Branch"), [Witchtree Bellvine](/Witchtree+Bellvine "Dark Souls 2 Witchtree Bellvine"), and [Soul Vortex](/Soul+Vortex "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vortex"), and a body holding the [Dragon Talon](/Dragon+Talon "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Talon").
