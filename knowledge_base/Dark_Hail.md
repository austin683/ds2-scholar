**Dark Hail** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> "A Hex modified from an old sorcery by Gilleah the Hexer.  
> Fires several orbs of darkness.  
> Hexing is both rooted in sorcery and miracles, but is viewed as a perilous affront to all life, and banned in most lands.  
> Catalyst: staff"

### Acquired From

  * [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis") in Lost Bastille, [Magerold of Lanafir](/Magerold+of+Lanafir "Dark Souls 2 Magerold of Lanafir")
  * Sold by [Darkdiver Grandahl](/Darkdiver+Grandahl "Dark Souls 2 Darkdiver Grandahl") for 1500 after joining the [Pilgrims of Dark](/Pilgrims+of+Dark "Dark Souls 2 Pilgrims of Dark") Covenant.

### Notes

  * Effectively a shotgun, this spell is useful for killing large enemies. Similar to Dark Bead from _Dark Souls_ but it isn't affected by gravity. Deals around the same amount of damage as [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Great Resonant Soul") at a slower casting speed provided all orbs hit the enemy, low precision and short range, it is, however, effective on staggering large enemies
