    | Attack Name | Attack Description |
    | --- | --- |

    | Fire/Dark aura | Aldia makes flames surround him in between attacks, dealing fire and dark damage. |
    

### DKS2 Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin Strategy

Here is a playbook with helpful info on Aldia. He is about average difficulty overall, with some key things that are hard to understand when you first fight him. Aldia only has a few nuances that need to be noted, which I will explain below:

  1. Aldia tends to teleport. When he does, he may teleport to your location, in which case you want to be standing about a foot outside of where the glow of his fire ends, as this marks the end of the AOE. This is a good way to give yourself time to hit him. 
  2. Aldia is only really vulnerable when he is not ignited with flame all around him.
  3. Aldia has a multi-shot homing fireball attack. It is advisable to sprint through this attack at a time when there is space, as the fireballs come in bursts of variable length.
  4. Aldia has an attack where he charges a fireball. To deal with this, wait for him to fire, and IMMEDIATELY sprint, then roll as it is about to explode on the ground.
  5. Aldia has an attack where he summons a bunch of tentacles in a line. He telegraphs by pulling out a single tentacle and planting it in the ground. During this time, back up so you have room, and when the attack starts going, roll towards where the first two tentacles come out. The tentacles have a maximum turning angle of about 45 degrees, which you can take advantage of. It is also really helpful to run towards his right flank at about 90 degrees from the front of his face.
  6. Do NOT hit Aldia at close range when he is surrounded by fire. The fire will repeatedly damage you and he will take significantly less damage.

#### Melee strategy

Aldia has no attacks that must be rolled. When he does his Charged Fireball attack, you have around 5 safe seconds to deal damage to him. Run away from the fireball and it should miss you. When he slams just one tentacle in the ground, the attack can be a really badly tracking tentacle attack, much like [Fire Snake](/Fire+Snake "Dark Souls 2 Fire Snake") pyromancy. It can also be a little bit better tracking but otherwise same kind of attack that starts not from the tentacle that slams in the ground, but from any side of Aldia closest to you. Both can be evaded by running clockwise around Aldia when he is slamming the one tentacle. After this attack you have time to deal 1-3 swings at Aldia before the fire shield comes back up.   
When he does homing fire mass, just run sideways to avoid the balls, or use a spell parry shield. When he does the AoE tentacle attack, look for opening after the second AoE effect is starting (red dots on the ground) and go deal some damage to Aldia. Every time Aldia has a fire shield on, use whip, spear or any other longer range weapon to deal damage, but remember he takes less damage.   
Aldia has around 5 spawn points in the arena, one in the middle and 4 in the corners of the arena. It's recommended to run around the middle, and when Aldia starts to spawn run to him for couple free hits. If Aldia happens to spawn really close to you, run away so the AoE blast he creates when spawning doesn't hit you.

### Dark Souls 2 Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin Lore/Dialogue

Introduction at the final Primal Bonfire

  * _No one has come this far, not for a very long while._  
_Young Hollow, do you wish to shed this curse?_  
_Then accept the fate of your ilk, and face the trials that await you._  
_Unless, you have already joined the crestfallen_
  * _Young Hollow, there are but two paths. Inherit the order of this world, or destroy it.  
But only a true monarch can make such a choice.  
Very few, indeed, have come even this far.  
And yet, your journey is far from over.  
Half-grown Hollow, have you what it takes, truly?_
  * _Young Hollow, seek after Vendrick.  
He who almost became a true monarch.  
Vendrick is certain to guide your way.  
Fledgeling Hollow, may we meet again._

At the Undead Crypt

  * _Heheh, I believe we've been acquainted._  
_Young Hollow, conqueror of fear._  
_What drives you so, to overcome this supposed curse?_
  * _Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.  
Some are true to their purpose, though they are but shells, flesh and mind.  
One man lost his own body, but lingered on, as a head.  
Others chase the charms of love, however elusive. What is it that drives you?_
  * _Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity.  
And men assumed a fleeting form. These are the roots of our world.  
Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite...  
A lie will remain a lie.  
Young Hollow, knowing this, do you still desire peace?_
  * (Answer Yes or No)  _Vendrick, the near-true monarch, is here, and not far off.  
But what is a king? You, neither born with greatness, nor granted it by the fates.  
What is it that you seek? You cannot even say yourself.  
We shall meet again, young Hollow._

In the Dragon Shrine

  * _Young Hollow. How you grapple, without falter, with this dreadfully twisted world.  
__Peace grants men the illusion of life.  
Shackled by falsehoods, they yearn for love, unaware of its grand illusion.  
Until, the curse touches their flesh. We are bound by this yoke.  
As true as the Dark that churns within men._
  * _All men trust fully the illusion of life. But is this so wrong?  
A construction, a facade, and yet... A world full of warmth and resplendence.  
Young Hollow, are you intent on shattering the yoke, spoiling this wonderful falsehood?_
  * (Answer Yes or No)_I am Aldia.  
I sought to shed the yoke of fate, but failed.  
Now, I only await an answer. Seek the throne.  
Seek light, Dark and what lies beyond..._

At the Throne of Want

  * _Many monarchs have come and gone._  
_One drowned in poison, another succumbed to flame._  
_Still another slumbers in a realm of ice._  
_Not one of them stood here, as you do now._  
_You, conqueror of adversities.__Give us your answer._

After his defeat

  * _I lost everything, but remained here, patiently.  
The throne will certainly receive you.  
But the question remains...  
What do you want, truly?  
Light? Dark? Or something else entirely..._

Ending Narration

  * _There is no path.  
__Beyond the scope of light, beyond the reach of Dark...  
...what could possibly await us?   
And yet, we seek it, insatiably...  
Such is our fate._

### Dark Souls 2 Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin Lore

  * Lord Aldia is King Vendrick's elder brother. He aided his brother in founding the kingdom of Drangleic, but he then secluded himself in his manor, searching for the secrets of life, viewing the Undead as the key to finding it. Through his experiments, Aldia sought to learn the nature of the undead curse, and to shed the yoke of fate.
  * Due to a dispute on the research of souls, or the research methods on how to end the Curse, Vendrick locked Aldia away in his keep. It was there that Aldia "kept Giants in his manor, and attempted to recreate a dragon, but after some time, was not heard from again".
  * With the release of Scholar of the First Sin, it is revealed that Aldia did not become the Ancient Dragon, but was transfigured into a blob-like creature that appears to be composed of fire, witchtree branches and a glowing red eye. He will appear to the player at the the last Primal Bonfire they reach, the entrance to the Undead Crypt and the Dragon Shrine. If spoken to in all of these locations he will become the final boss after defeating Nashandra at the Throne of Want.
  * His dialogue ranges from benign to going as far as to express outward rage at Gwyn, Lord of Cinder, who is referred to by Aldia as the "Lord of Light". The scholar describes how the old Lord of Sunlight expelled the darkness, and began the cycle of light and dark. This cycle, this curse, forced men to assume a fleeting form, reverting them back to their hollow form. They became less than what they were, and to Aldia, this is the first sin he has taken his name from. He claims that men are mere props, and that no matter how exquisite, a lie will remain a lie. The anger is audible in his voice at this point, an expression of his fury at the commitment of the first sin, the first linking of the flame.
