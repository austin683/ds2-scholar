**Hollow Priest** is an [enemy](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Hollow Priests** , spectral guardians concealed within the dense fog of the central Shaded Woods. Engage them effectively using wide-sweeping weapons for easier hits, as locking on is not possible. Area-of-effect magic, like Firestorm, proves highly useful. Two variants exist—one wielding a sword and dagger, the other a crossbow and dagger. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Dark Souls 2 Hollow Priest Information

Guardian spirits lurking in the thick fog of the central Shaded Woods. Their identities are completely unknown, as they barely maintain corporeal forms and are almost invisible against the mist. Are they fallen soldiers of a war long past, or the remnants of a clan that once dwelled in this ancient land?

Best fought using weapons with a wide arc of attack so that they can be hit easier. Player can not lock-on. Area of effect magic, such as Firestorm, is greatly helpful. There are two variants, one with a sword and dagger, and one with a crossbow and dagger. However, they can be marked with the hex Profound Still, if you lure them to the forest entrance.
