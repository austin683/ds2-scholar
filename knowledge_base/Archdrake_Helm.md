**Archdrake Helm** is a [Helm](/Helms "Dark Souls 2 Helms") in Dark Souls 2.

_"Helmet worn by the[Archdrake sect of Lindelt](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim")._   
_Though little is actually known about the order, it is said their well-honed miracles and unwavering faith in the face of death made them worthy rivals to Drangleic's forces in their day."_

_Scholar of the First Sin changed to:_   
_"Little is known about the Archdrake sect and its ancient rituals, and those who dare to indulge their curiosity have been known to simply vanish._   
_The Archdrake sect are the keepers of Lindelt's histories, including the only record of its foundation, a tome they have good reason to keep hidden away."_

### Location

  * Pieces of the armor are dropped by enemies in the [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana").
  * The Archdrake Robes are located at the Lost Bastille. Near the location where you receive the [Wanderer set](/Wanderer+Set "Dark Souls 2 Wanderer Set"), there is a building near it. Next to a wall are explosive barrels. Detonate them to reveal a hidden room containing the robes and an [Archdrake Shield](/Archdrake+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Shield").

### Archdrake Helm Notes

  * Part of the [Archdrake Set](/Archdrake+Set "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Set"). 
    * Originally, the full armor set was named the 'Dragonknight Set' and the [Archdrake sect of Lindelt](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") was named 'Silverdrake Knights of Lindelt'.
  * Upgraded with normal [Titanite](/titanite "Dark Souls 2 titanite").
  * The helm increases [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") by +1.
