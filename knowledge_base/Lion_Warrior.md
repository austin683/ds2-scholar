##  Lion Warriors
    
    
    | Phenomenally tough beast-men within the Shaded Ruins, armed with powerful axes and shields. Possessed of a fierce hatred of both humanity and the undead, they are both territorial and aggressive. Equipped with cursed battle axes, they can inflict curse status on an unfortunate undead in only a few swings, even through shields! They possess an incredibly strong resistance against magic of any kind; infused melee weapons will avail themselves little against these beasts, and they are highly resistant to both poison and bleeding. In exchange, however, they are somewhat vulnerable to physical damage, but their skill with both their axes and shields is daunting and they stand as some of the toughest foes one can face. They are especially vulnerable to backstabs. |  |
