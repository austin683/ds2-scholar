**Human Effigy** is a type of **[Consumable](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables")** in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. This is an important item for a player's restoration. In previous titles, this item allows full regeneration and the ability to interact with Summon signs, but in Dark Souls II, it instead removes any impacting curses or effects that affect the health bar. Any effects or penalties can be undone with this item. The Human Effigy in Dark Souls 2 can be stacked and collected after it is obtained through many different methods. The easiest way to have it at the start of the game is to begin with it as a Starting [Gift](/Gifts "Dark Souls 2 Gifts"), which will ensure players will have it at the start of the game in their inventory. [Consumable Items](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") grant various effects such as restorative properties for recovering HP, removing certain negative status effects, applying temporary buffs and debuffs, as well as activating various actions and effects.

> A warm, soft, shadow like effigy. Use this item to reverse Hollowing. It also weakens the links to other worlds, invasions and most cooperation.  
> Peer closely at an effigy, and one begins to perceive a human form, but whose form it takes depends on the person looking."

  * One can be found in a chest upstairs in the Seer's Hut.

There are 7 of them and also 3 [Amana Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") which drop [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").

### DKS2 Farming Effigies

The following locations provide the quickest ways to obtain large quantities of Human Effigies:

  * The earliest way to farm these without the need for [Bonfire Ascetics](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") is in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). Either try to get them from the [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") or the [Skeletons](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton"), reachable after defeating [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant") and getting the [Soldier Key](/Soldier+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldier Key"). If you go down the ladder at the Soldier's Rest bonfire, take a turn to the left. Going through the doorway on the left side, you get into the room where the mist to the rooftops was. On the right side of this room is a door, which now can opened with the key, which leads down a darkened area, inhabited by 6 respawning [Skeletons](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton").
  * Burning a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") in Majula allows you to slay the Skeletons below the mansion, each of which guarantees a Human Effigy. The amount of Skeletons is equal to the bonfire intensity. (This may not be 100%. On a farm of an intensity 7 fire, only 6 effigies dropped from 7 skeletons.)
  * Burning a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at the first Bonfire in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") allows you to re-open the chest in the cave located at the start of the forest, collecting 5 Human Effigies.
  * Burning a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at the first Bonfire in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") allows you to re-open the wooden chest in the secret area beyond the well, collecting 5 Human Effigies.
  * Killing [Amana Aberrations](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") (Lizardmen) in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana"). They have a 7% chance of dropping humanity (Tested with [Jester's Cap](/Jester%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Jester%27s Set"), [Prisoner's Tatters](/Prisoner%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner%27s Set"), and [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring +1](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring") : drops pretty often). When they don't spawn anymore, burning a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") or joining the company of champions will respawn them.
  * Burning a Bonfire Ascetic at the Tower of Prayer bonfire in Dragon's Sanctum allows you to farm an infinite amount of Human Effigies at the spike trap staircase as well as [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"), [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"), [Focus Soul](/Focus+Souls "Dark Souls 2 Focus Souls").
  * _AFTER PATCH 1.10_ Human Effigies now drop from defeated Red Phantom players (either players who have invaded you using a [Cracked Red Eye Orb](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb"), or opponents you have summoned from their [Red Sign Soapstone](/Red+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 Red Sign Soapstone"))**.** Invading NPCs also count for this. Defeating an Abyss Spirit (invading or summoned player in the [Dark Chasm of Old](/Dark+Chasm+of+Old "Dark Souls 2 Dark Chasm of Old")) or defeating a host you have invaded or been summoned by in a Chasm will also yield a Human Effigy in addition to a Bonfire Ascetic. Belfry invaders, Dragon Spirits, Arbiter Spirits, and players summoned via the Rat Ring do not award Human Effigies on death. Defeating a player you have invaded will not give a Human Effigy except for when invading in the Dark Chasm of Old.

### Negating the Loss of Humanity

If you wish to bypass the penalty of losing Human Effigies, you can simply equip the [Ring of Life Protection](/Ring+of+Life+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Life Protection") or the [Ring of Soul Protection](/Ring+of+Soul+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Soul Protection"). By doing so you can now die and keep all of your souls and your state of Humanity without using a Human Effigy. You can then repair the ring at the blacksmith of your choice for 3000 or 6000 souls (14000 souls each in SOFS).   
Additionally, you will never hollow once you obtain all 4 crowns and receive [Vendrick's Blessing](/Vendrick%27s+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick%27s Blessing"), effectively nullifying the need for Human Effigies.

### Becoming Human without Human Effigy

In the [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana") (4th bonfire), there is an altar you can pray to and you can become human. After you defeat the boss, proceed to the right instead of entering the Undead Crypt and follow this path to the fourth bonfire (in [Scholar of the First Sin](/Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin") you will also need a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") to enter the bonfire location as the way is blocked by a statue). Take the staircase and you will come to the door. It only becomes unlocked if you're hollow. Follow this path and you will come across an altar with the last [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito") sitting in front of it. You can pray in front of the altar and become human if you satisfy the following requirements:

  * You have talked to the 'ghost Milfanito' woman before the boss
  * You have zero Human Effigies in your inventory and your item box (dropping them on the ground and activating the shrine won't work, tested in Scholar of the First Sin with "-" Sin level)
  * You have not killed any of the [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito")
  * You mustn't have a high [Sin](/Sin "Dark Souls 2 Sin") level (needs more testing)

  
Another way to become human without the Human Effigy is to assist other players in their worlds by being summoned as a Phantom or a Shade. You will need to fully assist the host before becoming human by either killing a boss as a Phantom or by helping the host for a certain amount of time as a Shade. As well as earning a set amount of souls as a Shade.   
  
Also seems to occur after killing the owner of the world after being summoned by

  * [Bell Keepers](/Bell+keepers "Dark Souls 2 Bell keepers")
  * [Dragon Eye](/Dragon+Eye "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Eye")
