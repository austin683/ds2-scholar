**Mastodon Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

  
  
  
_"Helm/Armor/Gauntlets/Leggings worn by the Primal Knights of Drangleic castle._   
_Their weight would normally crush a man, but the Primal Knights wear them as if they were silk, so fearsome is their brutal strength._   
_The King restored a forbidden, long-lost art to create these inhuman abominations. "_

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Primal Knights](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight") at the entrance and inside of [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"). 
    * [Scholar of the First Sin] Primal Knights are only found at the entrance.

  
  
  

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Leggings offer second highest physical defenses – the highest among armor pieces upgraded with regular Titanite. Other best pieces are: [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior+Set "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior Set") Greathelm and chestpiece, [Steel](/Steel+Set "Dark Souls 2 Steel Set") / [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper+Set "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper Set") / [Mastodon](/Mastodon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Mastodon Set") gauntlets and [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Set") leggings.
  * Leggings also offer second highest poise (almost equal to that of [Looking Glass](/Looking+Glass+Set "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Set") and [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon Set") leggings).
  * Requires 16 STR.
  * The entire set is worn by [Steel-willed Lorrie](/Steel-willed+Lorrie "Dark Souls 2 Steel-willed Lorrie"), an NPC summon in [Old Iron King DLC](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King").
  * There's also [Rusted Mastodon](/Rusted+Mastodon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Mastodon Set") set that's dropped by the same [Primal Knights](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight") in [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros"). This set is ~10% lighter and ~20% worse in all stats.
