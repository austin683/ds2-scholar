## **Majula**

  
****

**Majula** is a [Location](/Locations "Dark Souls 2 Locations") in **Dark Souls 2**. It is a coastal town encountered early on in the game which serves as the player's hub. It has paths to various new regions and some of the characters you meet relocate to here. The area is nearly a safe haven, but there are some [Enslaved Pigs](/Undead+Devourer "Dark Souls 2 Undead Devourer") that can be farmed for [Cracked Red Eye Orbs](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb") and [Skeletons](/skeleton "Dark Souls 2 skeleton") that lie beneath [Majula Mansion](/Majula+Mansion "Dark Souls 2 Majula Mansion") which drop [Human Effigies](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). While early access is possible, Majula's Pit will lead to either the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") or [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter").****

### Full Majula Walkthrough

### Cavern Detour

From [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt") walk down the narrow path. Start by taking a left after the stones end and going up the hill to arrive at a cave, tunneling you to a room of archways. Entering the last open archway brings you down a leaf littered path where you encounter an NPC sitting by a column. This character is named [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo"). There's little reason to interact with him until the path ahead is unblocked, but no penalty for stopping to chat either. Ahead of him is a structure with a doorway with its lever’s use blocked by a statue. Before entering the structure, to the left of the stairway you'll find a corpse with 3x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") and 3x [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone").

Inside the structure you come into a round and open room with a doorway straight ahead, and one cell on either side. The lever to operate the doorway is blocked by a statue that appears to be a petrified woman. Upon examining, you are told that a statue blocks your way. From the cell to the left, a Festering Hollow -wielding a poisonous axe-like weapon made of bones- paces back and forth and will burst through the gate after some time. In its cell, lies a corpse with 3x [Lloyd’s Talisman](/Lloyd%27s+Talisman "Dark Souls 2 Lloyd%27s Talisman"). The other cell holds an unarmed Festering Hollow who uses fists to attack.

Once obtaining a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore"), you can un-petrify the statue which allows access to the pull mechanism. [Rosabeth of Melfia](/Rosabeth+of+Melfia "Dark Souls 2 Rosabeth of Melfia") (the ex-statue) will ask for clothes which can be donated to her using her menu. Giving her at least one item of clothing will prompt her to move to the main area of **Majula** where she will proudly display the results of you playing Dark Souls NPC dress up. Giving her clothes also gives you a trophy/achievement. She is a pyromancy trainer and can upgrade your pyro gloves, as well as sell you useful items. The now accessible door she prevented you from opening leads to the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"). If you don't have a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") at the moment (and you don't since we're assuming this is your first playthrough), back track to return to the initial cave entrance. Down the hill, if you hug the wall to the left, is a corpse in front of a tree with a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing").

### Scenic Route to the Bonfire

You can enter Majula down a path lined with stones on either side, however we're going for 100% completion so up you go, back to the narrow path as if we are reentering from [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt"). This time, instead of heading left or straight, look for a ledge on the cliff to your right; but don't just jump off willy-nilly. Instead look for a platform you can drop to (should be the second ledge). You'll notice nothing on this level, so drop off once again to find a corpse carrying a [Morning Star](/Morning+Star "Dark Souls 2 Morning Star") and [Cleric's Sacred Chime](/Cleric%27s+Sacred+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Cleric%27s Sacred Chime"), directly under the platform you just dropped from. Continue along the path, making sure to hug the wall as you go, to find another corpse where the [Binoculars](/Binoculars "Dark Souls 2 Binoculars") can be found. Take this path until you find the [Bonfire](/bonfire "Dark Souls 2 bonfire").

### Meeting the Locals

Proceed to the right cliff to find the [Emerald Herald](/Emerald+Herald "Dark Souls 2 Emerald Herald"), speak to her to receive an [Estus Flask](/estus+flask "Dark Souls 2 estus flask"), and trigger her to move to the bonfire where she can provide leveling and [Estus](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask") upgrades. Killing her nets you a grand total of 0 souls, however scores you the [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") and will likely screws up your game, considering that she is the only way to level up and reinforce your [Estus](/estus+flask "Dark Souls 2 estus flask").

Behind that are a set of steep steps that lead to a statue where [Crestfallen Saulden](/Crestfallen+Saulden "Dark Souls 2 Crestfallen Saulden") sits. He grants you the chance to join his covenant, '[Way of Blue](/Way+of+the+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Way of the Blue")' which allows you to receive help from the [Blue Sentinels](/Blue+Sentinels "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinels"); join his covenant and he'll give you a [Blue Seal Ring](/Blue+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Blue Seal") which increases your health ever-so slightly. He will also teach you the [gesture](/Gestures "Dark Souls 2 Gestures") “Welcome” and gives hints about how to reach nearby areas from Majula if you keep talking to him. He also briefly explains the bonfire, messages (Online play feature), and summon signs.

Back down the steps and to the right find the village with a few houses. [Blacksmith Lenigrast](/Blacksmith+Lenigrast "Dark Souls 2 Blacksmith Lenigrast") sits outside his workshop, unable to get in without [Lenigrast's Key](/Lenigrast%27s+Key "Dark Souls 2 Lenigrast%27s Key"); you can purchase the [ Key](/Lenigrast%27s+key "Dark Souls 2 Lenigrast%27s key") from [Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") in [the Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). Inside his house, there is a chest that contains a [Short Bow](/Short+Bow "Dark Souls 2 Short Bow"). This also allows him to access his tools, and upgrade and repair equipment as well as become available as a [merchant](/Merchants "Dark Souls 2 Merchants"). Killing him yields 1350 souls and [Blacksmith's Hammer](/Blacksmith%27s+Hammer "Dark Souls 2 Blacksmith%27s Hammer") (which is not crap like the first game), however you obviously lose everything else that he offers and he'll later give you the hammer anyway. On the right side of his house, find a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and 3x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem").

Another house is home to the cat [Sweet Shalquoir](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir"), who sells items, and provides info on [covenants](/covenants "Dark Souls 2 covenants") and allows you to abandon them. Right outside her house, there is a corpse with a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Attacking [Shalquoir](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir") leads to her taunting you; she cannot be hurt and will not aggro, and will still interact normally after being attacked. Go past [Shalquoir's](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir") house and up the cliff on the right, where you will approach a large stone. A corpse to the left has 5x [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"). Standing in front of the **Victor’s Stone** prompts you to kneel and you can enter the covenant [Company of Champions](/Company+of+Champions "Dark Souls 2 Company of Champions"), and offer [awestones](/awestone "Dark Souls 2 awestone") to increase covenant rank. New players are advised not to join this covenant, because joining it will make every enemy in the game stronger. It also disables cooperative play.

A [mansion](/Majula+Mansion "Dark Souls 2 Majula Mansion") here is locked for the time being, and another house is home to [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") who sells armor and related items. If you enter his house and go up the ladder there is a chest with a [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard"). His stock is lackluster now, but will expand the more you buy from him and as you defeat certain enemies.

Many [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") you meet will relocate to Majula after you encounter them, adding to the shops and services available. Two of the earliest are [Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia"), a merchant from the [Cardinal Tower](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower") bonfire in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"), and [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt"), from [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame"). She can open a path to the [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse") for 2000 souls.

In the corner by the house, is a mud patch where 3 [Undead Devourers](/Undead+Devourer "Dark Souls 2 Undead Devourer") (the pigs) can be found. They are immediately hostile when approached and have a chance to drop [Cracked Red Eye Orbs.](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb") These small pigs are surprisingly strong for their size and new players may find it hard fighting them.

### The Mansion of Majula

In front of the locked [mansion](/Majula+Mansion "Dark Souls 2 Majula Mansion") is a well. Hitting the rock drops it into the well, raising a corpse with an [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard"). It's advised to get this shard as soon as possible. After talking with [Cale the Cartographer](/Cale+the+Cartographer "Dark Souls 2 Cale the Cartographer") in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"), he will provide you with a [key](/Mansion+Key "Dark Souls 2 Mansion Key") to this [Mansion](/Majula+Mansion "Dark Souls 2 Majula Mansion").

Entering the mansion there are paths straight back and to the right. Heading straight back leads to a small library where a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") can be found. Heading to the right leads around the mansion and to another split. The player can choose to go upstairs or further back into the mansion:

  * Heading up the stairs leads to a small second floor room and a balcony-like area outside. Inside the room is a chest containing 3x [Titanite shard](/Titanite+shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite shard") and 3x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch").
  * Heading back downstairs and toward the back of the mansion, the player enters a large chamber with what appears to be a map carved into the floor. A single small flame appears on the map at this time. A short staircase leads to another chamber where a single [Skeleton](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") awaits. It does not revive and drops a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") when killed. A smaller chamber inside this area contains a chest that holds a [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel"). There is a skeleton corpse with an [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard") in front of the door, with the chest.

### The Pit to the Gutter 

This is the pit in the middle of Majula. Buying the [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") from [Shalquoir](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir") for 13,400 souls, allows you to drop to the first board walkway in the pit without dying, as long as your VGR is 5 (768 HP).  _NOTE: You must be wearing only the[Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring"), have 0.5% equip burden, and not have any forward momentum while dropping. It will still cause MAJOR damage. Recommended to go to the Forest and/or the Tower first, and return to the pit at a higher level.  
_

The first set of boards you drop onto has a corpse with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). The second has a corpse with a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone"). The third has 3x [Poison Moss](/Poison+Moss "Dark Souls 2 Poison Moss"). At this point you can jump to a small ledge with torches that leads directly to the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") area or continue down to another ledge with a ladder. The ladder leads to a locked door that accesses [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"). More jumping from board to board will arrive at a corpse with a [Ring of the Evil Eye](/Ring+of+the+Evil+Eye "Dark Souls 2 Ring of the Evil Eye")+1, and another ledge lined with torches. This marks the bottom of the pit that can be explored and leads to a tunnel. A [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal lizard") will run off a bridge with a gap in the middle, and the lack of enemies to thwart you here should make this very easy to get. Jumping across the gap leads to a chest with the [Ash Knuckle Ring](/Ash+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Ash Knuckle Ring"). A corpse holding the [Disc Chime](/Disc+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Disc Chime") is visible to the left but is inaccessible for now.

The pit below you can be jumped into but with extreme caution. There is water that will slow your movement so attempt to gain land as soon as you can. A group of exploding Small Mummies will rush you. They have low health but will try to trigger an Area of Effect explosion when nearby. Unlike the ones in the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"), these mummies die upon exploding. There are two tunnels from which the Mummies came from. One has water covering the floor while the other does not. The watery path leads to a skeleton who holds [Great Heal](/Great+Heal "Dark Souls 2 Great Heal"). The other leads to scaffolding. Be careful here as once you go down the first ladder, you cannot go back up it (due to it being incomplete). Looking toward the ladder you fell down, move left to a series of two ladders. A corpse with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") waits for you there. Climb back up and move to the right which begins a series of ladders down. Look for another corpse holding a Radiant Lifegem near the bottom. Once you use the last ladder, there is no way back up again. A chest at the base holds a [Token of Spite](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite"). Following the tunnel out leads to [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter").

### Entrance to Heide's Tower of Flame

To the left of the cliff where the **Victor’s Stone** is, there is a large stone archway, with a staircase going down a tunnel. Coming to a circular room, there is a pillar in the center with a symbol on it. Examining it mentions that the the contraption does not move. [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt") is able to later open a path to [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse") after encountering her in [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame").

Going to the right down the hallways to a spiral staircase, on the left there is a chest with [Crimson Parma](/Crimson+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Parma"). Continuing down the stairs takes you to a room with a large door, which entering and staying to the ledge on the left, will bring you to a pull chain which opens the door. Going through the door leads to a waterway, and up the stairs is another pull chain to open the door should you wish to go back and further on a corpse with [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead") and [Broken Thief Sword](/Broken+Thief+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Broken Thief Sword"). Going down the hallway takes you to the entrance of [Heide’s Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame").

### Entrance to Forest of Fallen Giants

Starting at the bonfire, looking out over the ocean at the cove with all of the spiky rocks sticking up, look to your right along the coast. ~10 strides away you'll see a crumbling wall; on the sea side of the wall is a torch sconce marking an entrance that leads down to an underground stone rampway. To the right of the main path in, you'll find an iron chest (chest is a Mimic in NG+) with a [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin"). Proceeding down the hallway, there is a dead end to the right and to the left a large gated door. Pulling the lever to the right opens the gate.

The path opens up to a cave with a wooden bridge that spans a stream. Once past the bridge going to the right leads to [the Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") and to the left there are two long planks to a large stone with a chest that contains [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") x1. Beyond in the stream is a corpse with a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone") and [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead").

### Full Majula Walkthrough

### Cavern Detour

From [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt") walk down the narrow path. Start by taking a left after the stones end and going up the hill to arrive at a cave, tunneling you to a room of archways. Entering the last open archway brings you down a leaf littered path where you encounter an NPC sitting by a column. This character is named [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo"). Killing him nets 2000 souls and he drops the [Bluemoon Greatsword](/Bluemoon+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Bluemoon Greatsword"). Ahead of him is a structure with a doorway with its lever’s use blocked by a statue. Before entering the structure, to the left of the stairway you'll find a corpse with 3x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") and 3x [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone").

Inside the structure you come into a round and open room with a doorway straight ahead, and one cell on either side. The lever to operate the doorway is blocked by a statue that appears to be a petrified woman. Upon examining, you are told that a statue blocks your way. From the cell to the left, a Festering Hollow -wielding a poisonous axe-like weapon made of bones- paces back and forth and will burst through the gate after some time. In its cell, lies a corpse with 3x [Lloyd’s Talisman](/Lloyd%27s+Talisman "Dark Souls 2 Lloyd%27s Talisman"). The other cell holds an unarmed Festering Hollow who uses fists to attack.

Obtaining a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore"), can un-petrify the statue which allows access to the pull mechanism. [Rosabeth of Melfia](/Rosabeth+of+Melfia "Dark Souls 2 Rosabeth of Melfia") (the petrified statue) will ask for clothes which can be donated to her using her menu. Giving her an outfit will prompt her to move to the main area of **Majula** where she will proudly display the results of you playing Dark Souls NPC dress up. Giving her clothes also gives you a trophy/achievement. She is a pyromancy trainer and can upgrade your pyro gloves, as well as sell you useful items. The now accessible door she prevented you from opening leads to the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"). If you don't have a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") at the moment (and you don't since we're assuming this is your first playthrough), back track to return to the initial cave entrance. Down the hill, if you hug the wall to the left, is a corpse in front of a tree with a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing").

### Scenic Route to the Bonfire

You can enter Majula down a path lined with stones on either side, however we're going for 100% completion so up you go, back to the narrow path as if we are reentering from [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt"). This time, instead of heading left or straight, look for an opening on the cliff but don't just jump off willy-nilly, instead look for a platform you can drop to (should be the second opening). You'll notice nothing on this level, so drop off once again to find a corpse carrying a [Morning Star](/Morning+Star "Dark Souls 2 Morning Star") and [Cleric's Sacred Chime](/Cleric%27s+Sacred+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Cleric%27s Sacred Chime"), directly under the platform you just dropped from. Continue along the path, making sure to hug the amount as you go, to find another corpse where the [Binoculars](/Binoculars "Dark Souls 2 Binoculars") can be found. Take this path until you find the [Bonfire](/bonfire "Dark Souls 2 bonfire").

### Meeting the Locals

Proceed to the right cliff to find the [Emerald Herald](/Emerald+Herald "Dark Souls 2 Emerald Herald"), speak to her to receive an [Estus Flask](/estus+flask "Dark Souls 2 estus flask"), and trigger her to move to the bonfire where she can provide leveling and [Estus](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask") upgrades. Killing her nets you a grand total of 0 souls, however scores you the [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") and will likely screws up your game, considering that she is the only way to level up and reinforce your [Estus](/estus+flask "Dark Souls 2 estus flask").

Behind that are a set of steep steps that lead to a statue where [Crestfallen Saulden](/Crestfallen+Saulden "Dark Souls 2 Crestfallen Saulden") sits. He grants you the chance to join his covenant, '[Way of Blue](/Way+of+the+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Way of the Blue")' which allows you to receive help from the [Blue Sentinels](/Blue+Sentinels "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinels"); join his covenant and he'll give you a [Blue Seal Ring](/Blue+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Blue Seal") which increases your health ever-so slightly. He will also teach you the [gesture](/Gestures "Dark Souls 2 Gestures") “Welcome” and gives you light directions on how to get to [the Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") and [Heide’s Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame") and points out other elements of Majula’s geography, such as the pit in the middle of the town which is not accessible at the start (he suggests a ladder will be needed). He also briefly explains the bonfire, messages (Online play feature), and summon signs. Killing him yields 800 souls and the [Ring of Steel Protection](/Ring+of+Steel+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Steel Protection"). However, you may also acquire the [Ring](/Ring+of+Steel+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Steel Protection") by talking to him after dying 100 times.

Back down the steps and to the right find the village with a few houses. [Blacksmith Lenigrast](/Blacksmith+Lenigrast "Dark Souls 2 Blacksmith Lenigrast") sits outside his workshop, unable to get in without [Lenigrast's Key](/Lenigrast%27s+Key "Dark Souls 2 Lenigrast%27s Key"); you can purchase the [ Key](/Lenigrast%27s+key "Dark Souls 2 Lenigrast%27s key") from [Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") in [the Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). Inside his house, there is a chest that contains a [Short Bow](/Short+Bow "Dark Souls 2 Short Bow"). This also allows him to access his tools, and upgrade and repair equipment as well as become available as a [merchant](/Merchants "Dark Souls 2 Merchants"). Killing him yields 1350 souls and [Blacksmith's Hammer](/Blacksmith%27s+Hammer "Dark Souls 2 Blacksmith%27s Hammer") (which is not crap like the first game), however you obviously lose everything else that he offers. On the right side of his house, find a[ Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and 3x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem").

Another house is home to the cat [Sweet Shalquoir](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir"), who sells items, and provides info on [covenants](/covenants "Dark Souls 2 covenants") and allows you to abandon them. Right outside her house, there is a corpse with a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Attacking [Shalquoir](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir") leads to her taunting you; she cannot be hurt and will not aggro, and will still interact normally after being attacked. Go past [Shalquoir's](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir") house and up the cliff on the right, where you will approach a large stone. A corpse to the left has 5x [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"). Standing in front of the **Victor’s Stone** prompts you to kneel and you can enter the covenant [Company of Champions](/Company+of+Champions "Dark Souls 2 Company of Champions"), and offer [awestones](/awestone "Dark Souls 2 awestone") to increase covenant rank. New players are advised not to join this covenant, because joining it will make every enemy in the game stronger. It also disables cooperative play.

A [mansion](/Majula+Mansion "Dark Souls 2 Majula Mansion") here is locked for the time being, and another house is home to [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") who sells armor and related items. If you enter his house and go up the ladder there is a chest with a [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard"), and killing him gives you 900 souls and he drops his armor the [Tseldora Set](/Tseldora+Set "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Set") -probably not worth it again.

The merchant [Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") moves to Majula after meeting her in [the Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") and sits down along the wall near the bonfire. Later on Majula will become populated by other [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") as you encounter them. For examaple: after encountering her in [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame"), [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt") moves below the town, near the contraption that does not move on your first inspection. She can open a path to the [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse") for 2000 souls.

In the corner by the house, is a mud patch where 3 [Undead Devourers](/Undead+Devourer "Dark Souls 2 Undead Devourer") (the pigs) can be found. They are immediately hostile when approached and have a chance to drop [Cracked Red Eye Orbs.](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb") These small pigs are surprisingly strong for their size and new players may find it hard fighting them.

### The Mansion of Majula

In front of the locked [mansion](/Majula+Mansion "Dark Souls 2 Majula Mansion") is a well. Hitting the rock drops it into the well, raising a corpse with an [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard"). It's advised to get this shard as soon as possible. After talking with [Cale the Cartographer](/Cale+the+Cartographer "Dark Souls 2 Cale the Cartographer") in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"), he will provide you with a [key](/Mansion+Key "Dark Souls 2 Mansion Key") to this [Mansion](/Majula+Mansion "Dark Souls 2 Majula Mansion").

Entering the mansion there are paths straight back and to the right. Heading straight back leads to a small library where a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") can be found. Heading to the right leads around the mansion and to another split. The player can choose to go upstairs or further back into the mansion:

  * Heading up the stairs leads to a small second floor room and a balcony-like area outside. Inside the room is a chest containing 3x [Titanite shard](/Titanite+shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite shard") and 3x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch").
  * Heading back downstairs and toward the back of the mansion, the player enters a large chamber with what appears to be a map carved into the floor. A single small flame appears on the map at this time. A short staircase leads to another chamber where a single [Skeleton](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") awaits. It does not revive and drops a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") when killed. A smaller chamber inside this area contains a chest that holds a [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel"). There is a skeleton corpse with an [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard") in front of the door, with the chest.

### The Pit to the Gutter 

This is the pit in the middle of Majula. Buying the [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") from [Shalquoir](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir") for 13,400 souls, allows you to drop to the first board walkway in the pit without dying, as long as your VGR is 5 (768 HP).  _NOTE: However, you must be wearing only the[Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring"), have 0.5% equip burden, and not have any forward momentum while dropping. It will still cause MAJOR damage._

The first set of boards you drop onto has a corpse with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). The second has a corpse with a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone"). The third has 3x [Poison Moss](/Poison+Moss "Dark Souls 2 Poison Moss"). At this point you can jump to a small ledge with torches that leads directly to the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") area or continue down to another ledge with a ladder. The ladder leads to a locked door that accesses [The Gutter](/Gutter "Dark Souls 2 Gutter"). More jumping from board to board will arrive at a corpse with a [Ring of the Evil Eye](/Ring+of+the+Evil+Eye "Dark Souls 2 Ring of the Evil Eye")+1, and another ledge lined with torches. This marks the bottom of the pit that can be explored and leads to a tunnel. A [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal lizard") will run off a bridge with a gap in the middle, and the lack of enemies to thwart you here should make this very easy to get. Jumping across the gap leads to a chest with the [Ash Knuckle Ring](/Ash+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Ash Knuckle Ring"). A corpse holding the [Disc Chime](/Disc+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Disc Chime") is visible to the left but is inaccessible for now.

The pit below you can be jumped into but with extreme caution. There is water that will slow your movement so attempt to gain land as soon as you can. A group of exploding Small Mummies will rush you. They have low health but will try to trigger an Area of Effect explosion when nearby. Unlike the ones in the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"), these mummies die upon exploding. There are two tunnels from which the Mummies came from. One has water covering the floor while the other does not. The watery path leads to a skeleton who holds [Great Heal](/Great+Heal "Dark Souls 2 Great Heal"). The other leads to scaffolding. Be careful here as once you go down the first ladder, you cannot go back up it (due to it being incomplete). Looking toward the ladder you fell down, move left to a series of two ladders. A corpse with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") waits for you there. Climb back up and move to the right which begins a series of ladders down. Look for another corpse holding a Radiant Lifegem near the bottom. Once you use the last ladder, there is no way back up again. A chest at the base holds a [Token of Spite](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite"). Following the tunnel out leads to [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter").

### Entrance to Heide's Tower of Flame

To the left of the cliff where the **Victor’s Stone** is, there is a large stone archway, with a staircase going down a tunnel. Coming to a circular room, there is a pillar in the center with a symbol on it. Examining it mentions that the the contraption does not move. [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt") is able to later open a path to [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse") after encountering her in [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame").

Going to the right down the hallways to a spiral staircase, on the left there is a chest with [Crimson Parma](/Crimson+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Parma"). Continuing down the stairs takes you to a room with a large door, which entering and staying to the ledge on the left, will bring you to a pull chain which opens the door. Going through the door leads to a waterway, and up the stairs is another pull chain to open the door should you wish to go back and further on a corpse with [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead") and [Broken Thief Sword](/Broken+Thief+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Broken Thief Sword"). Going down the hallway takes you to the entrance of [Heide’s Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame").

### Entrance to Forest of Fallen Giants

Starting at the bonfire, looking out over the ocean at the cove with all of the spiky rocks sticking up, look to your right along the coast. ~10 strides away you'll see a crumbling wall; on the sea side of the wall is a torch sconce marking an entrance that leads down to an underground stone rampway. To the right of the main path in, you'll find an iron chest (chest is a Mimic in NG+) with a [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin"). Proceeding down the hallway, there is a dead end to the right and to the left a large gated door. Pulling the lever to the right opens the gate.

The path opens up to a cave with a wooden bridge that spans a stream. Once past the bridge going to the right leads to [the Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") and to the left there are two long planks to a large stone with a chest that contains [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") x1. Beyond in the stream is a corpse with a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone") and [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead").
