### Syan's Gauntlets Description

"Replica of the armor of the loyal knight Syan. This solidly-crafted gear offers high defense.  
Sir Syan was widely known as the Kingdom's most loyal knight, and when the Giants invaded, he volunteered to lead the advance party, but he was slaughtered most dishonorably.  
The King commissioned replicas of Syan's accoutrements and bestowed them on promising knights, but not long after they donned the armor did most go thoroughly mad."

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Found on Knights in Drangleic Castle
