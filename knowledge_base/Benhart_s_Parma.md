**Benhart's Parma** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing. 

_"Small shield of Benhart of Jugo.  
  
This parma, emblazoned with a family crest of some sort, has  
clearly been around for several generations, but has no special value."_

### Acquired From:

  * [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") (Purchasable after Benhart's death)
  * [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo") (Upon completing his quest)

### Benhart's Parma Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * This is a relatively light shield requiring very little strength. If you happened to kill Benhart for some reason, the shield provides excellent magic defense early-on, giving a monstrous 98.7% magic defense at +9 while infused with Magic, making it a great go-to shield for magic heavy areas (such as [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana")). Beyond this it makes a great lightweight magic defense shield that still retains pretty good physical defense and okay resistances to the other elements.
  * Closely resembles a [Foot Soldier Shield](/Foot+Soldier+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Foot Soldier Shield"), but with a distinct antler horn crest painted over it.
  * This shield would reappear in _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Elkhorn Round Shield](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Elkhorn+Round+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Elkhorn Round Shield").
