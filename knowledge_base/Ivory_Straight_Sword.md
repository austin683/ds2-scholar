**Ivory Straight Sword** is a **[Straight Sword](/Straight+Swords "Dark Souls 2 Straight Swords")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. The **Ivory Straight Sword** , upgraded with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5, showcases a slower version of the typical [Straight Sword](/Straight+Swords "Dark Souls 2 Straight Swords") moveset. It cannot be infused or enchanted and deals Strike damage. During attacks, the sword emits a visible beam of light, extending its range similar to the [Ivory King Ultra Greatsword](/Ivory+King+Ultra+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Ivory King Ultra Greatsword"). Power stancing allows dual-wielding with two blades. While compatible with weapons like the [Warped Sword](/Warped+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Warped Sword") and [Majestic Greatsword](/Majestic+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Majestic Greatsword"), it consumes more stamina than other straight swords.

>   
> Sir Fabian led the loyal knights of Eleum Loyce straight into the depths of chaos to exterminate the terrible things that dwelled there, but not one of the selfless knights returned.

### DS2 Ivory Straight Sword Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5
  * Has a slower version of the normal Straight Sword moveset.
  * Cannot be infused or enchanted.
  * Produces a beam of light that dramatically extends the blade's length when attacking, similar to the [Ivory King Ultra Greatsword](/Ivory+King+Ultra+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Ivory King Ultra Greatsword") that is visible even with the [Illusory Ring of the Exalted](/Illusory+Ring+of+the+Exalted "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of the Exalted") [Illusory Ring of a Conqueror ](/Illusory+Ring+of+a+Conqueror "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of a Conqueror") equipped.
  * Compatible with power stancing, produces two blades while dual wielding two Ivory Straight Swords.
  * Compatible with [Warped Sword](/Warped+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Warped Sword"), emits beam during unique double spin while draining its durability twice.
  * Also compatible with [Majestic Greatsword](/Majestic+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Majestic Greatsword"), emits beam upon spinning jump.
  * Does not produce any blade at less than required stats.
  * Consumes noticeably more stamina than all other straight swords.
  * Has absolutely no scaling and will generally do far less physical damage and poise damage than similar weapons in the straight sword class.
  * Two-handed strong attack is extremely strong (~3x listed damage).
  * Loses 10 durability per swing, and difficult to repair due to its high maximum durability--highly recommended to equip [Bracing Knuckle Ring +2](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring").
  * Only situationally useful.
  * The beam does damage but more damage can be dealt if the physical handle also hits the target--the difference can be double the damage if both hit in some cases.
  * The beam ignores wall collision physics; however, the handle does not.
  * It uses the dagger/rapier backstab animation and damage system.
  * An attack from this weapon will still deal damage when parried.
