**Wrathful Axe** is a **[Halberd](/Halberds "Dark Souls 2 Halberds")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Wrathful Axe** is a potent halberd, dealing strong physical damage and scaling primarily with [Strength](/Strength "Dark Souls 2 Strength"). **Wrathful Axe's** 2-handed special attack (L2/LB) inflicts both poison buildup and dark damage, comparable to the poison dealt by throwing knives.

> An armament forged from the soul of Elana, child of Dark. 
> 
> Use strong attack to unleash its latent power.
> 
> When the Abyss dissipated, the things that called it home were fragmented and scattered across the realm.

> Eventually these pieces regained form, in ways that hinted at humanity's true nature.

### How to get Wrathful Axe in Dark Souls 2

  * Trading 24000 souls and the [Soul of Elana, Squalid Queen](/Soul+of+Elana%2C+Squalid+Queen "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Elana%2C Squalid Queen") with [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex")

### DS2 Wrathful Axe Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with [Petrified dragon bone](/Petrified+dragon+bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified dragon bone") to +5
  * Two-handed L2 /LB does a dark magic aura attack after a short wind-up.
  * The Two-handed L2 /LB AoE attack can be used to hit enemies on the other side of walls or doors.
  * The AOE attack damage can be increased with dark infusions and buffs.
  * The Wrathful Axe 2-handed special attack (L2/LB) deals poison build-up as well as dealing dark damage. This seems to be a flat value equivalent to that dealt by poison throwing knives. It doesn’t seem to be modified by the Crest of the Rat or the Sanctum Soldier Gauntlet but buffing the weapon with Rotten Pine Resin seems to double the poison build up dealt (halves the number of attacks needed to inflict poison). This is also the case with poison infusion. Curiously, when the Red Tearstone Ring is activated it seems to increase the poison build up but less so than resin or infusion. The same goes for the Channeler’s Trident buff and the Dragon Torso Stone buff. See discussion for testing notes.
