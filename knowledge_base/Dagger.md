**Dagger** is a [Dagger](/Daggers "Dark Souls 2 Daggers") and one of the available [Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **Dagger** is a weapon with quick, precise strikes, but low attack power and short reach. It's best for players who like fast attacks and can chain them together. It's effective in critical situations like backstabs, parries, and guard breaks, dealing high damage to weaker enemies. It also has low stamina use and can stun enemies, creating openings for more attacks.

### DS2 Dagger Hints and Tips

  * Exceedingly powerful in backstabs, parries, and guard break attacks. Even with low DEX and a base level dagger it can still reliably hit for 400-800 damage. Due to the high criticals it can hit for.
  * Commonly infused with Mundane in old patches of the game, current balancing makes Mundane daggers do less damage than uninfused in all but extremely high level characters.
  * Its poise damage and low stamina consumption allows to consistently stun low poise enemies such as Licia.
