**Nashandra** is a [Boss](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses") and [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Nashandra** , a [child of Dark](/Children+of+Dark "Dark Souls 2 Children of Dark") equipped with a scythe and proficient in the arts of dark magic, poses a formidable challenge to the player. Her attacks carry significant lethality, capable of delivering fatal blows with a single strike. Additionally, she summons wisps akin to the [Cursed Vessel](/Cursed+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Cursed Vessel") encountered in the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"), albeit swifter and possessing the ability to inflict direct damage. These wisps can be eliminated using any form of attack.****[Bosses](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses") are unique and challenging Enemies that drop [Boss Souls](/Boss+Souls "Dark Souls 2 Boss Souls") capable of being transformed into powerful [Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons"), [Spells](/Spells "Dark Souls 2 Spells"), and [Items](/Items "Dark Souls 2 Items") for the player.

## Dark Souls 2 Nashandra Overview

Queen Regent of Drangleic, who takes her monstrous form immediately after the player defeats the [Throne Watcher and Throne Defender](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher and Throne Defender") boss. She wields a scythe and uses dark magic against the player. Most of her attacks have the potential to kill in one hit. She also summons wisps that will curse you similarly to the [Cursed Vessel](/Cursed+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Cursed Vessel") in the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"), though they are much faster and can directly damage you. They can be destroyed with any attack.   
  
Nashandra can also be encountered at [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") as an NPC, guiding you to seek the [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon") and the [Giants](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord").

### Nashandra Encounters in Dark Souls 2

[Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"). Encountered in human form sitting in a faraway throne, right before the dual [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider") boss fight arena. Disappears after obtaining the [Giant's Kinship](/Giant's+Kinship "Dark Souls 2 Giant's Kinship"). (Nashandra can also disappear if one attacks her from the balcony, however this may require long ranged spells/arrows and possibly the Hawk Ring. I was able to do it by Soul arrow and aiming at her knees).

[Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Throne of Want"). To access Nashandra, you need to have defeated [Throne Watcher and Throne Defender](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher and Throne Defender") and obtained the [Giant's Kinship](/Giant's+Kinship "Dark Souls 2 Giant's Kinship") and the [King's Ring](/King's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King's Ring").

### Nashandra Attacks in DKS2
    
    
    |  | Description | Counter Measures |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Dark Nova | Nashandra charges and releases an explosion of darkness, damaging and knocking back all who are around her. / Hint: She uses this move around 50% HP. | Back away as soon as you see her charging the dark energy. |
    | Vertical Dark Laser | Nashandra lifts her hand and releases a laser which starts near her and ends far from her in a straight line. | Easy to dodge (best to roll away right before she uses it). Can be blocked but will likely kill you with a 2nd hit due to the stamina drain. |
    | Horizontal Dark Laser | Nashandra lifts her hand and releases a laser that moves horizontally covering 1/4 of the area. / As of the new patch, this move is much faster than before but can be blocked. | It's possible to block the laser, but it drains a lot of stamina. / The laser is pointed into the ground, so you can back away from it. / If you're more or less close to Nashandra, it's not difficult to roll under the laser. |
    | Scythe Swing | Nashandra swings with her scythe once, usually if you're not directly in front of her, but to her sides. / Nashandra can also swing twice slowly then swing again after a second. | Can be dodged and blocked. |
    | Plunge | Nashandra strikes once and hits the ground with her scythe, as if she's stuck, this helps you land some attacks . | Can be dodged and blocked. |
    | Lifedrain Patch | Nashandra projects a few orbs that inflict curse and also drain HP continuously if you're close to them. | You can break the orbs with weapons or spells. Ranged attacks are preferable. / As the arena is quite large, you can simply move away from the orbs and wait until Nashandra comes closer, out of the orbs' range. She barely moves if you're close so it's a good strategy, especially with fist weapons (which can't break the orbs)[Caestus, at least, can break the orbs - confirmed on a power stance dual Caestus run. Bone Fist also breaks the orbs with ease, at least with the 1-handed running attack]. |
    

## DKS2 Nashandra Strategies

### Basic Notes

  * Attacking the grey wisps the boss summons will make them disappear, but it may also cause [Curse](/Status+Effects "Dark Souls 2 Status Effects") buildup, which will cause you to lose HP. That being said, it's a good idea to at least kill the one nearest the door when you enter, in order to give yourself some room to attack.
  * Wait for her to swing, then dodge. An easy way to do this is to roll toward her scythe; it will pass over you and land in front of her, which allows you to attack her.
  * You can summon NPCs for this fight; in SotFS, there are 5 available NPCs to choose from, but you can only have a max of 3 with you at once. Using NPCS will allow you to stand back and shoot her with a bow; this can be time consuming, however, and the summons will likely die before she does. The available summons are: 
    * [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo"). Found to the left of the boss fog. Only available if you've progressed his quest.
    * [Head of Vengarl](/Head+of+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Head of Vengarl"). Found to the right of the boss fog. Only available if you completed his quest.
    * [Bashful Ray](/Bashful+Ray "Dark Souls 2 Bashful Ray") (SotFS). Found in the Ruin Sentinels/Stone Soldiers room, near one of the golems in the back.
    * [Pilgrim Bellclaire](/Pilgrim+Bellclaire "Dark Souls 2 Pilgrim Bellclaire") (SotFS). Found outside of the Dragonrider's boss room. It is advised to clear the path between this room and Nashandra's before bringing him down.
    * [Bradley of the Old Guard](/Bradley+of+the+Old+Guard "Dark Souls 2 Bradley of the Old Guard") (SotFS). Found to the left of the fog gate only if you've progressed to the point where Aldia is set up to be the final boss.
  * It may be worth keeping your [Human Effigies](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") in the hotbar as they can restore your cursed health mid-fight. You'll need space to use it, plus a healing item afterward.
  * The [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame") seems to be effective, as the more Hollow you are the more powerful it gets. At full upgrade, 2 Flame Swaths can drain a significant amount of her health.

### NPCs + Items Strategy

Another simple strategy that works for all builds is to wear the [Ring of Restoration](/Ring+of+Restoration "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Restoration"), [Ring of Binding](/Ring+of+Binding "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Binding"), [Dark Quartz Ring](/Dark+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Dark Quartz Ring") (or [Dispelling Ring](/Dispelling+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Dispelling Ring")) & [Cursebite Ring](/Cursebite+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Cursebite Ring") and buy at least 20 [Lifegems ](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem")from [Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") and 30 [Holy Waters](/Holy+Water+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Holy Water Urn") in the [Blue Cathedral](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue"). When the battle starts, simply strafe around her once you are able to target her, but watch out about the holes on the platforms if you get too far back.   
  
Destroy the two closest curse constructs and run directly in front of her (continue holding forward running into her). If you are close enough her attacks go right over your head and you can swing away while your NPCs attack. A great club +10 with lighting resin added. This will do about 600+ attack on NG and kill her rather quickly. Use stamina recovery items to make its faster.   
  
Don’t worry about her dark energy constructs and their curse status because you are going to be using the Lifegems to immunize yourself against the curse drain; use a Lifegem as soon as you get cursed and after her next attack use another; between the Lifegems and the Ring of Restoration your health will be fine and you can use the [Holy Water](/Holy+Water+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Holy Water Urn") to keep out of range while using a good shield or simply use your regular attack strategy while strafing. Don’t forget to pop a lifegem every 20 seconds for the curse damage or in case she hits you with an attack so you don’t have to stop to use your Estus flask.

### Ranged Strategy (Solo)

I stayed along the outer perimeter shooting Fire Arrows at her, unlocked, with the [Hunter's Blackbow](/Hunter's+Blackbow "Dark Souls 2 Hunter's Blackbow") +10. The distance baited Nashandra to use her laser attack almost exclusively. Dodge that by simply moving clockwise or counter-clockwise out of the way and then firing more arrows. Once or twice I would kill a curse wisp if it was in my path, but if you use the tip above for negating curse effects you don't have to concern yourself with them. The person above who said using bow is time-consuming is not accurate. I made short work of her with a couple dozen fire arrows. Never took a hit, never was in any danger. I've since replicated this on my second character. By moving slowly around the edge of the field, you basically limit her moves to one (the laser attack) and it's laughably slow and predictable.

### Ranged Strategy (NPCs)

The Range strategy is probably the easiest way to beat the Last Boss. As said above, by distancing yourself from her, she is limited to the laser beam attack. The laser beam attacks in two ways. If one stays still, it will shoot directly and slowly climb upwards. If one walks around her, the laser will start to follow you slowly. My build is a Bandit, with a Dragonslayer Bow +5, and around 200 Lightning Arrows (bought it from [Chancellor](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") in [Drangleic](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle")). Before the fight, it is advised to summon the two phantoms that are provided before the boss battle. If you let the two phantoms fight her alone, you should have enough time to take quick shots at her hp before both of them dies. I have gotten her HP down by over a half thanks to them. Once your phantoms are dead, try to strafe around her and try your best to avoid the wisp, and take several shots at her once she tries to summon more wisp. It took me around 1-3 mins, and probably used up around 50 or so arrows to finish her off.

### Miracles + Lightning Spear

**Miracles and Lightning Spears:** I used a maxed-out [Dragon Chime](/Dragon+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Chime") with Lightning infusion and I destroyed her in about 5-6 hits with [Greater Lighting Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear") and [Sunlight Spear](/Sunlight+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Spear"). (With 50 Faith and a +5 Lightning Dragon Chime, it took me 14 [Great Lightning Spears](/Great+Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear"), while Benhart and Vengarl kept her occupied, The entire fight took less than a minute. - MultiracialLion)

I was able to defeat this boss by baiting her into firing her laser, running in and casting [Firestorm](/Firestorm "Dark Souls 2 Firestorm") right on her. [Firestorm](/Firestorm "Dark Souls 2 Firestorm") would damage her a few times, I would dodge backward to avoid her attacks, bait the laser attack, and repeat. After using 4 Firestorms, finished her off with two [Flame Swathes](/Flame+Swathe "Dark Souls 2 Flame Swathe"). As for the curse clouds, I would destroy one or two just to give myself room to bait the attack.

### Pyromancy + Gower's Ring

**Easy Pyromancy + Gower's Ring Strategy** : Before entering the fog I popped 4 regular lifegems to negate most of the health drain inflicted by curse. I used my [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame") +10 and made sure to have [Gower's Ring of Protection](/Gower's+Ring+of+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Gower's Ring of Protection") equipped (I have 30/30 INT/FAI). Upon entering the fog I immediately ran right up towards Nashandra, turned my back to her (IMPORTANT so that Gowers ring works), and unleashed 2 casts of [Chaos Storm](/Chaos+Storm "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Storm") which took her to a little over quarter health. By this time she had set up her curse clouds and began whacking me with her scythe. Gowers ring negated all damage from her sword and the lifegems were doing a good job of negating the curse damage. I then cast [fire Tempest](/Fire+Tempest "Dark Souls 2 Fire Tempest") twice to finish her off (after one cast she was all but dead the second was safer than turning to face her to use any other attack). It was all over in seconds. You just have to make sure you keep your back to her so her attacks do no damage thanks to Gowers ring. Nice and easy.

### Nashandra Hints in DKS2

  * You do NOT have to fight the [Throne Defender](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher and Throne Defender"), [Throne Watcher](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher and Throne Defender"), Nashandra, and [Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin](/Aldia,+scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Aldia, scholar of the First Sin") back to back. It is possible to use a homeward bone or feather IMMEDIATELY after the Throne Watcher and Defender battle ends (it helps to have it on your quick-slots). It worked for me, the Nashandra cinematic played, but as soon as it ended, I was back at the bonfire.
  * If you defeat [Throne Watcher and Throne Defender](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher and Throne Defender") before the [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord"), an alternate cutscene will trigger where Nashandra is already waiting in the boss room for the player, however, the cutscene dialogue is still the same.
  * [Great Lightning Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear") works really well just stay at a safe distance and use gear that allows faster casting, Should defeat her in a matter of minutes.
  * Using [Ceastus](/Caestus "Dark Souls 2 Caestus") during this fight can prove difficult, as they are unable to hit the cursed orbs to dispel them.
  * Using the [Rebel's Greatshield](/Rebel%27s+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Rebel%27s Greatshield") with the Dark infusion is immensely helpful for anyone that has it, for it has 100% dark negation and will completely nullify her laser and nova attacks.
  * She shares similar moveset to [Darklurker](/Darklurker "Dark Souls 2 Darklurker").

### Dark Souls 2 Nashandra Dialogue

  * _Visit Vendrick_
  * _We have no need for two rulers..._
  * _..._

Talk after acquiring the [King's Ring](/King's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King's Ring")

  * _Drangleic is no longer._
  * _Brave Undead, seek the throne. Follow the symbol of the monarch, and do what must be done._

### Nashandra Trivia in Dark Souls 2

  * According to the official guidebook, NPC dialogues, and item descriptions she is a fragment of Manus, Father of the Abyss.
  * By using the sky-walking glitch, you can get to Nashandra on her throne in Drangleic Castle. Hitting her with a melee weapon makes her laugh at you. After three hits, she will start to stand up, but disappear. (You can see the same effect without glitches if you shoot her with a [Hunter's Blackbow](/Hunter%27s+Blackbow "Dark Souls 2 Hunter%27s Blackbow") or [Sea Bow](/Sea+Bow "Dark Souls 2 Sea Bow") while a [Hawk Ring](/Hawk+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Hawk Ring") is equipped.)
  * Nashandra is voiced by Harriet Kemsley, a comedy actress.
