_"Robe worn by Hollowed Drangleic mages._  
  
_Drangleic mages wore different garb depending on their sex. What function this served, however, is unknown, as with many old practices. This is a women's hood/robe. "_

### Location

  * Drop from [Necromancer](/Necromancer) in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse) and [Undead Purgatory](/Undead+Purgatory) (they do respawn in Undead Purgatory, in case of farming for the hood and [Lizard Staff](/Lizard+Staff)).
  * Sorcerer starting equipment (robe only).

### Notes

  * Part of the [Black Hollow Mage Set](/Black+Hollow+Mage+Set).  

    * The male variant is [White Hollow Set](/White+Hollow+Set).
    * The hood is inferior and heavier than the white hood despite being rare, while the black robe is better than the white robe despite heavier.
  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore).
  * [Carhillion of the Fold](/Carhillion+of+the+Fold) wears this robe (without hood) regardless the fact it is a women's robe.
  * The robe is their full height according to concept arts, that's why they have no trousers for this set.
