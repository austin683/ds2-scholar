**Alonne Knight** is an [enemy](/enemies "Dark Souls 2 enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. Clad in [Iron Armor](/Alonne+Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Set"), the **Alonne Knights** were trained by [a visitor](/Sir+Alonne "Dark Souls 2 Sir Alonne") to the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"), and fight viciously with Katanas while their [captains](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") snipe with the [Alonne Greatbow](/Alonne+Greatbow "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Greatbow"). Though the knights occupying these armors have long since turned to dust, they remain at their posts and active as spirits entombed within their armor. They are amazingly fast for such heavily-armored foes, and are capable of sudden advances and retreats using their weapon of choice, the [Blacksteel Katana](/Blacksteel+Katana "Dark Souls 2 Blacksteel Katana"). Their armor has impressive physical resistance, but they are vulnerable to magical damage, quickly going down from lightning, magic, strike weapons, or darkness. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Information

_The Alonne Knights' loyalty to one another is the stuff of legends, and they held fast in their positions even as the once-great Iron Keep sank into the fiery earth.  
The blades they wield were forged by one of the true artisans entertained by the Iron King during his kingdom's hayday_

### Alonne Knight Strategy Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Try to avoid fighting Alonne Knights in groups as their slash attacks have substantial recovery. They're most susceptible to attack following their lunge attacks that have increased recovery time.
  * A Dagger+1 with [Ring of Blades](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades") will one shot them with a backstab/riposte (in NG). Easier done using a shield and defending until they execute the lunge, then rolling and backstabbing.
  * [Stone Ring](/Stone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Stone Ring") can be very helpful for taking them down if you have a decently fast weapon (for e.g. a longsword).
  * Fighting one at a time will make the Iron Keep (or Shaded Woods on NG+) simpler.
  * Can be parried.
  * Immune to [Yearn](/Yearn "Dark Souls 2 Yearn") spell and [Alluring Skull](/Alluring+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Alluring Skull") item.
