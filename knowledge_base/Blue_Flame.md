**Blue Flame** is a **[Straight Sword](/Straight+Swords "Dark Souls 2 Straight Swords")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Blue Flame's** unique feature is its ability to cast sorceries with 100 cast speed during its Strong Attack. It's a valuable choice for Intelligence builds, though it cannot cast [Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes"), only [Sorceries](/Sorceries "Dark Souls 2 Sorceries"). 

> Straight sword wielded by Leydia apostles.  
>   
> Imbued with a special magic that makes the Blue Flame both a sword and magic catalyst. Execute a strong attack to emit magic.  
>   
> The Leydia apostles, adept at magic, wielded unique weapons but were hunted down as traitors.

### How to get Blue Flame in Dark Souls 2

  * Random drop from [Leydia Pyromancers](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt").
  * Potential drop from dual-wielding red phantom in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") after burning [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic").

### DS2 Blue Flame Hints and Tips

  * Upgrade with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5
  * Its Strong Attack will cast sorceries with 100 cast speed ([Clear Bluestone Ring](/Clear+Bluestone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Clear Bluestone Ring") does affect Blue Flame's casting speed), making it a versatile option for Int builds. However, it cannot cast Hexes, only sorceries.
  * Unlike catalysts, Blue Flame can be buffed with resins and sorcery powers increased with [Magic Weapon](/Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Magic Weapon"), [Great Magic Weapon ](/Great+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Great Magic Weapon") and [Crystal Magic Weapon](/Crystal+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Magic Weapon")
  * **Spell-based buffs increase the elemental damage on a weapon by a percentage of that elemental damage already present on the weapon... Catalysts (staffs, chimes, pyro-flames) have no affect on the potency of spell-based buffs.**
    * **example: Blue flame +5 (disregarding scaling for a moment) has 163 base magic damage. Crystal Magic Weapon is applied like so: (163 x 1.3) + 50 = 211.9 + 50 = 261.9 =~ 262 magic damage.**
  * Buffing Blue Flame also seem to benefit the spell damage as well and equipping Ring of Blades. Also Aromatic Ooze outperforms Crystal Magic Weapon significantly, so much that you would need more than 50 int for Magic Blue Flame to do better damage.
  * Infused with "Raw", Blue Flame is capable of doing very high spell damage - even at 12 intelligence - making it possible to use spiced down, very damaging spells, with almost no relevant stats.
  * Infusing with "Magic" will benefit any wielder with **68 Intelligence or above;** this, combined with the ability to cast [Soul Spear](/Soul+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Soul Spear") at a low height (allowing for point blank casting), makes it a deadly weapon for a high INT built caster. .
  * If looking for a dual wield build with sorceries Blue Flame is an excellent choice (be sure to wield Blue flame in the right hand, as the Power stance overrides the Sorcery casting).
  * At least one blue flame must be equipped in order to have two weapons equipped with the same sorcery-based buff at the same time (either use two blue flames or use a staff to buff the blue flame and then switch to a weapon and buff it with the blue flame)
  * Once in power-stance, the left handed strong attack will function as it would with regular straight swords. The regular right hand Strong Attack will remain able to cast spells.
  * The Blue Flame's cast source is from the grip, not the blade, making the casting height similar to a chime.
  * If paired with [Hidden Weapon](/Hidden+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Hidden Weapon") or [Illusory](/Illusory+Ring+of+a+Conqueror "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of a Conqueror") [Rings](/Illusory+Ring+of+the+Exalted "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of the Exalted"), one can create an illusion as if one is able to **cast spells with his/her** **bare hands** , a very useful trick for catching PvP foes off guard..
