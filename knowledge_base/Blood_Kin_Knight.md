#  Blood Kin Knight

  
**_In a land to the distant South, there is said to exist an order of knights... honorable, violent souls.... These knights worshipped the source of all life... Not fire, nor the soul, but blood.... They devoted their lives to the red substance..._** corrupting  **_it...._** spilling  **_it... all in the name of kinship with the living... but in these times of strife, who is to say what is living or dead?_**   
**_The Blood Kin knights knew only of blood and honor... and there is no honor without death... The Knight would need to cure his curse... the Curse of the Undead.... in order to look his brothers and sisters of arms in the eyes again... and so, this crimson relic wanders the haunted land, once known as Drangleic..._**   
  
This is a DEX, END, and ADP heavy build, primarily used for PVE and CO-OP, although it could be effective in PVP. It's a semi-roleplay build, hence the use of the Red Sign Soapstone, if one is into PVP. This build is highly adaptable. Defensively, this build focuses on wearing relatively light armor, and dodging attacks. Offensively, it focuses on punishing attackers with fast attacks (Via powerstance), stunlocks, and debilitating status effects. This build is really more of a framework than a full build, as there are many ways to go about this. This build has not been tested for high level gameplay yet. Any input is welcome. This is also my first build.

#  **Stats**

  * **The stats for this build will vary greatly, depending on your choice of weapons.**
  * **Because of this, these stats are more suggestions, rather than rules.**
  * **Obviously, stats will differ depending on your level.**
    * **Vigor**
      * 20-30
      * Sink spares into this at higher levels
    * **Endurance**
      * 30-40
      * Sink spares into this at higher levels
      * If using Twinblades, you will _**need**_ a high endurance stat.
    * **Vitality**
      * Enough that you will be under 70% of your equipment weight, using your choice of gear.
    * **Attunement**
      * Base
    * **Strength**
      * Enough that you can either: 
        * Powerstance your choice of 1 handed weapons 
          * OR
        * Wield your choice of twinblade
    * **Dexterity**
      * 40
      * Throwing knives of all types scale with Dexterity, although not very much.
      * Bleed and Poison both scale with Dexterity as well.
    * **Adaptability**
      * Opinions on this stat vary greatly; personally, I prefer to sink spare points into this.
      * Adaptability increases your Poison and Bleed resistances, as well as your agility.
      * Higher agility means more invincibility frames during rolls.
    * **Intelligence**
      * Base
    * **Faith**
      * Base

* * *

#  **Other**

  * You'll need to use an evasive playing style for this build. 
    * A shield can be used, but isn't necessary.
    * Be prepared to learn how to dodge.
    * You need to be careful of your stamina with this build; Don't get greedy with attacks.
  * Personally, I think this build is a great contrast to heavy builds; Many heavy weapon users use the Elite Knight Set, which is a good contrast to this build, appearance wise.
  * Don't expect to tank very effectively with this build.
  * When dodging vertical attacks, it's more a matter of piking a direction and hoping you're not rolling into anything sharp/hot/hungry.
  * When dodging horizontals, it's best to roll toward the attack, not away from it. 
    * You want the attack to hit you during your invincibility frames. Rolling into the attack causes you to spend less time In the attack, meaning you'll be more likely to be hit with you I-frames up meaning no damage)
  * Twinblades will devour your stamina, so be careful.
  * The Mail Breaker can be downright lethal when it comes to critical hits, don't underestimate it.
  * If anybody has any input, comment away!
