**New Game Plus** is a mechanic of **Dark Souls 2** that allows players to reset their journey but continue on with the same character, facing against tougher opponents and becoming stronger in the process. Once the [Final Boss](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") has been defeated in the [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Throne of Want"), the player can rest at the bonfire in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") and choose to begin another playthrough. The second playthrough is referred to as "NG+," the third "NG+2," etc., going all the way to "NG+7".

Advancing into the next playthrough will cause the entire game to essentially 'revert' to the beginning. The player will begin in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt") with all bonfires deactivated and all bosses, NPCs, and items respawned. However, the player will still retain their levels, souls and all items, with some exceptions (see below).

##  New Game + Dark Souls 2 Guide

###  What will carry over to NG+

  * Soul Level.
  * [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory").
  * All [consumable souls](/Souls "Dark Souls 2 Souls") currently being carried.
  * All weapons and armor, including 'Item Box' items.
  * Most consumable items and equipment.
  * [Pharros' Lockstones](/Pharros'+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone") remain, but all contraptions will be locked again.
  * [Souls of Giants](/Soul+of+a+Giant "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Giant") remain.
  * DLC crowns remain, but Vendrick won't recognize them, so [blessing](/Vendrick's+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick's Blessing") cannot be received at once after obtaining [Ashen Mist Heart](/Ashen+Mist+Heart "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Mist Heart").
  * Any [Bonfire Ascetics](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") used will retain their effect (so if a Bonfire Ascetic is used in NG to transform that area's difficulty to NG+, when the player enters NG+ that particular bonfire's intensity will be increased by one above the normal limit).
  * All pyromancies, sorceries, hexes, and miracles.
  * The number of Estus Flask charges and their upgrade level.
  * Covenants joined and covenant ranks achieved.
  * [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather").
  * [Sins](/Sin "Dark Souls 2 Sin").

###  What doesn't carry over

  * All unused [Fragrant Branches of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore").
  * All [keys](/keys "Dark Souls 2 keys"), including [Ladder Miniature](/Ladder+Miniature "Dark Souls 2 Ladder Miniature").
  * All key items: [Key to the Embedded](/Key+to+the+embedded "Dark Souls 2 Key to the embedded"), [Crushed Eye Orb](/Crushed+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Crushed Eye Orb") (don't forget to invade [Licia](/Licia+of+Lindelt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindelt") BEFORE NG+ or you'l have to wait to get it back in Undead Crypt) and the [King's Ring](/King%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Ring").
  * [Dull Ember](/Dull+Ember "Dark Souls 2 Dull Ember") will need to be reacquired before [Steady Hand McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff") can imbue weapons with elements again (no worries for SoFS owners, since ember is located much closer to the smith).
  * All unlocked doors, shortcuts, etc. will need to be reopened.
  * All previously opened [Pharros' Contraptions](/Pharros'+Lockstone#.UzxNO3lOXIV "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone#.UzxNO3lOXIV") will be locked.
  * DLC: Crow of the Old Iron King smelter wedges and Nadalia's Soul shards (the complete soul itself does carry over)

### Changes to the game

    * [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory") ranges continue to work in "tiers" but, since characters will have more souls by natural progression, the pools are wider.
    * Enemies deal increased damage and have more health.
    * Enemies will drop more souls, albeit with diminishing increments: +100% in NG+, +25% in NG+2, +10% in NG+3, +9,1% in NG+4, … ??? in NG+7.
    * There will be more enemies in most of the areas; usually Dark spirits versions of common enemies and NPCs.
    * [Shrine of Winter](/Shrine+of+Winter "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Winter") will require 1M [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory") more (2M for NG+, 3M for NG+2, etc.) in **current run** to be unlocked if 4 great souls are not obtained. All previously gathered souls are not counted towards new memory.
    * [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") will have some covenant items and spells for sale at NG+2.
    * Certain bosses will drop a ring or an additional great soul when defeated. 
      * [The Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner"): [Old Witch Soul](/Old+Witch+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Old Witch Soul")
      * [The Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja"): [Old Paledrake Soul](/Old+Paledrake+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Old Paledrake Soul")
      * [Old Iron King](/Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Old Iron King"): [Old King Soul](/Old+King+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Old King Soul")
      * [The Rotten](/The+Rotten "Dark Souls 2 The Rotten"): [Old Dead One Soul](/Old+Dead+One+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Old Dead One Soul")
      * [Mytha, the Baneful Queen](/Mytha%2C+the+Baneful+Queen "Dark Souls 2 Mytha%2C the Baneful Queen"): [Covetous Silver Serpent Ring +2](/Covetous+Silver+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Silver Serpent Ring")
      * [Belfry Gargoyles](/Belfry+Gargoyle "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Gargoyle"): [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring +2](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring")
      * [Executioner's Chariot](/Executioner%27s+Chariot "Dark Souls 2 Executioner%27s Chariot"): [Chloranthy Ring +2](/Chloranthy+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Chloranthy Ring")
      * [Velstadt, the Royal Aegis](/Velstadt%2C+the+Royal+Aegis "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt%2C the Royal Aegis"): [Royal Soldier's Ring +2](/Royal+Soldier%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier%27s Ring")
      * [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Knight"): [Ring of Steel Protection +2](/Ring+of+Steel+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Steel Protection")
      * [Twin Pursuers](/The+Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 The Pursuer"): [Ring of Blades +2](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades")
      * [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord"): [Ring of Giants +2](/Ring+of+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Giants")
      * [Skeleton Lords](/The+Skeleton+Lords "Dark Souls 2 The Skeleton Lords"): [Clear Bluestone Ring +2](/Clear+Bluestone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Clear Bluestone Ring")
      * [Scorpioness Najka](/Scorpioness+Najka "Dark Souls 2 Scorpioness Najka"): [Southern Ritual Band +2](/Southern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Southern Ritual Band")
      * [Throne Watcher and Throne Defender](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher and Throne Defender"): [Ring of the Evil Eye +2](/Ring+of+the+Evil+Eye "Dark Souls 2 Ring of the Evil Eye")
    * Some boss fights change slightly. 
      * [The Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner") will summon two Dark spirit Pyromancers when reduced to about 60% health.
      * Two [Nimble Shadows](/Nimble+Shadow "Dark Souls 2 Nimble Shadow") will drop on either side of the [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry") as soon as the player enters the fight. They apply Bleed debuff upon striking the player.
      * [The Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja") will spawn and attack the player before they have passed through the first set of spider-engraved doors in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). If one dies during this event five times, she will no longer appear. Alternatively, the player can turn and run back up the path once she appears. After some time, she will eventually go back down and never spawn there again. The damage one has inflicted onto Freja here will persist when one enters the actual boss fight (even if one dies after the damage is done?(yes)).

###  Illusory Ring Walkthrough

      * If you decide to go for the [Illusory Ring of the Exalted](/Illusory+Ring+of+the+Exalted "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of the Exalted") / [Conqueror](/Illusory+Ring+of+a+Conqueror "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of a Conqueror") (which require a walkthrough by no death, no resting at a bonfire) be sure to stock all consumables into 99 in both your inventory  _and_ bottomless box. Make sure that you farm for healing items, specifically Divine Blessings as they nullify all status effects and fully restore health; they're essentially a better version of the Estus Flask.
      * If you want to skip the four Old Ones, farm the [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord") in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). He can provide upwards of 400,000 souls if you wear all possible soul-increasing gear; his arena provides Divine Blessing, and his Great Soul is worth a lot of souls as well; consuming all the collected souls from him in your next cycle seriously boosts your Soul Memory and can help you open the Shrine of Winter early.
      * The four Old Ones themselves are excellent farming targets as well;  _they drop both their soul and an Old Soul as well._ Consume both souls of each of the four bosses in your next cycle and you can easily hit the 1,000,000 SM mark.
      * For Casters: raise your Soul Level to at lease 300; invest in Vigor, Vitality, Attunement, Intelligence, Faith, Adaptability to around 50-99 and plug Strength and Dexterity to their lowest with the help of Soul Vessel. Carry only [Dark Hail](/Dark+Hail "Dark Souls 2 Dark Hail") or [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Great Resonant Soul"), Dark [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff") +5, Dark [Witchtree Branch](/Witchtree+Branch "Dark Souls 2 Witchtree Branch") +10 or Dark [Caitha's Chime](/Caitha%27s+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Caitha%27s Chime") +10.
      * Be sure to use Amber Herb, Repair Powder and Divine's Blessing wisely since you can no longer restock [Estus Flask](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask") until you defeat [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") and the credits roll.
      * The [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King+helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King helm") also restores spell uses.
      * Since one of the rings requires you  _not_ to rest at a bonfire, stock up on Amber Herbs, Twilight Herbs, and Wilted Dusk Herbs and equip the sorcery [Repair](/Repair "Dark Souls 2 Repair"), regardless of your build. Also stock up on 99 Repair Powder from Chancellor Wellager.
      * Be sure to also bring in 4-5 maxed out armor sets, including special sets that specifically reduce certain damage (i.e. bring Straid's set for max magic reduction, Smelter set for max fire reduction, etc.) so that you are ready for every area of the game.
      * There is no turning back, it only gets harder and harder from here; do it in one shot!
      * Alternately, [Santier's Spear](/Santier%27s+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Santier%27s Spear") has infinite durability.

###  Changes from Dark Souls 1

    * The game will not automatically start the next playthrough once the final boss is defeated, you can start NG+ from the bonfire in Majula.
    * The enemies don't just get stronger; more of them will spawn, including some new enemies, particularly more NPC black phantom versions, and a few boss fights are slightly altered.
    * There are new items exclusive to NG+ and beyond, such as higher level rings.
    * Sins committed carry on to NG+ rather than set to no sins.

### Preparing for NG+

  * Buy any items you want from merchants, particularly late game ones as you won't be able to access them until you reach that point in NG+. Your shopping list would look like this: 
    * 999 arrows of your favorite kinds from the different merchants you have unlocked.
    * 99 Amber Herbs, Green Blossoms, and Flame Butterflies from [Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex") (won't sell unlimited until you finish the game again).
    * All the Titanite you can carry from [Stone Trader Chloanne](/Stone+Trader+Chloanne "Dark Souls 2 Stone Trader Chloanne") in Majula.
    * Poison items from Gavlaan in Doors of Pharros.
    * All limited and useful items like Human Effigies, Radiant Lifegems, Twilight Herbs, Bonfire Ascetics, and so on since they will be reset when you start again.
    * Tip: Use your item box to store an additional 99 or 999 of any arrow type, Titanite, or consumable item(s).
    * Trade stones with [Dyna and Tillo](/Dyna+and+Tillo "Dark Souls 2 Dyna and Tillo") for helpful items.

  * Trade any leftover [boss souls](/Boss+Souls "Dark Souls 2 Boss Souls") with [Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex") and [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis") for [boss soul weapons](/Boss+Soul+Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Boss Soul Weapons").
  * (Optional) Kill any [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") from whom you never received their items the normal way. **Note:** Sin carries over into NG+, so if you don't want to be invaded by many blue phantoms, refrain from going on a total killing spree. 
    * Arbiter Spirits will invade you and attempt to kill you but, with each time you get killed, they lower your sin level at a rate of -1 "sin" per death, down to a minimum of 9 (the point where you are no longer a "sinner" and blues may no longer invade you).
    * Absolving Sin via [Cromwell the Pardoner](/Cromwell+the+Pardoner "Dark Souls 2 Cromwell the Pardoner") only resets NPC hostility towards you if you attacked them but didn't kill them. Contrary to popular opinion this will **NOT** reset your Sinner status.

  * Farm for [Titanite](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores") and any other items you might need.
  * [Upgrade](/Upgrades "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades") all your main weapons to max level, since enemies in NG+ have more health and hit for more damage. Upgrading your armor is also advisable, though not incredibly helpful.
  * Infuse any weapons you will need at MacDuff before you have to find the [Dull Ember](/Dull+Ember "Dark Souls 2 Dull Ember") again.
  * Find and use any leftover Estus Flask Shards and Sublime Bone Dust. The max amount of flasks is 12 and the max flask level is +5. If you miss some, don't worry, since they will respawn in NG+.
  * Kill any optional bosses you may have missed, such as [Darklurker](/Darklurker "Dark Souls 2 Darklurker"), [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon#.UzxNBnlOXIU "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon#.UzxNBnlOXIU"), [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") or the [Royal Rat Authority](/Royal+Rat+Authority "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Authority"). 
    * After killing Vendrick, get the [King's Set](/King%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Set") and his soul from the Shrine of Amana.
    * Killing the [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon") isn't necessary to get any rare items or achievements, so he can be safely left alone if he proves too difficult. However, you should get the real [Ancient Dragon Soul](/Ancient+Dragon+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon Soul") from the [Dragon Memories](/Dragon+Memories "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Memories").

  * Find and kill any remaining [Crystal Lizards](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard") as they yield useful and rare ore.
  * You can save some dropped souls (like [Soul of a Great Hero](/Soul+of+a+Great+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Great Hero"), [Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Brave Warrior"), etc.) in order to use them in NG+ to access more powerful weapons/spells faster.
  * The Ruin Armor set dropped by the Ruin Sentinels inside Drangleic Castle can only effectively be farmed in your first playthrough, as they have very limited (if not zero) respawns in NG+.
  * Get [Manslayer](/Manslayer "Dark Souls 2 Manslayer") from Shrine of Amana. This will require completing the [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito") quest line if you haven't already.
  * Collect [Seed of a Tree of Giants](/Seed+of+a+Tree+of+Giants#.U1ltCfldWAs "Dark Souls 2 Seed of a Tree of Giants#.U1ltCfldWAs") if you haven't already.
  * Spend 16k souls at [Maughlin the Armorer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") and buy any boss armor useful to you.
  * Search and kill all torch-wielding Hollows to maximize your torch time for NG+ (Huntsman Copse(1), The Gutter(3), Brightstone Cove Tseldora(2 torch-wielding pawns) & Undead Crypt(1))
  * If you have used Bonfire Ascetics, clear the area for items one last time if you haven't done so already.
  * Downgrade your spell or miracle requirements with [Magerold](/Magerold+of+Lanafir "Dark Souls 2 Magerold of Lanafir") in Iron Keep.
  * Speak with [Cale the Cartographer](/Cale+the+Cartographer "Dark Souls 2 Cale the Cartographer") in his mansion to receive his gear.
  * Complete [Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan")'s quest line if you didn't release him earlier. Have the [Ladder Miniature](/Ladder+Miniature "Dark Souls 2 Ladder Miniature"), [Cale's Helm](/Cale%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Cale%27s Set"), the [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff"), and the [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") in your inventory. Navlaan will give you a few spells and sell you some useful items.
  * Assuming you've got the [King's Ring](/King%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Ring"), go back to [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne") and collect all his gear and [Darkdrift](/Darkdrift "Dark Souls 2 Darkdrift").
  * Assuming you've got the [King's Ring](/King%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Ring"), go back to [Strowen](/Strowen "Dark Souls 2 Strowen") (stat reallocation Firekeeper) and talk to her for [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") x6.

  * Keep in mind that for a no bonfire run, you can light the bonfire but you don't have to rest at it. This way you'll respawn at the last bonfire lit if you die.  _Additionally from here, be careful of which bonfires you decide to light_. If you get all the way to the end of the Undead Crypt and activate the second bonfire before the Velstadt fight, you will then be forced to slog your way back across the Undead Crypt, Shrine of Amana, Drangleic Castle, and Shrine of Winter before finally reaching the Shaded Woods to light a fire in Aldia's Keep. You may also want to be careful of lighting the bonfire underneath Drangleic Castle, as you will be able to light it later in order to have a respawn point for the final boss if necessary. Skipping bonfires may be a good idea, as that way when you're backtracking you will still have a bonfire to light, and will be a little closer to your respawn point if necessary.

The spirit wields [Drakekeeper Warpick](/Drakekeeper's+Warpick "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper's Warpick") and uses it to perform a highly-damaging roundhouse attack. Call it a cheat, but bow and magic work best since he has no shield.
  2. Twin [Pursuers](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer"): throne room, formerly empty, is now heavily guarded. Bring [Bashful Ray](/Bashful+Ray "Dark Souls 2 Bashful Ray") from the storage below to even the odds. The trick with getting cursed by one Pursuer to distract the other and make him disappear until next time bonfire is used no longer works.
  3. Dark spirit [Heavy Knight](/Washing+Pole+Phantom+Description "Dark Souls 2 Washing Pole Phantom Description") (washing pole): found next to Embedded Cell, on top of a looong elevator shaft.

  2. Dark spirit [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") (axe): open area past 2nd [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol").
  3. Dark spirit Rogue: ladders past small powder storage, floor with a wooden chest. The spirit likes to throw knives from a distance, but doesn't pose much of a threat. All such spirits respawn like regular enemies.
  4. Dark spirit [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") x2 (axe / halberd): Upper Floor bonfire, right path, hit the door with a heavy weapon to blast the barrels and unlock upper exit to arena – in addition to regular "bomber" Ashen Warrior, there will be 2 dark spirits.
  5. Dark spirit Rogue: cliffside path past the arena. Dark spirit joins [Fume Sorcerers](/Fume+Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sorcerer") and Ashen Warriors at the exit to Foyer bonfire.
  6. Dark spirit [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") (halberd): at the bridge leading to the elevator descending to Lowermost Floor bonfire.
  7. Dark spirit Rogue x2: a storage with cursing [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol") right next to [Scorching Iron Scepter](/Scorching+Iron+Scepter "Dark Souls 2 Scorching Iron Scepter") pedestal. Wasn't enough trouble there before.

  2. Dark spirits [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor"), [Astrologist](/Astrologist "Dark Souls 2 Astrologist") and [Iron Warrior](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior"): all in the last cave before the boss ([Aged Smelter Demon](/\(Blue\)+Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 \(Blue\) Smelter Demon")), in addition to the same set of regular enemies. It's hell: Astrologists heal both regular and dark spirit Iron Warriors, so either divide and conquer (from the distance, with bow or magic) or rush straight through to the boss (if Astrologists don't slow you down with their spells).
