### Milibeth Encounters in Dark Souls 2

You can find Milibeth in the hut with three Firekeepers in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt"). Attacking and killing any of the retired Fire-keepers will render them useless, even **Milibeth**. [Strowen](/Strowen "Dark Souls 2 Strowen") will NOT be able to use your [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel") to reallocate a character's soul levels. However, if you decide to kill them you can sacrifice souls to their gravestones outside the hut. Doing so will allow you to further speak with the NPCs' spirits and continue to use the Soul Vessel. The two firekeepers and Milibeth cost 1,000 souls and Strowen costs 15,000 souls. Their spirits will fade if you leave the area.

### Milibeth Dialogue in Dark Souls 2

**\- When first met**  
 _This is a limbo. A link between Drangleic and the outer world._  
_Fair traveller, I know that you must have a story._  
_Why else would you visit such a place?_  
_This lost, decayed kingdom_.

**\- When talking a second time**  
 _My name is Milibeth._  
_The old women were once Fire Keepers._  
_I am here to look after them._  
_It is what my mother did, and her mother before her, and so on_.

**\- When talking a third time**  
 _The old women were keepers of the fire._  
_But now, the fire shows signs of fading…_  
 _And the kingdom…is beset by Hollows…_

**\- When talking a fourth time**  
 _The old women are sisters. I am told there was a fourth._  
_They have looked like that for as long as I have known them._  
_Long ago, Fire Keepers were commonplace._  
_But now they are lost, scattered to the winds._

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
 _You have proven yourself to the forest._  
_We have little to offer, except perhaps these._  
_May they bring fortune to your journey, in some small way_.

**\- When attacked but not aggroed**  
 _You brute!_  
_(or)_
