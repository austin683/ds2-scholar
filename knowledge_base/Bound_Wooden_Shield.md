**Bound Wooden Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing. 

     _"A shield with an unusual design. Found in the Undead Purgatory.  
The chains and spikes wrapped around the shield cause bleeding, but weaken the shield's effectiveness._

     _Accessories that are added to a weapon for the sole purpose of  
tormenting foes can often detract from the weapon's natural effectiveness."_

### Acquired From:

  * Pre-order bonus or Black Armor Edition.
  * Can also be bought from [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle").

### Bound Wooden Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Since bashing with this shield can cause bleeding, Bleed Stone works well on this shield on raising both Bleeding build up and resistance, despite not completely resistant.
