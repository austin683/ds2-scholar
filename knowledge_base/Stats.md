**Stats and Attributes** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are important factors to remember when leveling up your character. There are 9 different **Attributes** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** , as well as several dozen secondary stats which will all contribute to your character's growth and effectiveness in various situations. As you progress and level up your character, you are given a chance to upgrade a primary **Attribute** with one point. This page covers all of the **Stats and Attributes** that you'll be using in [Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki").

## Attributes and Stats in Dark Souls 2

When you level up in Dark Souls II you increase an attribute by one point. Attributes like [Strength](/Strength "Dark Souls 2 Strength") and [Dexterity](/Dexterity "Dark Souls 2 Dexterity") determine what armors and weapons can be equipped, while attributes like [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith") and [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") govern what [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic") can be [attuned](/Attunement "Dark Souls 2 Attunement") (excluding [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies")). Some weapons and armor also require a certain amount of Faith and/or Intelligence to function properly. [Vigor](/Vigor "Dark Souls 2 Vigor"), [Vitality](/Vitality "Dark Souls 2 Vitality"), [Endurance](/Endurance "Dark Souls 2 Endurance"), [Attunement](/Attunement "Dark Souls 2 Attunement"), and [Adaptability](/Adaptability "Dark Souls 2 Adaptability") mainly function to increase a specific stat. However, **all** attributes affect several different stats.

  * See [Status Effects](/Status+Effects "Dark Souls 2 Status Effects") for information about debuffs and their effects on various stats. 
  * See [Stat Calculators](/Stat+Calculators "Dark Souls 2 Stat Calculators") for leveling and agility calculators.
