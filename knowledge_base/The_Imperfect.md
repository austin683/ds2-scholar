**The Imperfect** is an [enemy](/enemies "Dark Souls 2 enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. In the Sunken City dwell **The Imperfect** , malformed beings that seem to be a distorted offshoot of dragon-kind. Although, at a glance, they share only a faint resemblance to those majestic creatures. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### DKS2 The Imperfect Strategy Tips

  * In higher NG cycles they can be a real pain. I found the best way of dealing with them goes as follows. They are weak to strike damage so equip a great hammer (I powerstanced a [Large Club](/Large+Club "Dark Souls 2 Large Club") +10 and an [Old Knight Hammer](/Old+Knight+Hammer "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight Hammer") +10 in NG++) for maximum damage output. Use ranged attacks to aggro one to draw him away from the rest. They will generally go for one or two ranged attacks, depending on their distance from you. If you time your roll right, you can roll straight through the orb spit. Rolling to the side or strafing will take of a chunk out of your health due to the splash damage and slight tracking of this attack. Their next step is generally the Dashing ram. Roll to your left to negate this attack. They can also approach the player by leaping in your direction. Just roll back, you should be fine. The best place to be is right in front of them. Standing under it will cause it to perform a leap attack, wich is hard to dodge. Stand in front of their nose and strafe to your left. The sideward bite goes from your left to your right, and if you continue strafing it will miss you. This is the time to attack. Watch out for a follow up sideward bite in opposite direction. Once you get one or two hits in, get back in front of it. The overhead bite can be rolled through. Standing behind or to the side of it will cause it to stomp. The stomp has a small AoE, so watch out or you will be staggerd. During the stomp animation they take little damage (208 instead of the usual 1044 at 50 Str 40 Dex on NG++ with previously mentioned weapons). Staying in front of it and strafing usually only triggers the bite attacks, which are easily dodged. Repeat this and you should have no trouble with them.  
You can also deal with them by running to the beach and using ranged attacks. Watch out for their orb spit though.
  * They're generally weak to [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Great Resonant Soul").  
Kite them to the island/beach, they cannot leave the pool.
  * Can be poisoned with ~10 Poison Arrows, when you start to see their HP meter drain with poisoning switch to Regular Arrows until they're down.
