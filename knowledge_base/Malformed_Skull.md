The **Malformed Skull** in Dark Souls 2 is a unique [Great Hammer](/Great+Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Great Hammers") fashioned from the skull of an unidentified creature, possibly a dragon.

### Dark Souls 2 Malformed Skull Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite"). Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * Weapon only has 20 durability and will break quickly. [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring") +2 is recommended.
  * This weapon is ideal Raw as it has no scaling at all.
  * As it only requires 17 Str and 7 Dex to two-hand, this allows plenty of points to be sunk into Vit, End, Vig, and Adp while still maintaining huge damage output.
  * Minimum power stance requirement is 53 Str and 11 Dex, under Raw infusion, [Ring of Blades](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades") +2 and fully upgraded both hammers, it inflicts 1919 damage at max for powerstance strong attack.
