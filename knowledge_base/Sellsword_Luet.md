Tips

  * When summoned, he greets you with the "Warcry" gesture.
  * He is primarily a tank used for distracting enemies.
  * He bashes with his greatshields, but two-hands one of them and stops attacking when below half health.
  * He breaks boss poise easily, so it's possible that he has the Stone Ring equipped.

    | Forest of Fallen Giants | His sign is right before the Last Giant boss room, and since he is a shade, he can also be summoned to help you in the fire pit. He will not follow you up the elevator. |
    | Sinners' Rise | In the final cell in the right hand upper floor. |
