**Rebel's Greatshield** is a [Greatshield](/Greatshields "Dark Souls 2 Greatshields") in Dark Souls 2. **Greatshields** can be used not only to block an enemy but allows player to do **shield bash**(Great shields replaced parry ability with heavy shield bash).

     _"Shield of the rebel Raime._

     _Raime, and Velstadt were known as the left- and right-arms of the King,  
until their wills clashed, and Raime was deemed a traitor._

     _The black raven is despised as an augur of death, but it was Raime's favorite bird."_

### Acquired From

  * Treasure pickup guarded by the fire-breathing Salamander in the cave at the bottom of the gulch in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants").

### Rebel's Greatshield Hints and Tips

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Statistically, this is the **best** shield in the game. It's total resistances are **higher than any other shield (90% for each element),** and infusing it with any elemental ore will give it **100% resistance** to that element, while still retaining very high stats overall. Unfortunately it has the lowest phys. protection of all greatshields, and even the average small shield. Therefore it is best used in conjunction with a lighter 100% phys. shield (i.e. Royal Kite, Drangleic)
  * This shield was chosen to be in the game as one of the winners of the Shield Design Contest held by Bandai Namco and FromSoftware.
