### Notes

### Lord's Private Chamber Walkthrough

### Last Gen

Entering the room, you'll notice the [Tseldoran Settler](/Tseldoran+Settler "Dark Souls 2 Tseldoran Settler") (Duke Tseldora) sitting at a table. Killing him will grant you the [Brightstone Key](/Brightstone+Key "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Key"), a [Fragrant Branch Of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+Of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch Of Yore"), and a [Dark Quartz Ring+1](/Dark+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Dark Quartz Ring").

Down the stairs to the right you'll find a Primal Bonfire, but careful as it is guarded by [Vengarl](/Head+of+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Head of Vengarl")'s Body, which you can defeat to receive [Vengarl's armor set](/Vengarl%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Vengarl%27s Set"); defeating his body also allows you to return to [Headless Vengarl](/Headless+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Headless Vengarl"), exhaust his dialogue, and have him as you ally in multiple, upcoming boss fights.
