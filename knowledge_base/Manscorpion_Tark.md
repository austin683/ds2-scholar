### Manscorpion Tark Encounters in Dark Souls 2

[Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"). From the Shaded Ruins bonfire, proceed straight ahead to the end of the bridge, then head left through the open doorway and climb the hill. Nearby to the left you will see a two storey ruined building, with cursed jars on both floors and in the basement. Clear the jars and head through the basement to a tunnel, which will take you to the room containing Tark.

Alternate route: Requres 2x [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore"). From the Shaded Ruins bonfire, climb the ramp next to the bonfire and turn 180 degrees so the player is facing the length of the bridge. Towards the left, the player can jump off, which will land them on a broken bridge. Proceed until finding a Lion Warrior statue - unpetrify it with the branch, then proceed past him to find the [Body of Vengarl](/Headless+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Headless Vengarl"). After killing Vengarl, you will find a second Lion Warrior statue to unpetrify, which will open the way to Tark's room. This is much less dangerous than the other route as it allows the player to avoid any cursed jars, however this is also not an optimal use of Fragrant Branches, depending on the player's progression.

Note that summoning him as a Phantom removes him from his spawn location. Resting at a Bonfire will cause him to reappear.

### Manscorpion Tark Dialogue in Dark Souls 2 

**\- When attempting to speak to him without the[Ring of Whispers](/Ring+of+Whispers "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Whispers") equipped****  
**…?

**\- When speaking to him for the first time with the[Ring of Whispers](/Ring+of+Whispers "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Whispers") on**  
Human, are we?  
This is no place for you. Be gone.

**\- When speaking the second time****  
**Are you not afraid of me?  
Humans rarely come here.  
Those who do turn back when they see me.   
Or make an attempt on my life.  
But you, heh…are different.

**\- When speaking the third time**  
We once had a master. He created us long, long ago.  
But he was born with a fatal flaw.  
He resented those who had what he lacked, and became fully mired in hatred.  
Eventually, he drove himself mad.  
It was at the peak of this madness that he conjured up we strange creatures.

**\- When speaking the fourth time**  
Our master was a tragically lonely soul.  
Eventually, his solitude eroded his very reason.  
In the end, he never understood…  
…what it was that he truly lacked.

**\- When speaking the fifth time**  
Nobody knows when we were born.  
Or where our master has gone.  
The only ones who even speak a human tongue are myself and my better half.

**\- When speaking the sixth time  
** I wish to ask a favour of you. I want you to kill my betrothed.  
Once, I always found her at my side. But as time went on, things went awry.  
She became violent, raging uncontrollably.  
Eventually she came after me.  
And we've been locked in combat ever since.

**\- When speaking to him the seventh time**  
We seem to be at a standstill. The wounds we exchange are never lethal.  
I was born of my master's madness. Perhaps this is some curse.  
I will be sure to assist you in return.

**\- When speaking the eight time**  
The past is a distant fog…  
My name was Tark… That is all that I remember…

**\- When speaking to him after defeating[Scorpioness Najka](/Scorpioness+Najka "Dark Souls 2 Scorpioness Najka")**  
You've defeated my better half.  
This is my thanks. Take it.

**\- When speaking to him after defeating Najka**  
Long ago, there was a being with powers similar to ours.  
The creature took the form of a spider.  
But I don't know where it disappeared to.  
Perhaps it was seduced by madness.

**\- When speaking to him after defeating[The Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke's+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke's Dear Freja")**  
What skill. You've defeated my master.  
But our master never dies, only changes form, so that he may seethe for all eternity.  
Brave human, you have yet to face your greatest perils.  
Take these. May joy await you at the end of your travels.

**\- When speaking to him after defeating The Duke's Dear Freja and for future encounters**  
I have no gods to pray to.  
But still I pray that your journey will be safe.

**When attacked but not aggroed**  
Hrgkt! (no caption)  
What are you doing!-

**When attacked and aggroed**  
Have you been enslaved by madness?

**\- When attacked and health is under 50%**  
You wretched human!

**\- When killing the player**  
Foolish human…

**\- When rencountered after defeat**  
The mad will never be forgiven.

**\- When killed**  
Arrggh... (no caption)
