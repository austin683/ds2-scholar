### Children of Dark Lore

The old one of the Abyss ([Manus, Father of the Abyss](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Manus,+Father+of+the+Abyss "Dark Souls 2 Manus, Father of the Abyss")) was reborn in death, his soul split into miniscule fragments, and spread across the land. The pieces began to coalesce again, becoming human in shape. After regaining their shapes, they crawled forth yearning for strong souls, in search of greater power. They courted monarchs of considerable power, which they desired to make their own. The fragments of the abyss, of untold origin, nourished their beings by the sides of would-be monarchs. Perhaps they were simply ordeals on the way to kinghood. One day, the flames will fade, and only darkness will remain. Unless, of course, an heir arrives. Light and Dark are two sides of the same coin, much like the soul and the curse. In this way the beings who presented themselves to those in search of kinghood were drawn to their awesome strength. The tiniest of these pieces, precisely due to its size, was the first to restore its form. Sensing its own fragility, it yearned for what it lacked. [Queen Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") of Drangleic was born of the Dark with this insatiable lust for strength. She was an augur of want, who desired the First Flame and the great soul of a worthy king. She likely incited [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") to subdue the Giants and claim their strength, but ultimately Vendrick was unable to claim the true throne.

The sisters of Nashandra went to other lands and clung to other past monarchs. [Elana, the Squalid Queen](/Elana,+Squalid+Queen "Dark Souls 2 Elana, Squalid Queen"), rests beside the sleeping dragon of the Eternal Sanctum. [Shulva, the Sanctum City](/Shulva+-+Sanctum+City "Dark Souls 2 Shulva - Sanctum City") fell due to the invasion of the [drakeblood knights](/Black+Drakeblood+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Black Drakeblood Knight") and awakening of [Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon](/Sinh,+the+Slumbering+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon"), and the vile poison it spewed forth. It is very likely that the king of Shulva was consumed by the dragon. Elana slowly amasses souls in anticipation of the coming day of vengeance. She was an augur of wrath, and the emotions embodied by the children of dark perhaps hinted at humanity's true nature. When Nadalia came to a foreign land, the king she sought was no longer there. Dispirited, she forsook her own soul and clung to the heirlooms of the old king. In the act of dancing, the Bride of Ash was transfigured as smoke, enticing people to her residence. And so her seat of power came to be known as the [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower"). She was an augur of solitude, and bore inconceivable strength. The rebel [Raime](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight"), after his defeat by [Velstadt](/Velstadt,+the+Royal+Aegis "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt, the Royal Aegis"), came to Brume Tower in search of greater strength. When he found it, it came not from a regal father like before, but from a newfound mother, who gave him true purpose. The exile swordsman Raime had the ability to expunge the black fog, but chose instead to live alongside it, in the company of the child of Dark Nadalia. The enigmatic Alsanna quietly found a place at the Ivory King's side, and when his strength was fully drained, he conferred this sword inscribed with the name of Eleum Loyce, to her. This child of Dark, in reverence of the apocalypse, devotes herself to a ritual in hopes of appeasing the raging flame of the Old Chaos. She was an augur of fear, and yet her lord was able to provide her comfort before resigning himself to the flames of chaos.

### Dialogue Related to Children of Dark

#### [Nashandra, Queen of Drangleic](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra")

_You have fought admirably on your journey, cursed Undead. I am Nashandra, Queen of Drangleic._

_A true monarch is much more than a ruler of men. A true monarch carries the weight of their souls. The last king of this land, King Vendrick, as he was called... He found the strength to rule his people, and when the undead were born, cursed... He found more strength, to face them. But in the end, he never took the true throne._

_Visit Vendrick. We have no need for two rulers..._

_Drangleic is no longer. Brave Undead, seek the throne. Follow the symbol of the monarch, and do what must be done._

_Seek the forest, you, where those wretched Giants slumber._

_Brave Undead, you have proven yourself to me. Now, be one, with the Dark..._

#### [Vendrick, King of Drangleic](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick")

_Seeker of fire, coveter of the throne. I am Vendrick, ruler of Drangleic._

_I am king of this wretched, unravelled kingdom. I subdued the Giants, and claimed their strength. So that I might step closer to fire... Drangleic will fall, the fire will fade, and the souls of old will reemerge. With Dark unshackled, a curse will be upon us... And men will take their true shape..._

_Seeker of fire, I see you've subdued another foul creature. One of the Father of the Abyss' spawn, that confounded quintessence of humanity. The Abyss once had form, but then dissipated. And yet, traces of its existence endured. Each fragment, thirsting for power, spread Dark, with no relent. My dear Shandra... was one such fragment. A feeble, tiny thing that thirsted for power more than any other. Driven by insatiable lust for a worthy vessel._

_Fire came to be, and with it, Disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, Light and Dark._

_Dark was seen as a curse. Shadow is not cast, but born of fire. And, the brighter the flame, the deeper the shadow. Inherit fire, and harness the Dark. Such is the calling of a true leader..._

_One day, fire will fade, and Dark will become a curse. Men will be free from death, left to wander eternally. Dark will again be ours, and in our true shape... We can bury the false legends of yore... Only... Is this our only choice? Seeker of fire, coveter of the throne. Seek strength. The rest will follow..._

#### [Alsanna, Silent Oracle](/Alsanna,+Silent+Oracle "Dark Souls 2 Alsanna, Silent Oracle")

_I have but one wish. That my dear Lord might be freed from that unspeakable Chaos. I haven't the strength to help him myself, but perhaps one such as you... Though yet I am yet to know your name, stranger, will you lend me your strength?_

_You've granted my one wish... Now, I have no regrets. I was born amidst the Dark. Long ago, in the depths of the Abyss, my Father perished. The Dark shattered into tiny pieces, one of which was me. How frightened I was. A frail thing, born from but a splinter of Dark. I felt that I might simply disappear._

_I am, in fact, the incarnation of my Father's fears. I sought an anchor, and I saw that a King of this land was strong. I sought him only to sustain myself, to smother my fears... Now, I realize that he may have known all along. I was born of fear, and my Lord provided comfort. And so here I remain, heiress to my Lord's wishes, watching over Chaos... until the end of time. ...until I wither away._

_The beings born from the shards of Dark... I am not the only one. Even Dark seeks solace, and more so, souls. Magnificent souls... like your own... One day, you may encounter another. Another being, born of Dark._

_Kind visitor. I am not the only being born of Dark. You will face hardships like no other. Take this. My sisters are as a thick Dark, their lust for souls insatiable... May you find the will to resist their desires..._
