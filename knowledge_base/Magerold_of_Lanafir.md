### Magerold of Lanafir Dialogue

**\- First Encounter**  
What? Who're you?  
Who, me? I'm Magerold, who else?  
What? Have a look at my wares.

**\- Return Encounters**  
Finally decided to come and visit?  
(or)  
Well? Where've you been?

**\- Speaking to again**  
What? You again?  
(or)  
You've quite unusual taste, don't you?

**\- Using Talk Option**  
I'm mainly a treasure hunter, you see. I'm only a merchant on the side.  
I roam about, looking for a find, following my instincts.  
I don't care what a thing is worth. What matters is whether it grabs me.  
Do I enjoy what I do? Well…That's a good question.  
But I suppose I must, I…I've been doing it for ages.

**\- Using Talk Option**  
There's good iron in these parts. An old king even used it to build a castle.  
But the thing was too heavy, and it slowly sank into the ground.  
Fires spouted from the earth, and…and the place turned into this.  
At least, that's what I'm told. Not a bad story, eh?  
So, what'll it be? Anything for you today?

**\- Using Talk Option**  
Hey, You know that odd fellow? With the hulking blue sword.  
He talks really highly of it, but I got a feeling it's a fake.  
I didn't want to disappoint him, so I just sort of talked around it.  
Let me just say, there are lots of "legendary swords" out there.

**\- Using Talk Option**  
Have you heard of the shrine on the eastern edge of Drangleic?  
Built to honour the dragons, they say.  
If only I knew how to get there, I'd go and I'd comb it for goodies.

**\- After paying 10,000 souls**  
I think we have similar taste. Really I do.  
Here, you should like these.

**\- Returning with Petrified Egg**  
What is that? A petrified egg?  
From the shrine? Fantastic…  
Might…might you give it to me?  
I'm fascinated by it…I'm begging you.

  1. **Answering "YES"**  
How very kind of you.  
This thing is amazing… Could it be a dragon egg?  
I feel invigorated… Just by holding it.
  2. **Answering "NO"**  
Oh no, no, no, no, no, don't say that. Give a bloke a chance.  
I'm begging you. I really should have that!
  3. **Speaking to again**  
Oh, change your mind?  
Donating your stone egg after all?

**\- Leaving after using his services**  
Cheers!

**\- Leaving without using his services**  
Very well, no pressure.

**\- Leaving without exiting the menu**  
Hey? Where you off to?

**\- When attacked**  
 _Ow!_ (no caption)  
But…what's the meaning of this! (aggroed)  
What…what…what the devil! (50% HP)

**\- When killing the player**  
You're a rotten bugger.

**\- Returning after defeat**  
Ohh, just…just stay away, will you?

**\- When killed by the player**  
 _dying groan_ (no caption)
