### Black Witch Trousers Description

_"Trousers worn by Zullie the Witch, seducer of Alva the Wayfarer. Boasts excellent magic defense._

_When Zullie the Witch learned of Alva's dedication to Saint Serreta, she used all manner of tricks and deceit to ruin him, but in the end she would spend her life with him, supporting his endeavors._

_The witch, as unloving as she was unloved, finally found illumination through her blighted existence."_
