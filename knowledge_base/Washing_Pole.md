**Washing Pole is a[Katana](/Katanas "Dark Souls 2 Katanas") **and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Washing Pole **boasts the longest katana blade but comes with very low durability. It consumes more stamina than other katanas and has lower counter damage to balance its extensive reach.

> A katana of unknown origin. Crafted with a peculiar yet refined technique. The extremely long blade allows for strikes from great distance, but its construction makes it extremely fragile. 

### How to get Washing Pole in Dark Souls 2

  * [Dragon Shrine (Chest)](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine") ([Mimic](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic")) You can acquire this in any NG, if you do not receive it try using a bonfire ascetic and keep trying until the mimic drops the washing pole. It also drops [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") x1 & [Petrified Something](/Petrified+Something "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Something") x1.
  * Does not respawn a duplicate within the same NG if you already acquired [Washing Pole](/Washing+Pole "Dark Souls 2 Washing Pole").
  * From killing the two [Pursuers](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") in the Drangleic Castle Throne Room at NG++. This can also be done using bonfire ascetics.
  * In SOTFS, there are two locations you can get it. One is from a mimic chest in drangleic castle, in the same room with the 2 headed horse. The other is in Harvest Valley just before the Earthen Peak entrance, in the poison mist on the far right side.

### DS2 Washing Pole Hints and Tips

  * Has the longest blade of all Katanas but suffers from very low durability (20).
  * Consumes noticeably more stamina than other katanas.
  * Has lower counter damage than most katanas to offset its tremendous reach.
  * The Washing Pole is slower than other katanas, but only in some areas. The very first R1\RB attack that you throw will be slightly slower when compared to other katanas. In addition, the R2\RT attacks are noticeably slower when two-handing.
  * The Washing Pole has vastly lower directional adjustment compared to other katanas in regards to its 2-handed strong attacks.

  
Notes:

  * The Washing Pole may be a reference to "Monohoshi Zao" (The Laundry-Drying Pole), a nodachi used by the prominent Japanese swordsman Sasaki Kojirō who lived during the Sengoku period.
  * Also modeled after Nodachi (Wild Tachi), a historical katana-type sword (or technically, Tachi) with extended blade, in the size of a greatsword. In certain non english versions of the game, "Nodachi" is the name of this weapon in game.
