**Black Boots** is a **Legging** and a part of [Black Set](/Black+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Black Boots Description

"Boots Belonged to Straid of Olaphis.  
Straid was invited to the old kingdom of Olaphis for his wisdom, but its depth was such that people soon feared him, and in the end Straid was led into a dreadful trap.  
Straid spent several lifetimes as stone. During this hiatus, kingdoms rose and fell, until the land called Drangleic came to be."

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Obtained from [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis) by trading him 4 boss souls and speaking to him.
  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia) in [Majula](/Majula) if you killed Straid. Progress through story

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite)
  * The hood improves casting speed, gives +2 intelligence and +2 faith.
  * 16 intelligence required
  * Oddly, this set was designed for Dual Swordman class in Dark Souls 2 beta, it is now a sorcerer's equipment.
