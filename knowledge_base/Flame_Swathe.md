**Flame Swathe** is a [Pyromancy](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Flame Swathe** , a pyromancy crafted by Straid, the eminent mage of ancient Olaphis. Engulfs distant enemies in powerful flames, consuming them in searing fire. [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") are offensive fire spells that do not demand [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith") or [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") prerequisites and can be executed with a [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") or [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame"). The fire damage scales with [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"), yet there are no specific stat requirements for casting pyromancies. However, opponents resistant to fire damage remain unaffected by [Pyromancy Spells](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies").

> Great flames envelop and immolate faraway foes.  
>   
> Straid, always immersed in magic, never accepted an apprentice.  
> As a result, much of his extensive knowledge is permanently lost."

### Flame Swathe Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Great spell in PVP thanks to its range, large blast radius, and tricky dodge timing, but the best part of this spell is its sheer damage. With an upgraded pyromancy flame, it's entirely possible to take out full-health enemy players with a single cast. This spell is also very useful in PVE, including boss fights.
  * As of Patch 1.04, the damage of this spell has slightly decreased and the explosion is delayed.
  * Also used by [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress "Dark Souls 2 Desert Sorceress").
