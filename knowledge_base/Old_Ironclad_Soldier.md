### Old Ironclad Soldier Information in Dark Souls 2

_"These are the first really "heavy hitters" you encounter. Knights sent from the Iron King's stronghold to reinforce Drangleic against the marauding giant horde, the Old Ironclads are weathered, weaker versions of their stronger cousins. They are nonetheless formidable, clad in heavy armor resembling a turtle's shell and which provides them with enormous defense. Difficult to stagger, these armored juggernauts carry massive footman's maces designed to smash defenders into paste. Though most of their attacks can be blocked, their swings do enormous stamina drain if defended against with anything less than a greatshield, so dodging them is recommended. They are the only source for the Old Ironclad set. Note that the Ironclads found in[Iron keep](/Iron+keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron keep") are identical, but they have more health, and defense, and cause more damage than their weaker brethren.__"_
