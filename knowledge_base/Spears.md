**Spears** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a type of [Weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") that has longer reach compared to most weapons. Most of its attacks consists of Thrust. The advantage of using Spears is that they have a longer reach, where the player can attack the opponent before they are within the opponent's range. Similar to [Piercing Swords](/Piercing+Swords "Dark Souls 2 Piercing Swords"), the hit impact is relatively small, making it difficult to land a hit against fast and nimble opponents. Spears are best used in narrow and confined areas. With Spears, you can simultaneously attack while guarding with a [Shield](/Shields "Dark Souls 2 Shields"). Spears are also fast and very effective when interrupting enemy attacks. This page covers a list of all Spears in Dark Souls 2.
