**Homeward** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracles.

> "A miracle that returns the caster to the last bonfire rested at. Traditionally, its destination was the caster's homeland.
> 
> The curse slowly erodes one's memory, until even one's birthplace is reduced to a figment of a clouded past. But the bonfires are constant, a beacon for the tragically afflicted."

### Acquired From

  * Purchase from Licia of Lindeldt for 2400 souls.

### Notes

  * A cost-efficient way to quickly return to your last bonfire before obtaining the [Aged Feather.](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") Useful when farming for enemy drops or when attempting to despawn certain enemies from an area.
  * Strangely enough, this spell isn't disabled and instead functions as normal when invaded by an NPC. Scripted invasions will trigger again upon return to their spawn location, while the Forlorns' randomized invasions won't.
