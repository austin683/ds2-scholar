**Attunement** is an [Attribute](/Stats "Dark Souls 2 Stats") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **Attunement** determines your character's attunement slots, casts per spell, and casting speed. Attributes can be increased by assigning points into them when [Leveling Up](/Level "Dark Souls 2 Level").

### Attunement Information

**Attunement** is an attribute governing number of spells that can be attuned. Boosts spell casting speed.

  * **Raises attunement slots:** See table. Maxed at 75.
  * **Raises maximum stored casts:** See table. Starts at 10, max at 94.
  * Raises [Casting speed](/Casting+speed "Dark Souls 2 Casting speed")
  * **Raises curse resistance**
  * Raises [Agility](/Agility "Dark Souls 2 Agility")
  * Slightly increases HP for each point: +2 HP (0-20), +1 HP (21-50), +0 HP (51-99)
  * The Bandit begins with the lowest Attunement at 2 and the Sorcerer starts with the highest Attunement at 12.
  * Each spell seems to get more charges at a particular amount of attunement points based on the amount of casts it starts off with. For example, a spell that starts with 8 casts can rise to a maximum of 15 casts, while a spell with 2 casts can rise to a total of 5.
  * The table below is accurate for **MOST** (~90% of) spells. (pre-SotFS) 
    * This table needs to be updated to reflect the current patch version and/or SotFS edition. Multiple spells show additional casts between lvls 75 and 79. More research necessary.
  * There are multiple soft caps (meaning "the best amount of pts for the value") for attunement: 
    * 20 & 30 are the softcaps for attunement slots; recommended value for using enhancement and/or healing spells (ex: magic barrier, sunlight blade, heal, great heal, etc.).
    * 50 is the softcap for total spell charges added; recommended value for using offensive spells (any spell that directly deals damage like [Soul Arrow](/Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Soul Arrow") & [Lightning Spear](/Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Lightning Spear")
  * There are two items that increase the number of attunement slots separate from the attunement stat. 
    * The [Southern Ritual Band](/Southern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Southern Ritual Band") gives 1, 2, 3 extra slots at +0, +1, and +2.
    * The [Black Witch Hat](/Black+Witch+Hat "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch Hat") gives one additional slot. 
      * Although it has a 20 intelligence requirement, this is only for the defensive stats not the attunement.
  * There are another three items that increase the number of spell charges. 
    * The [Northern Ritual Band](/Northern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Northern Ritual Band") gives 10%, 20%, 30% more casts at +0, +1, and +2.
    * The [Hexer's Hood](/Hexer%27s+Hood "Dark Souls 2 Hexer%27s Hood") provides 10% more casts.
    * The [Saint's Hood](/Saint%27s+Hood "Dark Souls 2 Saint%27s Hood") provides a currently undetermined amount of additional casts.
