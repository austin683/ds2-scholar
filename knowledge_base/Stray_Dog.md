  * Stray Hounds are dogs that have turned hollow. Before the undead curse spread, these animals served some purpose relevant to their locations
  * Stray Hounds have meager HP and damage, but can outrun players and attack in quick succession. They are usually found in packs
  * Stray Hounds will attempt to chase, leap at, and bite their opponents. Their attacks cause bleed buildup, 
  * Stray Hounds, although dangerous head on, are easily taken down when attacking from their flanks. They cannot turn very quickly.
  * Stray Hounds, like most undead, are weak against fire.
