### How to get Caitha's Chime in Dark Souls 2

  * Dropped by Astrologist enemy in Iron Passage.

### DS2 Caitha's Chime Hints and Tips

  * Extremely fast casting speed, but cannot use miracles. This is the best hex-casting chime in the game for casting quickly, but potentially loses out to Chime of Want for total power. Works best when infused with Dark.
  * Upgrades with regular Titanite, making it easier to upgrade than both the Idol's Chime and Chime of Want.
