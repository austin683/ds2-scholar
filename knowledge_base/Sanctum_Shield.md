**Sanctum Shield** is a [small shield](/small+shields "Dark Souls 2 small shields") in Dark Souls 2. **DLC** or Downloadable Content shields cannot be obtained in the original version of the game, Dark Souls 2. It is a unique shield capable of casting [magic](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").

     _"A shield with a curious design. One of the treasures of the Sunken King._

     _A mixture of mystical tree branch and sacred chime iron allows this shield to serve as a catalyst for miracles and sorceries._

     _Most of the miracles and sorceries created in the Sanctum City were lost, but the quality of their armor and shields suggests highly advanced craftsmanship."_

### Acquired From

  * DLC [Crown of the Sunken King](/Crown+of+the+Sunken+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Sunken King"): At the highest level of the [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon's+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon's Sanctum") (pyramid directly across the Priestess' Chamber Bonfire) in an iron chest. Walking across the bridge from the Priestess' Chamber Bonfire and turning to your right, you can find a ladder leading further up the pyramid. Beware the three [Corrosive Egg Crawlers](/Corrosive+Egg+Crawlers "Dark Souls 2 Corrosive Egg Crawlers") in the room with the ladder. Once you have climbed up the ladder you will find an iron chest containing the Sanctum Shield.

### Sanctum Shield Hints and Tips

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Able to cast sorceries and miracles with strong attack; contrary to description, this shield actually **CAN** be used for casting hexes, in the same manner as [Black Witch's Staff](/Black+Witch%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch%27s Staff").
  * Just like the [Disc Chime](/Disc+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Disc Chime") this shield does a lot of damage if used as 2-handed weapon. Unlike disc chime this shield will guard user with 2-handed r1 attack and it can be buffed with strong magic shield. With right usage this can be made into a devastating tool in both PvP and PvE.
  * Alternatively, you can also use the [Repel](/Repel "Dark Souls 2 Repel") spell as an alternate means of parrying, which neglects all attack, as a surprise tactic for countering spells.
