### Creighton's Chain Leggings Description

"Atypical steel mask.  
Belonged to Creighton the Wanderer.  
Its design resembles that of the knight order of the eastern land of Mirrah, but with some odd differences that catch the eye.  
Perhaps it is a finely-crafted imitation."

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Helm from killing [Creighton the Wanderer](/Creighton+the+Wanderer)
  * Chest, **Gloves** , Legs from [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia)
  * You can also obtain his entire armor set by helping him during his fight with Pate.
  * The family crest is same as [Benhart's Set](/Benhart%27s+Set), it's belonged to the knight order in Mirrah, note that this is a replica, while Benhart found the true armor in Mirrah, this explained the origin of Benhart's armor.
