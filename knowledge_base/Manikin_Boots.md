**Manikin Boots** is a **Legging** and a part of [Manikin Set](/Manikin+Set "Dark Souls 2 Manikin Set") in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Manikin Boots Description

"Leggings of the Manikins of Harvest Valley. A fickle queen gave them life and tore off their faces. How else could she forgive those who dared gaze upon her?"

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Drop from Manikin in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak")

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite Shard, Large Titanite Shard, Titanite Chunk, Titanite Slab](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores")
  * From Software had to change the mask design due to legal issues with Naruto (Anime/Manga) Which is probably also why manikins we meet ingame are headless. Maybe Fromsoft had no time or desire to redesign their heads with new mask. (Source needed.) 
    * You can download a mod for the game (on nexusmods) and edit the texture to the same, as it was in the trailer of DarkSoulsII. 
      * Download: (As every texture mod, it requires )
  * Very high physical defense/weight ratio, so very good choice for a lightweight piece of armor if you cannot take on much more weight.
