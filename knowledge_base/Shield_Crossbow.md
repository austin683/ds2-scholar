### DS2 Shield Crossbow Hints and Tips

  * Character is shielded for as long as the attack button is held. The attack may be cancelled by rolling.
  * You can only block one time before you need to raise the crossbow again.
  * Note that holding the attack button with this crossbow takes a large amount of stamina; since the stability of the shield itself is low, be sure not to run out of stamina while blocking.
  * When 2 handing (not dual wielding), you can aim your reticule to fire, as with all the crossbows.
  * This crossbow cannot be power stanced even with two Shield Crossbows.
  * Uses less stamina per shot than the Heavy Crossbow, but has comparable damage and slightly longer range.
  * You can cancel the aiming of any crossbow and attack instead with the weapon held in your other hand, by pressing (Y/Triangle) and immediately following it up with a light or heavy attack.
  * Benefits from Raw infusion since it has no scaling.
