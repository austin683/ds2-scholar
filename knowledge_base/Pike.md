> "A spear with an extended pole. Offers a very long reach, even for a spear, allowing for attacks from safer distances.  
> Traditionally a weapon of regimental rather than single combat due to its unwieldiness. However, if you can manage to effectively step around an opponent, they will hardly have a chance to hit back. "

### **Acquired From**
