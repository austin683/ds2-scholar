**Grave Warden Bottoms** is a **legging** and a part of [Grave Warden Set](/Grave+Warden+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Grave Warden Bottoms Description

_"Leggins worn by wardens of this crypt."  
"The wardens of the crypt watch over the slumbering dead, making sure they are not awoken. Be they king or peasant, wise or dull, rich or poor, the wardens treat them all with the same care."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Dropped by [Grave Warden](/Grave+Warden)

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite Shards, Large Titanite Shards, Titanite Chunks and Titanite Slab](/Ores)
  * The armor is reminiscent of the Ancient Egyptian clothing, which slightly resembles that of the connection between the Grave Wardens and Agdayne, Guardian of the Undead Crypt, because Agdayne wears clothing similar to those found in Ancient Rome, and Ancient Rome expanded its territory into Ancient Egypt during Augustus Caesar's reign.
