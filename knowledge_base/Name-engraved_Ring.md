### DS2 Name-Engraved Ring Tips and Notes in Dark Souls 2 

  * A new god can be chosen upon un-equipping and re-equipping the ring for infinite uses. You can achieve the same effect by selecting the ring in the equip menu, and select "Confirm" on the same ring.
  * While not explicitly stated in the description of the ring, it also makes your summon sign inaccessible to anyone who is wearing the ring and has not chosen the same god as you. This includes NPCs.
  * It also makes players equipped with the same god appear more frequently as ghosts. This can be tested with a friend near a bonfire.

The Name-Engraved Ring increases the timer's starting length by 50%. So the Small White Sign Soapstone has its timer increase from 500 seconds to 750 seconds, and the full White Sign Soapstone goes from 4000 seconds to 6000 seconds. It also increases the timer for the forms of PvP where the ring helps filter signs but doesn't otherwise increase SM ranges-- giving it another affect to those forms of multiplayer that wasn't previously known.
