**Smelter Hammer** is a **[Great Hammer](/Great+Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Great Hammers")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. **Smelter Hammer** is a Great Hammer wielded by the iron warriors in Brume Tower. Originally an axe, it now exists in a melted state, functioning as a massive lump that crushes foes with its weight. It is notably slower and larger than many other Great Hammers. The move-set includes unique attacks, such as a spinning parry animation and a long-distance jump attack for the running attack.

### How to get Smelter Hammer in Dark Souls 2

  * Uncommon/Rare drop from the [Iron Warrior](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior") that wields the weapon itself (Also drops from the Iron Warrior using the bleed mace, such as outside the bonfire near Fume Knight). Encountered several times throughout the [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King") DLC.

### DS2 Smelter Hammer Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite"). Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * The Smelter Hammer is considerably slower in attacking than many other Great Hammers, while also extremely larger than all the other Great Hammers.
  * Despite requiring 70 STR to wield one handed (35 for two handed), you can power stance the Smelter Hammer with 99 STR.
  * In PVP, challenging to dodge without a high AGL value as the hit box is enormous.
  * The two-handed parry animation is replaced with a spin attack where the player rotates completely around twice then hurls themselves as a missile; most of the damage comes from the missile part of the attack.
  * The running attack, both one and two-handed are unique. A long-distance jump attack occurs instead of the normal Great Hammer swinging attack.
  * The two-handed R1 attacks combo into the normal 2-handed R2 attack (Spin attack) on other Great Hammers (excluding Archdrake Mace).
  * The two-handed R2 attacks combo with an initial overhead attack, followed by a reverse overhead attack that hits behind the player.
  * Be aware that other players can begin a backstab while you're laying on the ground after using the special L2 attack, recommended to wear [Jester's Top](/Jester%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Jester%27s Set"), [Ironclad Armour](/Ironclad+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Armor") and/or [Gower's Ring of Protection](/Gower%27s+Ring+of+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Gower%27s Ring of Protection") to negate backstab critical damage.
  * Can be disguised as offhand Fist Weapon if one has [Illusory](/Illusory+Ring+of+a+Conqueror "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of a Conqueror") [Rings](/Illusory+Ring+of+the+Exalted "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of the Exalted") or [Hidden Weapon](/Hidden+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Hidden Weapon") spell while carrying [Caestus](/Caestus "Dark Souls 2 Caestus") as main weapon.
  * Rolling attack strikes both in front of you and behind you (more to the side that it's being held on) which is extremely useful to bait players coming out of a roll attempting to backstab.
  * move-set is fairly unknown in the online community and most people I have seen who use it don't use it to its full potential making it a wonderful surprise weapon to players in pvp When used properly. (Quite a hindrance to players who are not skilled with slower weapons as its difficult to utilize)
  * Great weapon in narrow spaces as durability is very high (so hitting walls is something you shouldn't care about) and difficult to avoid unless the enemy is good at dodging.
  * The immense power of this weapon could easily 1-2 shot any opponent in pvp especially with a backstab. (Backstab animation is seemingly slower than most great hammers)
  * 2 handed overhead attack will pancake nearly every enemy in game.
  * 2 handed move set is much faster than single handed.
  * The weapon is extremely large, and can take up good amount of screenspace making it hard to see.  
  

**DS2 Smelter Hammer Trivia  
**

  * The Smelter Hammer is often called the "Chicken Drumstick" or "Chicken Wing" by its fans because of its similar appearance.
