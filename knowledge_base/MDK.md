¹ _resulting in 68,8% equip load and 252 casting speed as well as 110 agility_   
  

###  **Spells** :

  * 2x [WotG](/Wrath+of+the+Gods)
  * 1x [Sunlight Spear](/Sunlight+Spear)
  * 4x [Great Lightning Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear)
  * 1x [Great Heal](/Great+Heal)
  * 1x [Great Magic Barrier](/Great+Magic+Barrier) (arguable, most likely PvP)

  

###  **Weapons** :
    
    
    | Left Hand | Right Hand |
    | --- | --- |
    | Havel's Great Shield +5 / | Defender Greatsword +5 (Lightning) / |
    | / | Dragon Chime +5 (Lightning, left or right hand, whichever you prefer) / |
    | Old Knight's Shield ² +10 (for PvP against other melee-ish fighter) / | Drakekeepers Sword ² +10 (Lightning, for PvP) / |
    

² _of course not both at the same time, would be way to heavy.. without[Old Knight's Shield](/Old+Knight%27s+Shield) and [Drakekeepers Sword](/Drakekeepers+Sword) we are at 68,8% equip load._   
  

###  **Armor** :

  * [Black Hood](/Black+Set) +5 (hence the required INT isn't provided, the defense is broken.. but we still get the +30 points in cast speed and +2 INT / FTH ^^)
  * [Alonne Captain Armor](/Alonne+Captain+Set) +10
  * [Engraved Gauntlets](/Engraved+Gauntlets) +5 (chance is small, but in case the effect applies, the extra damage is awesome)
  * [Lion Mage Skirt](/Lion+Mage+Set) +10

  

###  **Rings** :

  * [Third Dragon Ring](/Third+Dragon+Ring)
  * [Chloranthy Ring](/Chloranthy+Ring) +2 (... or [Royal Soldier's Ring](/Royal+Soldier%27s+Ring) +2, if you want to wear more than one sword / shield at the same time)
  * [Clear Bluestone Ring](/Clear+Bluestone+Ring) +2
  * [Southern Ritual Band](/Southern+Ritual+Band) +2

  

###  **Approach** :

Get to the Sunlight Altar in Harvest Valley as soon as possible (free Licia of Lindelt and open the path to Huntsman's Copse which eventually leads to Harvest Valley) and join the Heirs of the Sun. After that, choose your preferred boss and take him down 30 times by helping other players (leave your sign on the ground and let them call you into their world). Offer all medals to the Sunlight Altar, which you received for helping other players killing bosses, to increase your covenant rank to 3. You will receive the Sun Sword and Sunlight Spear for that. Now it's time to get your Faith to 55 and beat the game. Farm Giant Lord (using Bonfire Ascetic) for souls until your reach your desired soul level (and don't forget to pick up the Twinkling Titanite along with Bonfire Ascetic). Took me about an hour to get the rhythm of this little area / boss movements for fast farming and another 2-3ish hours to reach level 187.   
_In this video you can see how to fight the Giant Lord ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uibxrP_Y7o&feature=youtu.be&t=1h44m45s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uibxrP_Y7o&feature=youtu.be&t=1h44m45s) ). If you're new to this fight then I would recommend not using the stairs but instead the whole platform. The boss only uses horizontal and vertical slashes which you can easy dogde by rolling (vertical slash) or moving some steps backwards (horizontal slash). Thanks a hell of a lot to Elajjaz ! Very much appreciate your efforts._   
  

###  **Hints (for starters):**

Great starting equipment, hence we're going STR as well:   

  * [Twin Dragon Greatshield](/Twin+Dragon+Greatshield) (2000 souls in Majula)
  * [Cleric's Sacred Chime](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Cleric%27s+Sacred+Chime) (found in Majula, enables you to shoot regular [Lightning Spears ](/Lightning+Spear)early in the game)
  * [Mace](/Mace) (1200 souls in Majula, you can also buy a second one and use power stance, bosses like [Ruin Sentinels ](/Ruin+Sentinel)and [Mytha](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Mytha%2C+the+Baneful+Queen), can easily be beaten that way)

Upgrade this equipment at least to +6 (which certainly is not expensive) to boost your stats. Upgrade the Mace(s) to +10 to get A-scaling in STR.
