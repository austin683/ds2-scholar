**Pate's Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Although it appears to be common helmet/armor/gloves/trousers, it has in fact been meticulously customized.  
>   
> Belonged to mild-mannered Pate.  
>    
>  This has been considerably altered. Perhaps it was pillaged.

  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") (16,9k) if Pate is killed at any point of the game, including their fight with [Creighton](/Creighton+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Creighton of Mirrah").
