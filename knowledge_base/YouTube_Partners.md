##  YouTube Partners

The following is a list of YouTube channels from the Wiki community. These channels belong to community members which have made an effort to support the wikis growth and were kind enough to share their knowledge and efforts with us in a fashion that encourages the increase of information. **The channels listed here have exclusive permission to place their videos on the wiki, all other videos may be removed**. We do this to ensure that the wiki's pages are not cluttered with videos of varying usefulness and quality. To improve the functionality of the wiki for all users, we ask that video content is presented in links. To coordinate links in a fair and organized fashion we will use the forum thread [here](https://fextralife.com/forums/t29816/the-wikis-offically-acknowledged-youtube-channels/)
