**Blossom Kite Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing. 

     _"A rare shield depicting a blossoming flower, that soothes the weary heart of its bearer._

     _What makes flowers beautiful, and why are we comforted when we gaze upon them?  
Sadly the flower depicted on this shield went extinct long ago._

     _Effect: stamina recovery"_

### Acquired From

  * Metal chest in [Memory Of Vammar](/Memory+of+Vammar "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Vammar"), just before the Giant Soul.

### Scholar of the First Sin

  * Now located in [Sinners' Rise](/Sinners'+Rise "Dark Souls 2 Sinners' Rise"). After taking the lift to the lower level it will be on the left hand side when you enter the water, the [Undead Aberration](/Undead+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Undead Aberration") has been replaced with the [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry") in NG. (Actually the Flexile Sentry is there without NG+)

### Blossom Kite Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Infusing with Poison Stone gains 100% poison resistance (projectile and weapons only), compare to [Poison Moon Butterfly Shield](/Moon+Butterfly+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Moon Butterfly Shield"), this one has better defense, yet difficult to inflict poison with its bashing.
  * Stamina Regeneration is roughly equal to 5%
  * Stamina Regeneration Stacks with both [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom") and [Chloranthy Ring](/Chloranthy+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Chloranthy Ring") variants.
  * Stacks with other Stamina Regeneration Shields.
  * Stamina regeneration gained by using the shield does not offset the stamina regeneration loss of having the shield equipped. 
    * Tested with 60.2 Max Equip load and 42 equip weight (69.77%). 35.51 regen with the Shield equipped, 36.19 without the shield equipped. 
      * Note that it scales with max equip load and equipped weight, meaning that if you had 99 vitality and very light things you would see a benefit to stamina regenerating.
  * This shield was chosen to be in the game as one of the winners of the Shield Design Contest held by Bandai Namco and FromSoftware.
