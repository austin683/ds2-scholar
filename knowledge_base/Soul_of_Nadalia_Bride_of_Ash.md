### Soul of Nadalia, Bride of Ash Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * The fragments will only combine to form the True soul of Nadalia if they are all outside your item box while in Brume Tower. If you keep some fragments in the item box, then, after collecting all 12, you move them from your item box to your main inventory while outside of Brume Tower, the 12 fragments won't combine. You won't see the message appear and neither Straid nor Ornifex will offer the unique trade items. They'll combine after returning to Brume Tower (not sure if being in Brume Tower specifically is required or if all areas of The Old Iron King DLC have this effect).
