**Acquired From**   
  
[Dyna and Tillo](/Dyna+and+Tillo)'s crow nest by giving them a Petrified Something (Common), Smooth & Silky Stone (Rare) or Small Smooth & Silky Stone (Very Rare).  
  
**Hints and Tips:**   
Two-Handed Strong Attack's boost:

  * Seems to do a 25% damage boost. (tested with the Trident)
  * Seems to do a 5% damage boost to lightning miracles. (tested with Great Lightning Spear and Sunlight Spear)
  * Does affect Sorceries and Hexes.
  * Affects all nearby allies.
  * Uses 10 durability.
  * The boost lasts about 15 seconds.
  * Shows up as a faint orange sparkle/glow on affected players.
  * Only triggers near the end of the dance.
  * You can cancel the dance in the early frames with a roll, but no boost will occur even though you lose durability.

  
One-Handed Strong Attack:

  * The tip of the trident spins while hitting an opponent, hitting them three times. (effectively hitting them for three times the damage)
  * Works well with poison and bleed, especially if paired with [Sanctum Soldier Gauntlets](/Sanctum+Soldier+Gauntlets) \+ [Crest of the Rat](/Crest+of+the+Rat) or [Shadow Gauntlets](/Shadow+Set) \+ [Crest of Blood](/Crest+of+Blood) depending on the auxiliary infusion you picked.
  * Be warned that this attack is quite susceptible to being parried, and can potentially be parried and hit the opponent once or twice at the same time. (I once killed a player and got parried by him in the same single attack. He fell over dead as I sat motionless on the ground)
  * Has remarkably good directional control and can be used to hit opponents who roll to your side.

  
Rolling Attacks:

  * Both the one-handed and two-handed rolling attacks will also cause the head to spin and hit the target three times.
  * The one-handed rolling attack deals less damage and costs less stamina (minus the roll cost) than the one-handed R2.
  * Think of the one-handed rolling attack as the lighter longer-ranged version of the one-handed R2.
  * Works well with poison and bleed.

  
PvP

  * The two-handed buff **will affect friendly mobs** in the Grave of Saints and in the Door of Pharos if you are in the Rat King Covenant.
  * Infusing this weapon with poison and using the one-handed R2 stacks poison extremely effectively- especially so when combined with the Rat Covenant Ring.
  * Pairing this weapon with the Stone Ring is highly recommended, as it will eat through an opponent's stamina very quickly if they are blocking with a shield.
  * Pairing this weapon with the Bracing Knuckle Ring is recommended because it has very low durability, and using the one-handed R2 attack will deplete durability quickly.
  * Using the buff dance is very risky and only gives a small, temporary damage increase while decreasing the weapon's durability. Only use the dance if you are in a place where it will not get interrupted, and in a place where allies will receive benefit.
  * This weapon might be more effective if used as a poker in the left hand; using the one-handed R2 with its long range has little risk of counter-attack- give it a try! _(Thanks for the tip. This strategy worked well to help me get Bleed build-up on opponents, especially when the weapon in my right hand also caused bleeding.)_
  * While not technically beneficial, the two-handed R2 makes for a very satisfying goofy victory taunt, especially when combined with silly armour.
