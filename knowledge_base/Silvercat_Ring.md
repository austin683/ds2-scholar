### DS2 Silvercat Ring Tips and Notes

  * You can use this ring to reach some treasures early, such as the ones in the hole in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), the one that leads to [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter").
  * The ring allows you to safely fall into the salamander pit in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). Scattered around the pit are various pieces of wood and other refuse you can land on. The safest drop is in the top right corner after crossing the bridge below the Cardinal Tower bonfire. Be sure you have enough HP to survive the fall. If successful, loot the corpse and chest.
  * The effects of this ring stacks with other items that give reduced falling damage such as the [Flying Feline Boots](/Flying+Feline+Boots "Dark Souls 2 Flying Feline Boots") and the [Lion Warrior Cuffs](/Lion+Warrior+Cuffs "Dark Souls 2 Lion Warrior Cuffs").
