### DS2 King Ultra Greatsword Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with Petrified Dragon Bone to +5.
  * Produces a beam of light around the blade when two-handing.
  * This weapon is deceptively powerful when used in close range fighting where both the blade and the autobuff hit the target. The damage as stated is not definitive because the synergy between auto buff and blade hits are powerful beyond what AR would suggest.
  * While two-handing: ten durability (five with the [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring") +2) is consumed per swing on top of any additional durability loss from striking various things.
  * Recommended to wear Bracing Knuckle Ring +2 and carry a duplicate at secondary slot in case of durability issue.
  * The two-handed moveset range is extended although the extended range only deals the damage from the auto-buff, thus the damage is greatly reduced.
  * Once fully upgraded at normal path, it'll effectively stunlock foes with its two handed light attack.
  * Best left normal for damage or infused with bleed to put the outrageously long range as advantage.
  * It uses the same moveset as the [Zweihander](/Zweihander "Dark Souls 2 Zweihander"), except the one handed rolling attack, that does a left to right horizontal sweep.
