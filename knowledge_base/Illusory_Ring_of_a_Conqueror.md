**Illusory Ring of a Conqueror** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). The **Illusory Ring of a Conqueror** , crafted from a subtly misshaped blue stone, has the unique ability to render specific equipment invisible. It serves as a poignant reminder not to underestimate adversaries, for those who seemingly approach unarmed may conceal formidable weapons behind their backs. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

### Illusory Ring of a Conqueror Locations in Dark Souls 2

  * Clear game without dying. This includes dying while wearing [Rings of Life Protection](/Ring+of+Life+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Life Protection"), or while a phantom in another player's world.
  * After clearing the game without dying, you should obtain the ring after the credits.
  * **DO NOT SKIP THE CREDITS.** Many players have cleared the game with the requirements but have not obtained the rings. It is not yet confirmed, but it seems likely that skipping the credits may actually stop you from getting the rings. **To be safe, watch the whole credits after finishing the game**.
  * It is possible to back up your save every once in a while and reload it should you die if you just want the ring and don't care for the challenge.

### DS2 Illusory Ring of a Conqueror Tips and Notes

  * A good strategy to achieve this is to complete it in a NG+ or higher world where your gear is already endgame, preventing death from early bosses that may prove challenging with early game weapons and providing high amounts of Estus and healing items from the previous play through.

Don't forget you can sell a bunch of stones and arrows and stuff to [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan") to reach high enough Soul Memory in the next [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Obviously you need Denial, but that usually won't save you if you're fighting a fire enemy or if you're caught in a grab attack or combo.

Using NPC summons is a MUST, so don't skip talking to Benhart, Vengarl, Agdayne or Lucatiel when you pass their areas.

In the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"), don't stick around long enough to get ganked by Leydia Pyromancers and Hollows and Skeletons, just run past them, don't forget the ladder that leads to the Leydia Witch so you don't have to get caught in the tombstones. Bait the Imperious Knights and counterattacking them patiently and carefully. Make sure to kill the Wall Ghosts right away. When you get into the large room with the tombstones and low ceiling, look around for the wide hallway and exit the room right away, then pull the lever to extend the bridge and go rest at the nearby bonfire.

Make sure to summon Agdayne to help you kill the Dragonrider guarding Velstadt's fog door. I would go back and rest at the bonfire after that, then go again, since the Dragonrider doesn't respawn. There will also be 2 Syan Knights and some Leydia Pyromancers behind you once you reach the Syan Knights, so be careful.

Don't forget to use Guidance before the fight, and to restock its uses. Be wary of Velstadt's reach. Don't be greedy.  
If Velstadt kills Agdayne before Velstadt's down to less than a quarter health, I would warp back to the bonfire assuming you're far enough away to do so safely (try putting some distance between you and him just before he finishes off Agdayne so you have enough time to use the Feather/Homeward Bone/Homeward (don't waste a slot on Homeward).

Use the zipline above the bonfire in Dragon's Aerie to skip most of Dragon's Aerie and go straight to the Dragon Shrine. Use poison arrows to soften up the Drakekeepers and the Ogres in Aldia's Keep. Honestly, anything you can kill with arrows, kill it with arrows, even if it's monotonous. I got grabbed by an Ogre in Aldia's Keep and it ruined my second attempt.
