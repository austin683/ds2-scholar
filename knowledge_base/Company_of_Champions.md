The **Company of Champions** in **Dark Souls 2** is one of two covenants that are available as soon as you get to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). Being a member of this covenant substantially increases the game's difficulty level by making every enemy deal 50% more damage and decreasing the player damage by 20%. In addition, being in this covenant also disables cooperative play, removing the player's ability to summon anybody, including NPCs. Other players are still able to invade your world.   

**Covenant leader:** Victor's Stone   
**Where to join:** [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula")

## How to join Company of Champions

In [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), take the path along the coast to the right of the doorway leading to [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame") to find the Victor's Stone monument. Pray to it and you will be asked to join the Company of Champions covenant.   
  
Upon joining the covenant, players will also be given the [Champion's Tablet](/Champion%27s+Tablet "Dark Souls 2 Champion%27s Tablet"). This item can be used to display a leaderboard showing the names of the players who have offered the most [Awestones](/Awestone "Dark Souls 2 Awestone") to the Victor's Stone.   
While this covenant is strongly focused around PvE, it can be PvP focused as well, because defeating red phantom invaders in your world will drop [Awestones](/Awestone "Dark Souls 2 Awestone"), which you will need to acquire higher ranks.   
**WARNING** : While you're in this covenant you cannot be summoned or summon other players, not even NPCs like Lucatiel etc... so their symbols will not appear. It should be mentioned, however, that you CAN summon red signs still, allowing for some amount of co-op if you have the item [Seed of a Tree of Giants](/Seed+of+a+Tree+of+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Seed of a Tree of Giants") activated. Leaving the covenant restores the world back to the way it was, including being able to summon NPCs.

### Rank

  
Covenant rank is increased by offering [Awestones](/awestone "Dark Souls 2 awestone") to the Victor's Stone in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). These stones are obtained by defeating invading red phantoms, both players and NPCs, and they are occasionally dropped by enemies as well. Note that it is **NOT** necessary to defeat player invaders to obtain the required amount of Awestones to reach rank 3 in this covenant. This can easily be done without PvP and without going to [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus") (Check out the [Awestone](/Awestone "Dark Souls 2 Awestone") page for information on how to farm them.)   
If you focus on defeating invaders as a way of obtaining Awestones, and don't mind getting interrupted, you can use a [Token of Spite](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite") and/or wear the [Delicate String](/Delicate+String "Dark Souls 2 Delicate String") ring to increase your chances of being invaded.   
  
**Known Awestone-dropping enemies:**

  * [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") (Forest of the Fallen Giants)

  * Enhanced Undead ([Sinner's Rise](/Sinner%27s+Rise "Dark Souls 2 Sinner%27s Rise"))
  * [Mutant Dogs](/Swollen+Mongrel "Dark Souls 2 Swollen Mongrel") ([The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"))

  * [Llewellyn Stone Soldiers](/Stone+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Stone Knight") ([King's Passage](/King%27s+Passage "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Passage")) (be aware of that cutting their head while they're not moving seems to prevent them from dropping anything)

### Notes, Hints and Tips

  * Also known as "Hunters" or "Lures" by the online community, as they lure red phantoms to their world for quick Awestones.
  * [Bell Keeper](/Bell+Keeper "Dark Souls 2 Bell Keeper") invaders (Grey phantoms) do not drop Awestones.
  * Red phantoms summoned by using their Red Soapstone sign do not drop Awestones.
  * Obtain Awestones by killing the red invader [Bowman Guthry](/Bowman+Guthry "Dark Souls 2 Bowman Guthry") (appears on NG+) in Doors of Pharros at the first bonfire.
  * [Rhoy the Explorer](/Rhoy+the+Explorer "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy the Explorer"), in the Grave of Saints with Bonfire Intensity 2 or more, will also invade 12 total times (infinite times when you join this covenant). Farm him by going down and up the ladder outside of the second bonfire (his lack of reach can be advantageous) NOTE: Actually you burn the Ascetic by the FIRST bonfire, then teleport to the second bonfire and drop down the ladder & climb up to get Rhoy
  * Releasing [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan") will grant more opportunities to farm Awestones.
  * Joining this covenant will give all non-special enemies unlimited spawns for the duration you're in the covenant (special enemies such as the Aldia Warlock in Shrine of Amana or the necromancers in Huntsman's Copse will not respawn). Once you leave, all enemies will return to the spawning condition they had before you joined.
  * The enemies at Doors of Pharros have a chance of dropping awestone when you join the covenant.
  * If playing offline (this works online too of course!), and you don't want to use the Rhoy farming method, the invisible Roaming Souls in the Shaded Woods are the next best option as an awestone source.   
  
Starting at the Shaded Ruins bonfire, you can kill either 4 or 6 of them (dependent on the route you use) in about 4 minutes each run. Additionally, and unlike their buddies in the woods themselves, these ones are lazy, and as such are all sitting down. This means you are _guaranteed_ to get at least one or two attacks on them before they can react at all. If you have the [Jester's Robes](/Jester's+Robes "Dark Souls 2 Jester's Robes"), put them on to prevent any danger from their infamous backstab attack. Also, see the [Item Discovery](/Item+Discovery "Dark Souls 2 Item Discovery") page for ways to increase the drop chances (also, these guys don't drop anything but awestones, so their loot table is very favorable compared to other options.)  
  

    1. The first one is right in front of the bonfire, on the left hand side of the hallway. 
       * The strategy for every one of these guys is to use a weapon that's not too big, not too small, allowing quick damage without the need to lock on. You want to get about 5 paces away from them, ensure your stamina is full, then rush and get those free hits in while they are still standing up. Once they stand, don't stop swinging if possible, as you can easily stunlock them to death. They're only really dangerous if you let them get anywhere _near_ your back. When in melee range, they are coded to fish for backstabs. If you aren't confident in your weapon or method, just return to the bonfire and keep killing this first guy until you have it worked out, and use that same method on every other one we run into. (For me, the most effective method is to blend them to death with a 2 handed R2 into R1 combo with [Santier's Spear](/Santier's+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Santier's Spear"), though any [twinblade](/Twinblades "Dark Souls 2 Twinblades") is a good option!)  
  

    2. Make a right out of the door, hugging the ruin wall on your right (don't go in the door, we'll do that later) until you come to a little area that juts out, blocking your path. There's one just behind this wall, but there are also 2 curse pots. We want to take care of the pots first. Go around the wall, and immediately roll into the corner, breaking the pots. Because of the roll, we won't get our usual ambush on this Roaming Soul, as he'll be standing up now, but you can still stun lock him to death easily.  

       * The [curse pots](/Curse+Jar "Dark Souls 2 Curse Jar") only pose a threat the very first time you do the run through - as long as you don't  _leave_ the area, resting on the bonfire  _will not respawn them!_ This makes every run after the first even simpler!  
  

    3. From this point, turn your back to the wall, and note the raised ground/hill in front of you with a tree on its left edge and a small, low wall running the length. There is one Roaming Soul (Knife) with his back to that wall, and another one (Crossbow) past him with his back to the cliff, facing the tree. If you approach/attack one of these guys, the other will react, so you can decide to skip this step if you're underleveled or don't think you can take one out quick enough. I highly recommend taking out the one with his back to the wall first, as the crossbow variant is much easier to take out and is less likely to backstab you to death.
    4. If you took those two out, look back towards the area where you rolled into the curse pots. You'll see a doorway on the right of the ruins. Approach it by going back down the hill the same way you came, but don't go inside yet. (If you chose to skip that last part, simply go back around the wall where you rolled into the curse pots, and stop at the doorway on your left.) Once in the doorway, you'll probably realize your quickly getting cursed by the pot right in front of you, but you should _also_ see the small gap separating you from an area with a chest and another Roaming Soul with his back to the wall on the right side of the chest. You can choose to take the pot out with an [iron arrow](/Iron+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Iron Arrow") or a [Dark Orb](/Dark+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Dark Orb"), but you should just do what I do: **get a running start and jump the small gap** , but _let your stamina recover after_. (He won't get up until you are close to him, so this is safe.) Once you've caught your breath, take him out for Chinese food.
    5. Hop over the wall where the last Roaming Soul was sitting (this works first try most times, but if a "baby jump" comes out, it won't) or, just drop down the little gap you hopped before, heading out the same door we did after we killed the first one. Now, make a left, but get awayand walk evenly between the ruins on your left and the building on your right. Getting too close to either one will cause pots to curse you, and you could break them, but that takes too long. Once you are perpendicular with the end of the building on the right, look behind it to see the final Roaming Soul with his back to a tree, near the rear wall. (He's the most camouflaged out of all these guys, and aggroes a little earlier than the others too) This one can be dangerous to get if you don't have a high enough curse resistance, as ambushing him where he sits will quickly build the curse from pots inside that building. You can hit him once, then retreat to the open area, but he does have a Crossbow, and I find it better to just kill him quick like all the others and run away from the building.
    6. That's it! Return to the bonfire and do it again! You can alter the route as you see fit, but I've included all the Roaming Soul enemies in the area except the one in the basement of that last building, who is not worth the trouble at all as he can't be ambushed without a guaranteed curse. 
       * I created a video here of the route if you like!
