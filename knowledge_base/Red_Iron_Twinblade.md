Attack Type: Slash/Thrust

Enchantable: Yes

Special: No

*When infused: 238 physical dmg/238 elemental dmg and B scaling with chosen element. Str scaling changes to B. 

**Red Iron Twinblade** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2.**

  
  
_"A twinblade with heavy blades on each end. More suited to smashing foes than slashing them. Requires a great deal of muscle to wield artfully._   
_The twinblade closely imitates the design of a foreign-made weapon that has the blades affixed to both ends of its hilt."_

###  **Acquired From**

  * [Shrine Of Amana](/Shrine+Of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine Of Amana")
    * Between the third Bonfire: [Rhoy's Resting Place](/Rhoy's+Resting+Place "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy's Resting Place"), and the Fog Gate leading to the [Demon of Song](/Demon+of+Song "Dark Souls 2 Demon of Song") boss fight. Can be found on a corpse beneath a low-hanging branch, in the centre of the island where several [Amana Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") are gathered. 

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * The scaling has been increased from "always C" into "B to A" and the base attack rating has been **significantly** buffed from 180 to 340 with Regulation 1.08.
  * Deals higher Poise damage than the other twinblades, and is also extremely durable.
  * This twinblade has a different moveset than others in its class. Specifically, the two handed light attack moveset is different than most (rather than doing a 3-hit combo, it does one large swipe), and in general it's harder to land all of its multiple hits with (this is from anecdotal experience). On the plus side its one handed strong attack is a thrust with decent range followed by a swipe to side the weapon is equipped on. Although slightly slower and heavier than normal twinblades, the poise damage can cover up for the weakness on speed.
  * Recommended to wear [Stone Ring](/Stone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Stone Ring") to increase Poise damage to max potential.
