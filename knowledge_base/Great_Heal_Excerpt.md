**Great Heal Excerpt** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle.

> "A highly advanced miracle.  
> An excerpt from the Great Heal tome.  
> Greatly restores HP.  
> Its effect is the same as Great Heal,  
> but has limited uses.  
>   
> The erudite Great Heal tome requires  
> extensive training to properly interpret,  
> making it accessible to only a select few."

### Acquired From

  * Purchase from Licia of Lindeldt for 4500 souls.

### Notes

  * Has the smallest AoE out of any basic healing miracle and it does not heal allies, the healing amount is identical to [Great Heal](/Great+Heal).
  * Not very useful in Co-Operative play since it only has 1 use, 2 if using the Saint's Hood or having high attunement.  
However, it is extremely useful in PvP due to its slightly faster casting speed than [Great Heal](/Great+Heal), the difference of 1 second can be the matter of life and death.
  * Among all healing miracles, this is the only one which you can actually walk while casting the spell, you can also hold charging while walking around.
