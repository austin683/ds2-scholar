# **_Sir Tiedemann_**

* * *

_“Finely skilled swordsman. Fights gracefully with strong weapons in both hands.”  
_  
This is a minimalistic, challenge-oriented PvE build made to showcase the game’s [power stance](/power+stance "Dark Souls 2 power stance") mechanic- a stand-out feature of _Dark Souls II_. The page includes **three** main **RH1/ LH1** sets that help give the build some small degree of rounding. These variations in equipment will be a _vital boon_ when you find yourself stuck in an area (or if your moves are getting _stale_!). As a welcome bonus, most of the needed equipment is available early in the game’s progression.

It is important to note that this build is as much stylistic as it is refined. Sitting slightly uncomfortably at [SL135](https://fextralife.com/calculator/dks2builds.html?lsevNn2sc.FCY6qFe2R.BNAaFvV0m.MwVAPO4z.OMbb2eqAV.A.DVWXuh "SL135"), the build is made to never give you more than you need, nor more than you deserve. A fine balance has been struck between necessary strength and audacious disadvantage in the pursuit of becoming a true [champion](/Company+of+Champions "Dark Souls 2 Company of Champions")! All stat investments have been chosen with specific breakpoints in mind, and all of the variations in equipment fit neatly in the carry weight allotted.

The page is written with the presumption that **power stancing** is _always enabled_.

> ‘Sir Tiedemann’ is a rough idea I had years ago for a red-headed man who was both a confident duelist and a renowned swordsman. In my initial blurry imagining of a confident man, only a few details were clear. He bore no shield and his frame was slight, but his masterful swordplay spoke for itself. Perhaps most importantly, he was an undeniably charming, rosy-faced man with a dazzling moustache and a flare for the fanciful.”

## **STATS & OVERVIEW**

  
**Lv: 135**  
Class: [Swordsman](/Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Swordsman")  
Gift: Healing Wares

Below is a rendition of what the peak damage potential of this build _could_ look like. **Blue Flame** allows both weapons to be enchanted simultaneously- and with a well-executed combo this setup is able to _decimate_ most normal enemies in the game.

Of course, **Flame Weapon** is not without its faults- the build can be operated much more sustainably by focusing on just _Magic Weapon_. Even so, this build _does_ make some small concessions favouring _flare_ over heightened potential.

A rendition of the build in peak form. **RH1** & **RH2** **** are swapped the most frequently. **LH1** is most always occupied by **Blue Flame** , which supersedes the **Shortsword**. **RH1** is typically reserved for the bow or crossbow- just as **LH3** is typically reserved for a catalyst. 

> Among the living, he was famous for never allowing so much as a slightest nick of tarnish to mark his armor. He seemed to bear his swords and armor in higher esteem than any of the graces ever bestowed to him by Kings or Lords. Some years later, plagued by the despondency of undeath, Tiedemann has had to abandon this legacy. He has found himself hardened through struggle. For the first time, he has learned to test his mettle by trading blows- and in doing so, forgotten his vanity.”

    | HEIDE KNIGHT SWORD | SCIMITAR | BLACKSMITH’S HAMMER |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | This is the first power stance as it requires the lowest investment.  Easily the most balanced moveset with regard to managing crowds. | Though a starting weapon,  it requires 22 DEX before it can be power stanced .  This weapon excels in controlling single engagements and drawn out DPS pressure. | Requires 22 STR to be power stanced .  It can be tricky to use,  but arguably the most rewarding in terms of raw damage. |

### **THREE PRACTICAL SPELLS**
    
    
    | Magic Weapon | Flash Sweat | Repair |

    | 50+ magic damage -  easily maintainable and highly visually appealing.  A trademark spell. | Sits in the back pocket until needed. 300 fire resist .  That’s a lot.  The most powerful spell in all of Dark Souls . | Utilitarian comfort for the Scimitar .  Later becomes an essential option for use in long-lasting boss fights . |

###    
**PROGRESSION**

### **GETTING STARTED**

The starting class being [Swordsman](/Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Swordsman"), simple milestones can be set to can follow. The Swordsman starts with a **Scimitar +1** and **Shortsword +1** already at hand. 

  1. Firstly, kill the ogre in **Things Betwixt** _before_ greeting the witches. Equip the **Stone Ring**.
  2. At the _Cardinal Tower_ , a checklist of items are to be collected.  

     1. Collect the **Small Leather Shield** from the room above the bonfire.
     2. Buy a **Pharros Lockstone** and a small handful of _firebombs_ from Melentia.
     3. Blow up the breakable wall shortcut and proceed to the right-hand room with the ballistae. In the basement behind a _Pharros_ illusory wall, collect the **Chloranthy Ring**.
     4. Before leaving, buy the **Travelling Merchant Hat** (_Silver Serpent Ring_ optional) from Melentia. Be sure to exhaust her dialogue to _trigger her move_.
  3. Move on to _Heide’s Tower of Flame_. Using the aforementioned items, farm the **Heide Knight Sword** there.
  4. Return to Majula. Use the souls farmed to level **STR** to **16** , enabling **power stance**.
  5. Before departing, increase **INT** to **8** (only **1** level) to enable Carhillion’s merchant services. Any remaining souls can be used freely to level up or stock up on items.
  6. Work through _Heide’s Tower_ and into _No Man’s Wharf_. Carhillion is waiting at the end- he sells both **Magic Weapon** and a starter catalyst. **ATN** **10** is needed before any **spells** can be cast.
  7. Blacksmith Lenigrast will gift the Blacksmith’s Hammer once **8k+** souls have been spent on  _reinforcement_. He can alternately be killed for it.

### 

  1. Collect the rest of the gear- most notably the Witchtree Branch and the Sea Bow. Complete the **base build**. 
     1. Both _flames_
     2. _Second Dragon Ring_ is given by Tark after defeating the Scorpioness.
  2. Upgrade order should start with one of the **3** **main weapons**. The second **_titanite slab_** should go to **Blue Flame** (or _Shortsword_). 
  3. Following _titanite slabs_ should go to **armor** , then any _extra weapons_.
  4. The Third Dragon Ring is held in the Dragon Shrine.
  5. The Chloranthy Ring +2 can be earned by using a bonfire aescetic to kill the Chariot boss again.
  6. Covetous Gold Serpent Ring
  7. The **Ring of Blades +2**

    
    
    | Shortsword | Blue Flame |
    | --- | --- |
    | “Ol’ reliable” / This weapon deserves more credit than it gets.  It plays a key role in the early progression of this build until it’s made obsolete by the Blue Flame .  Unfortunately, Blue Flame supersedes it in almost every way-  including a longer reach.  The LT thrust attack is the only useful trait it holds over its replacement. | Being both a catalyst and an improvement upon the Shortsword ,  it takes over as the permanent left hand immediately upon obtaining it.  This weapon also makes possible a signature technique- dual enchanted swords .  To achieve this,  equip a second catalyst (or flame) in an alternate slot on the opposite hand. |

SKILLS, TECHNIQUES & STREAMLINING

“When you **drain your stamina** completely you get hit with a **movement penalty**. All attacks, rolls, raising your shield, and using items are delayed. And of course **stamina regenerates slower** … You will be hit with this penalty until about two seconds AFTER your stamina completely regenerates.” -_infamousralphst, GameFAQs_

**  
COMBO ATTACKING**  
  
As a general rule, your combo attacks should begin as:

**RB ⇒ LB ⇒ RB ⇒ LB ⇒ x**

You may be thinking- ‘Why not more **LB** inputs as a power stancer?’. The simple answer is the relation between **weight** and **stamina consumption**. With some **RB** hits thrown in, you can chain more **total damage** (**+poise damage**) than if you spent it all pressing **LB**. For example:

**LB ⇒ LB ⇒ x**

BURNS ALL STAMINA- whereas…  
  
**RB ⇒ LB ⇒ RB ⇒ LB ⇒ LT**

BURNS ALL STAMINA with **2 extra attacks** thrown in.

A critical trick of using your stamina bar is knowing what to do with the last bit **before the bar is exhausted**. Saving the last bit for an evasive roll or a heavy-hitting **LT** input are two tricks, and letting the bar **regenerate without exhausting** it is an exercise often crucial to your own survival.

**EQUIPMENT**

### **RINGS**
    
    
    | Slot 1 | STONE RING | Slot 2 | Chloranthy Ring +2 |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    |  | This ring is the cornerstone of the build.  While playing as a Swordsman,  you need to be confident in the impact of your swings.  The cumulative poise damage will stagger most humanoids-  affording you the relative safety to execute your combos in single engagements.  The importance of this ring (as pertaining to this build) in general play cannot be overstated . Conversely,  when soloing bosses this ring becomes a major flop . Bracing Knuckle Ring +2 becomes increasingly indispensable as the NG cycles wear on (unless you prefer Repair Powder ). Life Ring +2 and Dispelling Ring +1 are two other strong contenders.  Plainly put-  when boss-fighting,  this ring becomes an open slot . |  | Easy to understand.  Switch to Ring of Binding if you’re dying a lot.  Can be swapped for Flame Quartz Ring +2 when fighting Blue Smelter Demon. |
    | Slot 3 | Ring of Blades +2 | Slot 4 | THIRD DRAGON RING |
    |  | A staple.  Note that this ring is practically doubly effective as a dual wielder.  Likely the last ring to consider changing. |  | “ Too good to pass up ”.  While this ring mostly speaks for itself,  the benefits will be fully explored below for the sake of clarity.  It is recommended to keep a spare in your inventory as it is known to break easily . Firstly and most importantly,  the 12.5% bonus means enough added stamina for an LT finisher or an extra RB swing in your combos. Longer combos → more time swinging → more staggering your enemies.  Also-  to touch briefly on the 28 END -  at 28 ,  stamina upticks * by 1 .  With this in mind, it seems an apt place to stop levelling endurance .  Luckily,  it also seems to almost always afford you just enough stamina needed for either a retreat roll or an LT finisher . * increases by 2 ticks instead of 1 and only with the ring on A 12.5% VIT bonus also proves invaluable in keeping your equip load below 50% - a major asset in mobility. The 7.5% boost to your HP is nothing to sneeze at, either. * if you decide to run with the hammer ,  you will need to unequip the sea bow if you wish to stay below 50% equip load |

**  
HEIDE KNIGHT SWORD** [RH1]  
_“Not everyone seems to like this weapon. A truly divisive sword in the DS2 community. It really seems like you either love it or hate it.”_

This sword is a very effective **CC** and **positioning** tool. The **LB** swing is extremely proficient in **managing crowds** -**** being able to **swat multiple mobs** out of your way at once. **LB** is a reliable option to **knock enemies** off of platforms without so much forward motion as to risk**falling off** yourself. The **RB** attack also demonstrates **limited foward movement** while maintaining a **serviceable reach**.

A unique **RB** sweep has the benefit of being able to hit **enemies on the ground**. The **RB** lands consistently in **free-aim** when drifting **aim to the left** or keeping **enemies on the right**. Players who master the **RB** will (_hopefully_) concede **two things** : that this weapon is a **monster** in its **consistency** , and that it demonstrates a healthy aversion to **overextending** yourself.

Two more high-value moves that this weapon flaunts are its **RT** / **LT** attacks. **RT** can be used to execute on-the-spot **180º turns** for incredible **horizontal hit retention**. The **LT** ‘ _X-Slash’_ is a **gap-closer** that comes in handy when an enemy is just **out of range**. Executed properly, the move’s forward step will dip you **within range** and immediately **knock them** back.

Lastly, and not to be under-appreciated- its **light weight** and **high durability** mean you can swing this sword left and right with wild abandon…

**  
SCIMITAR** [RH1]

This is a very stylish weapon that offers **high pressure** potential. The scimitar excels at **sticking to its target** , and in many cases its moveset can even be used to dance in-and-out of range while **juggling** mobs.  _Juggling_ being the operative word here, it should be noted that while its **single-target pressure** is high, its performance versus groups can be found somewhat lacking. That being said, flailing your scimitar wildly into crowds (especially **LB**) can often stun and net you kills- but it will just as often get you killed.

The **RT** delivers a **point-blank** ‘gut punch’ that often **thwarts** incoming hits via a blow to enemy poise. The **LT** is a supremely sytlish ‘**execute** ’ attack that spans a wide horizontal berth. When both swords connect it is a very strong attack.

**  
BLACKSMITH’S HAMMER** [RH1/ LH1]

_“This was the 3rd weapon to be added to the arsenal. While I initially disliked the idea of Tiedemann wielding a hammer, its credibility as a weapon was not to be ignored. The hammer has the best poise damage of any of the single-handed size weapons (as far as I am aware).”_

This weapon really shines when used against enemies with a large frame and are therefore easier to consistently hit. This weapon is a knockback and hitstun machine. If you notice an enemy has high **poise** , use this weapon to **knock** whatever’s in front of you the **hell out of your way**. Note that this weapon will take you above **50% weight** capacity unless you unequip the **Sea Bow**.

Try asking yourself if you suspect your enemy might be vulnerable to **strike damage**. Are they sporting metal armor, or even hard, scaly skin? A quick study of enemy’s appearance but also their sound queues provides a valuable hint: if they **LOOK** or **SOUND** like they are made of either **METAL** or **STONE** \- try hitting them with a hammer!

To describe **LB** as point-blank is an understatement. The enemy basically needs to be rubbing up against your _left knee_ to be used safely. The **LB** could be called ‘impractical’ except when it immediately follows an **RB** input. **RB** followed by a fully-realized **LB** will achieve great **burst** damage. The **LT** can rarely hit up to four times (try on cornered targets or mobs too large to be moved). The **RT** provides a wonderful **hitstun** , and can be chained by itself.
    
    
    | pros | cons |
    | --- | --- |
    | ⇑⇑ high poise DMG | ⇓somewhat slow overall |
    | ⇑⇑ easy hitstun ( RT ) | ⇓vulnerable after swinging |
    | ⇑very quick LB when following RB | ⇓⇓awkward LB hitbox |
    | ⇑⇑very strong backstab |  |
    

♣This weapon hits noticeably harder than the two swords. Its biggest drawback is its LB is awfully close-ranged and it can be tricky to land.♣

_**SHORTSWORD**_ [LH1]

The Shortsword serves as the main left hand for simple reasons. It has good durability, serviceable damage and low stat requirements. In short- reliable.

_**HEIDE LANCE**_ [RH1]  
The inclusion of this weapon is somewhat of an afterthought and is thus dependant on the **Strength Ring** (replacing **Chloranthy**) if it is to be power stanced. The best time to bring it out is if you’re struggling with **highly aggressive** humanoids like the archdrake pilgrims or rampart soldiers who tend to penetrate your defensive bubble quickly. A few jabs from this weapon will bring them down with ease (also useful vs swollen mongrels). 

Pairs well with the Estoc.  
*if choosing not to power stance, consider swapping _stone ring_ for  _old leo ring_

_**(Dark) Pyromancy Flame**_ [RH2]  
Only for casting **Flash Sweat**. Either flame works the same.

_**SEA BOW**_ [RH3]  
This bow offers the **best range** of any regular bows in the game. Why bother with anything else? Mostly used for **picking and luring** enemies with rare instances of **sniping** them down. Also the preferred method for inflicting **poison**. Note that when using the _hammer_ , this weapon will likely need to be unequipped to keep below **50%** encumbrance.

_**Small Leather Shield**_ [LH2]  
**Parry** option for the lowest available weight. Highly situational. It’s also very useful to have a shield to use against ashen crawlers.

_**WITCHTREE BRANCH**_ [LH3]  
Last but far from least, this catalyst features the fastest **casting speed** and the lowest weight available. This and the low **INT** investment of **16** make it the only choice for this build. The default [Sorcerer’s Staff](/Sorcerer's+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sorcerer's Staff") is more than fine as a substitute- weighing **1** unit more and with less scaling power or speed.

_“Among the living, he was famous for never allowing so much as a slightest nick to tarnish his armor. He seemed to bear his swords and armor in higher esteem than any of the graces ever bestowed to him by Kings or Lords. Some years later, plagued by the despondency of undeath, Tiedemann has had to abandon this legacy. He has found himself hardened through struggle. For the first time, he has learned to test his mettle by trading blows- and in doing so, forgotten his vanity.”_

**CONSUMABLES**

One thing largely overlooked in **FROM SOFT** guides is item management.

Assuming that: **1.** there’s no imminent danger & **2\. VIG 35**(**1816 HP**)- lifegems can be put to efficient use in making Estus go farther. Below is a table that helps to paint a picture of how:
    
    
    | current HP | recommended heals | heals |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0-10% | Estus + Estus (+ Lifegem ) | 1600 HP (+ 500 HP) |
    | 11-25% | Old Radiant Lifegem + Lifegem | 1800 HP |
    | 26-40% | Radiant Lifegem + Lifegem | 1350 HP |
    | 41-50% | Radiant Lifegem (+ Lifegem) | 850 HP (+ 500 HP) |
    

Having a system helps prevent deaths caused by **item fumbling**. Assigning slots to _types_ of items really simplifies things. The following is an example- items are arranged in an order that allows for **fluid usage** & switching. More tips below:

this setup is made for bightstone cove
    
    
    | I (constant) | II (constant) | III | IV | V |

    |  |  | / | / | — |
    | VI | VII | VIII | IX | X |
    | / | — |  | — | — |
    

  * **slots 1-2 NEVER change**
  * **any projectile in slot 3 helps streamline gameplay**
  * **slots 4-5 are great for heals, Repair Powder**
  * **minimizing selected items is encouraged- you will surely fumble otherwise**
