#  Corrosive Ant Queen 

"A queen of the species of giant corrosive ants native to Jugo.   
Only one exsits in Drangleic; its presence in The Gutter seems   
to suggest that it began its life in the labratory of Lord Aldia's   
mansion and eventually outlived its usefullness"   
  
Despite its horrifying appearance and the nearby poison ticks, it is not hostile to the player and actually beneficial.   

  * The blue gas it produces heals poison, although causes durability wear.
  * Found in a cave in the [Gutter](/Gutter), guarded by hostile poison ticks.
