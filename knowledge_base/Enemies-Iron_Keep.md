## Iron Keep Enemies

  

  

###  [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight)

  

  

  

###  [Entity of Avarice](/Entity+of+Avarice) (Mimic)

  

A monster which looks like (mimics) a regular chest but will attack the player when opened or struck. The mimic will gobble up any player standing close to it, a move which deals high damage and can kill a player outright. 

  
_**One of two Iron Mimics in the game. (Needs confirmation)**_

  

  

###  [Alonne Knight Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain)

  

The Alonne Captains are similar to their subordinates, except they are clad in heavier armor and are physically larger. Using larger, lightning-enchanted Katanas (upon closer inspection the sword more resembles the Ivory King Ultra Greatsword) and the same greatbows as the Knights at their command, Alonne Captains are much more dangerous foes since they tend to go for quickdraw to strike within a split second, though they share the same vulnerabilities. Periodically, when a player gets inside a Captain's natural sword range, the Captain may use unarmed strikes to stun or disrupt the player.   
  
Some Alonne Captains do not carry greatbows (especially Red Phantom version seen at higher bonfire intensity), they'll actively pursue the player and utilize quickdraws, a minor trivia, their shoulder paldron loosely resemble Nineball from the original _Armored Core_ , the red unmaned AC in From Software's early title, this can be seen when Alonne Captains are coated with Red Phantom aura at higher bonfire intensity. 

  

  

###  [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier)

  

These are the first really "heavy hitters" you encounter. Knights sent from the Iron King's stronghold to reinforce Drangleic against the marauding giant horde, the Old Ironclads are weathered, weaker versions of their stronger cousins. They are nonetheless formidable, clad in heavy armor resembling a turtle's shell and which provides them with enormous defense. Difficult to stagger, these armored juggernauts carry massive footman's maces designed to smash defenders into paste. Though most of their attacks can be blocked, their swings do enormous stamina drain if defended against with anything less than a greatshield, so dodging them is recommended. They are the only source for the Old Ironclad set. Note that the Ironclads found in [Iron keep](/Iron+keep) are identical, but they have more health, and defense, and cause more damage than their weaker brethren. 

  

  

###  [The Pursuer](/Pursuer)

  

A giant, aggressive knight that relentlessly "pursues" the player. Heavily armored in black, it wields the [Pursuer's Ultra Greatsword](/Pursuer%27s+Ultra+Greatsword) with a corresponding "heavy hitter" moveset. He can move very quickly for such a large enemy, and can, in particular, close rapidly on the player from a distance. Can be encountered in multiple locations. After the main boss fight in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants), the secondary encounters are not explicit boss fights, and do not grant as many souls as the first encounter. In NG+, the Pursuer will appear more regularly. 

  
  
  
  

##  Enemy Invader

  
  

###  [Forlorn](/Forlorn)

  

_Born of Aldia's Obsession with the First Sin, the Forlorn lost both their corporeal form and a world to call their own. Now they drift into other worlds, ever in search of a home. But without self, one has neither beginning nor end, and so the Forlorn have only to wander._
