**Xanthous Waistcloth** is a **Legging** and a part of [Xanthous Set](/Xanthous+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Xanthous Waistcloth Description

_"This blindingly-bright yellow costume is said to have been worn by Xanthous King._  
  
_Perhaps the heinously towering head cloth crown served some purpose, or perhaps it was some strange display of power"_  
  
_Despite the costume's being in near tatters, its yellow hues are mysteriously unfaded."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Obtained after killing the [Darklurker](/Darklurker) boss in the third [Dark Chasm](/Dark+Chasm+of+Old) for the "[Pilgrims of Dark](/Pilgrims+of+Dark)" covenant.

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite)
  * Although a minor change, the head piece is considerably smaller than in the previous title.
