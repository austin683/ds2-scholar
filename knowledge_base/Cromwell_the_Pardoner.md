### Cromwell the Pardoner Dialogue

**\- When first met**  
Something seems to be bothering you.  
Yes, yes, I can tell. It is written upon your face.  
You have doubts, about something you did.  
I am Cromwell.  
Regret, anguish, disillusion, bewilderment. What wonderful gifts they are.  
Together, they are the essence of life. Don't you agree?

**\- When talking a second time**  
But now, you are lost, bewildered by your own actions.  
You poor little thing.  
Yes, yes, how tiny and frail are we.  
But if your heart is yet sincere, your sins will be forgiven.  
Now is the chance. Demonstrate your sincerity to me.

**\- When talking to him to open the interaction menu**  
Ask that your sins be forgiven.  
(or)  
I, Cromwell, will pardon your sins.

**\- When leaving, having used his services**  
We must never forget our sins.

**\- When leaving, without having used his services**  
Whenever you are ready.

**\- When walking off without closing the menu**  
You will always find me here.

**\- When asking for pardon**  
You seek indulgence? Then tell me of your transgression.

  1. **Answer "yes"**  
…Your sin has been forgiven.  
May your contrition be sincere and enduring.
  2. **Answer "no"**  
Then, you wish to stand and face your own sins?  
Such virtuous fortitude is rare, and I sincerely commend it.

**\- Using 'Talk' option**  
Anyone can be forgiven, as long as he is sincere.  
No matter how terrible the sin.  
Surely, we all deserve mercy, yes.

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
These are for you.  
We all deserve mercy, every last one of us.

**\- When attacked but not aggroed**  
Oh…  
(or)  
Oh?  
(or)  
Ooph!

**\- When attacked and aggroed**  
You are a cold beast.

Forgive this poor soul…
