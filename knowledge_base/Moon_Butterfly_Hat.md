_"Hat made from wings of the rare moon butterfly. Poisons those who approach its wearer."_

_"Also extends jump distance._ "

_"Little is known about the moon butterfly, which only appears on full-moon nights in winter. Some say the butterfly is a magical being, and its larvae have never once been spotted."_

### Location

  * [Maughlin the Armorer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer), in [Majula](/Majula) (Only available in NG+ & the hat requires NG++ (bonfire intensity 3) after spending 16000+ souls with him. 
    * In other words, you need to burn two Bonfire Ascetics in Majula to get the entire set).

### Notes

  * Part of the [Moon Butterfly Set](/Moon+Butterfly+Set). 
    * Each piece has a special effect (Effect(All): Poison nearby foes, Effect(Wings/Skirt): Increases length of jumping)
    * Leaves poison buildup marking on invisible enemies (needs confirmation)(+confirmed pc 15/6/2014, though since the poison radius is short they're practically on top of you).
  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite).
  * Increases [Intelligence](/Intelligence) by 1.
  * **IMPORTANT** : Take off before approaching any NPC you don't want to aggro. Poison will affect any NPC that you can attack, including the Emerald Herald.
