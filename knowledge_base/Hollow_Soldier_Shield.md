The**Hollow Soldier Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Shield of hollowed royal soldiers. The thing is in tatters, and only serves as a shield in a most minimal respect._

     _The accoutrements of royal soldiers feature a depiction of a brave knight from an old parable."_
