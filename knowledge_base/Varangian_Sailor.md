Varangian Pirates are enemies in Dark Souls II. They can first be encountered near the pier in [No Man's Wharf](/No+Man%27s+Wharf).   
  
_The Varangians were a fierce band of pirates who prowled the seas of Drangleic's northern coastline.They were conquered by a former king who chose to force them into hard labor at No Man's Wharf rather than imprison them.They continue to labor at No Man's Wharf, and still fight with deadly proficiency. Of particular note is their long-range Sea Bow;it was once used against monsters at sea, but it will now be put to use against you…_   
  

  * The Varangians were pirates who terrorized the seas of Drangleic's northern coastline. A former king led a campaign to capture the bandits, and forced them into labor at No Man's Wharf
  * Varangians wield swords, shields, dual cutlasses, and bows. They also throw casks of oil at their targets and attempt to ignite them using fire arrows
  * Varangians have relatively low HP and defenses, but attack and move swiftly. They utilize various weapons and tactics that make them more dangerous than average hollows
  * Varangians fight aggressively and tend to ambush players in groups. They make use of [Stray Hounds](/Stray+Hound) and [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry) to outnumber and overwhelm their opponents 

  
  
  

###  Strategy tips

  

  * Be wary of the oil bombs they throw, if you light your torch/equip your pyromancy glove. you'll explode. the damage isnt a great deal, however it DOES knock you down.
  * Pull one at a time with ranged attack, dodge the oil bomb throws, and go in for the kill.
