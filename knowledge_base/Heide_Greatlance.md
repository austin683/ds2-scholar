**Heide Greatlance is** a **[Lance](/Lances "Dark Souls 2 Lances")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. **Heide Greatlance** in DKS2 is a lance originating from Heide, known for its durability due to a special alloy. It is a rare drop from [Heide Knights](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") found in the Shrine of Winter.

> A lance originating in Heide. A special alloy makes it very durable. The tip of the lance has been extended. The composition of the alloy of these lances remains a mystery, but in Drangleic the attempt to imitate it resulted in the similar bradden steel. Lances are normally wielded by mounted knights and it takes considerable training to handle one on the ground.

### How to get Heide Greatlance in Dark Souls 2

  * Dark Souls 2: Rare [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") drop from the [Shrine of Winter](/Shrine+of+Winter "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Winter") (bonfire intensity 2 or higher). The knight can be respawned by using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") on [Ruined Fork Road](/Ruined+Fork+Road "Dark Souls 2 Ruined Fork Road") Bonfire in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods").
  * Scholar of the First Sin: Dropped from the Heide Knight in [the Gutter](/the+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 the Gutter") (bonfire intensity 2 or higher). The droprate is 100%, but should the knight drop an armor piece, then the Greatlance will not be dropped alongside it. As a result, lowering your item discovery will actually increase the chances of obtaining the weapon.
