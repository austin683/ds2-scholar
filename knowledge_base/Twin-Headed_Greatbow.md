> _A greatbow made of animal bone. The fine craftmanship suggests that it originates in Lanafir._   
>   
>  _The unusual design appears to have ceremonial implications, but may simply be intended to intimidate foes._

###  **Acquired From**

  * DLC: [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King").
  * Past the Illusory Wall after the third bonfire, drop down, turn around and go down the hallway. On the left there will be an enemy standing on a broken ledge. Kill him and look down, drop down to the lower pathway go through the corridor and head to the left and open the chest.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * The pulling speed is much slower than most greatbows, as well as the significantly higher stamina cost.
  * Strength-dedicated greatbow, deals devastating damage at the cost of slow pulling speed.
  * Upgraded with Twinkling Titanite
