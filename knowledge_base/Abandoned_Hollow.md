### Dark Souls 2 Abandoned Hollow (Captive Undead) Information

_“Sword Hollow. The most lowly of the hollows, slow moving and dressed only in minimal rags. Most are bare-handed, though some wield torches. Often feign death or otherwise hide, e.g., by hanging out of sight from a cliff face. Really only a problem in groups or if you forget about them, and they catch you unaware._

_The Undead hunts during the reign of the Iron King took place in this forest, and the cells in which the Undead were held still stand there to this day. However, the march of time has eroded any difference between the captors and the captives”_
