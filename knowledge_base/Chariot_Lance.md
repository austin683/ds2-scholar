### DS2 Chariot Lance Hints and Tips

  * Can not be infused or enchanted
  * Upgraded with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone")

  * The [Grand Lance](/Grand+Lance "Dark Souls 2 Grand Lance") is better if you want to use weapon buffs since chariot can't be enchanted but, if you don't want to do that then Chariot is only 7 damage points behind Grand even if you have 50 STR 50 DEX on top of added bleed.
  * Could be difficult to max out earlier on in the game because it needs petrified dragon bones unlike normal titanite weapons.
  * It is capable of breaking guards more often than the Grand Lance, and has a better reach.
