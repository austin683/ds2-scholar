### Sublime Bone Dust Usage in DKS2

  * If you burn at the [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") bonfire you gain more health from your Estus flasks. (Estus Flask +x amount)
  * Your [Estus Flask](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask") can be boosted to a max of +5 (cannot buff after +5). Further, Sublime Bone Dusts are useless, attempting to burn results in the message "Cannot burn further items".

### Dark Souls 2 Sublime Bone Dust Location

**DARK SOULS II - ORIGINAL**

  * Guaranteed drop from the non-respawning mace-wielding Old Knight at [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame"). It is missable, so if you die before picking it up, you will have to defeat the Dragonrider and use a Bonfire Ascetic. A second one can also be gained if you DID find it and use a Bonfire Ascetic to respawn the knight. However, you will have to defeat the Dragonrider each time, which can be difficult at low levels. (If the Old Knight is killed by gravity he will not drop a Sublime Bone Dust.)
  * [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse"), on a ledge right before the Executioner's Chariot boss.
  * [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch") in a chest found after killing The Rotten.
  * [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"), in a chest found after killing Old Iron King.
  * [Sinners' Rise](/Sinners'+Rise "Dark Souls 2 Sinners' Rise"), after taking the elevator down from the bonfire the dust is located in the first alcove on the left in the water area behind a single enhanced undead.
  * 

**SCHOLAR OF THE FIRST SIN EDITION**

  * In the passage to [No Man's Wharf](/No+Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No Man%27s Wharf"), in an alcove at the left, there is an Iron Chest that is guarded by a Royal Guard.
  * [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"): Inside an Iron Chest where the Great Heal Miracle was before. Before the first Gutter Bonfire, when you get to the Bridge with a hole over a water-filled round-room with exploding mummies - don´t go down the ladder to the right but kill the Warrior to the left and there is the Chest.
  * [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman's+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman's Copse"): From the bridge that you have to lower, go right and drop in the hole of a roof and you will find it in a chest.
  * [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"): From the Shaded Ruins bonfire there is a window at your left that you can jump out of. When you land go to the building at your left, in an Iron Chest.
