**Rosabeth of Melfia** is an [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") in **Dark Souls 2. Rosabeth of Melfia** can be found petrified in the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"). Once freed from her petrified state, she relocates to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), where she sets up a stall near the entrance to the town. **Rosabeth** is a pyromancer and offers pyromancy services to the player, allowing them to purchase [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") and upgrade their pyromancy flame. She is a kind and gentle individual, grateful to the player for freeing her and eager to help them in any way she can. 

### Rosabeth of Melfia Information in Dark Souls 2

  * Can be found Petrified at [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") before the gate to [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"). The path to the Shaded Woods is up the stone steps at the water-side edge of Majula, next to the path back to Things Betwixt.
  * She can sell you [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies"), reinforce your [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") and [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame") if you have [Fire Seeds](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed").
  * You can give her equipment that she will wear in your game. (Unlocks trophy/achievement)
  * She claims to be the student of [Carhillion of the Fold](/Carhillion+of+the+Fold "Dark Souls 2 Carhillion of the Fold"). She came to **Drangleic** following him.
  * You have to give her at least one piece of clothing or armor to make her move to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), in front of the stairs leading up to the cliff-side spire that shows the worldwide player-death count where [Crestfallen Saulden](/Crestfallen+Saulden "Dark Souls 2 Crestfallen Saulden") sits.
  * After giving her a piece of clothing or armor, she gives you a [Prism Stone](/Prism+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Prism Stone") as thanks for rescuing her.
  * If you don't give her any clothing after undoing the petrification, she moves to just outside the room next to where you first meet Benhart.

### Rosabeth of Melfia Encounters in Dark Souls 2

  * **First location.** She is petrified and needs to be freed first. You need [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore"), which you can find in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley") near The Mines bonfire or locked behind a door that needs the [Bastille Key](/Bastille+Key "Dark Souls 2 Bastille Key") you obtain from defeated the [Bell Gargoyles](/Belfry+Gargoyle "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Gargoyle").
  * **Rescue**. After being freed from petrification by the player, she will ask for clothes. Anything you give her will do, but be warned you will never be able to get whatever you give her back. Her clothes could be changed once she has moved to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), but you will lose whatever you gave her before. This is independent of which slot (head, chest, legs, hands) you are giving her and what she had before. F.e. if you only give her a chest-piece before and attempt to add some gloves afterward, the previous chest-piece will be removed. So always gift her all the items you want her to wear at once.
  * **Re-location to Majula**. After giving her fresh clothes (or armour) to wear, Rosabeth will re-locate to the bottom of the steps that lead to the waterfront cliff-side spire in Majula. The player should rest at bonfire to reset the world, in order for Rosabeth to appear in Majula.

### Rosabeth of Melfia Dialogue

**\- First Encounter**

  1. Cough! Cough cough!  
Th-th…Thank…thank you…  
Cough cough!  
I've been…petrified…hard to…speak…  
Cough! Oww…  
Give me…a moment, please!
  2. I'm fine, I think. Hrgg!  
No no no, I'm fine! Really, I am!  
Um, my name is Rosabeth.  
Thank you so much for rescuing me. Phew…
  3. Oh, you're that traveller!  
I still haven't thanked you!  
Well, I'm quite a hand at pyromancy.  
So, perhaps… You could consider this my thanks?
  4. I was attacked, and turned to stone…I think…  
I owe you my life! If you had not come…  
I feel shameful…wearing these rags…
  5. Um…I hate to burden you further, as you've already saved my life…  
But…just look at me, my clothes are in tatters.  
Do you have any clothing that you could spare?  
I'll take anything, whatever you don't need. I'm not particular when it comes to apparel.  
Anything at all will do.  
Just put it on the ground, and I'll change into it later.

**\- Re-encounter in Old Akelarre (before gifting clothes)**  
Er…Could you spare me something to wear?  
Just put it here, and I'll change into it later.

**\- Re-encounter in Old Akelarre (after gifting clothes)**  
I'm going back to Majula.  
I hope we can meet again!

**\- When gifting clothes**  
Thank you so much! I'm very happy for this gift.  
After I change into this, I'm heading for Majula.  
I'm not sure where I might find Milord.  
But perhaps Majula is my best chance.

**\- Meeting again in Majula**  
Oh! There you are!  
I'm here in Majula thanks entirely to you.  
You even were kind enough to clothe me. Thank you so very much.  
The only thing I can offer is pyromancy, but if that might help you, come to me.

**\- Re-encounter in Majula**  
Hello! Do you require pyromancy?  
(or)  
Yes! How may I help you?  
(or)  
I'm glad to see you're well!  
(or)  
Hello again! How have you been?

**\- Using Talk Option (Old Akelarre)**

  1. I have my very own teacher.  
His name is Carhillion of the Fold, a famed sorcerer in Melfia, our home town.  
I was fascinated by sorcery! And so…! Well, he's so unique, you see…  
When he set out for Drangleic, I couldn't let him go alone.  
But we were separated…quite early on, I'm afraid…
  2. I'm rather unskilled…Milord probably ditched me.  
But oddly, I'm a fast learner when it comes to pyromancy.  
What we're fascinated by, and we're skilled at, are not always the same thing.  
Why can't I just focus on what I truly enjoy?  
Ooh, dear, I shouldn't be so choosy!  
It's hardly my place…

**\- Using Talk Option (Majula)**  
It was a perilous trek across the mountains.  
I faced the most frightful things…  
The number of times I nearly died! Tee hee!

**\- Using Talk Option after Carhillion returns to Majula**

  1. I finally tracked down my teacher.  
But I've decided to keep at it alone.  
I need to see what I can achieve by myself.
  2. Master Carhillion and I are from Melfia, to the south. A land lush with sorcery and pyromancy.  
Master Carhillion polished his art at one of our renowned magic academies.  
But he argued that the academies were terrible places to learn magic…  
This quite angered Master Glocken, my previous teacher…
  3. Once, Master Carhillion spoke excitedly of this land.  
He made talk of the remnants…of some great power, and the deep abyss that surrounds it.  
I tried to ask more… But he didn't seem to hear.  
…I'll never be good enough, will I…

**\- Leaving after menu interaction**  
Be safe.

**\- Leaving after using services (Majula)**  
I'm always here, so come and see me when you're in town!

**\- Leaving without exiting menu**  
Wait! Where are you…cough…

**\- When attacked**  
 _Ouch!_ (no caption)  
How could you… (aggroed)  
B-but why? (50% HP)

**\- Re-encounter after defeat**  
I won't let you do this…

**\- When killed**  
 _dying groan_ (no caption)

### Rosabeth of Melfia Notes

  * Armor with special effects will work on Rosabeth as well as the player, so it is advised to **not** give her harmful pieces such as the moon butterfly set (as you will get poisoned while near her as long as she is wearing it) or the symbol of avarice (as it will slowly kill her).

### Dark Souls 2 Rosabeth of Melfia Trivia

  * [Rosabeth's Dress](/Rosabeth's+Dress "Dark Souls 2 Rosabeth's Dress") is a [Unique armor piece](/Unique+Armor+Pieces "Dark Souls 2 Unique Armor Pieces") that she wears when unpetrified. Although in the games files with both a description and model it cannot be obtained through normal method.
