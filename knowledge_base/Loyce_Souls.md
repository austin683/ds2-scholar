#  Loyce Soul

_[Items](/Items "Dark Souls 2 Items") >>_   
  
_"Soul of the Knights of Loyce._   
_The Knights of Loyce were taken by Chaos, and lost all sense of purpose and being._   
_The few woeful souls that trudged back home were guided by some faint vestige of self._   
_This soul is pure sorrow, and only Alsanna can put it to rest."_   
  
**Usage**

  * Bring the souls to [Alsanna, Silent Oracle](/Alsanna%2C+Silent+Oracle "Dark Souls 2 Alsanna%2C Silent Oracle"), who will reward you for the amount of souls possessed. The stairs leading to [Alsanna, Silent Oracle](/Alsanna%2C+Silent+Oracle "Dark Souls 2 Alsanna%2C Silent Oracle") will open up as you bring more souls.
  * Consumable but it gains no Soul and it is not possible to sell it to [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan").

  
**Rewards**

  * **5** x Loyce Soul = [Loyce Gauntlets](/Loyce+Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Gauntlets")
  * **5** x Loyce Soul = [Loyce Leggings](/Loyce+Leggings "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Leggings")
  * **15** x Loyce Soul = [Loyce Armor](/Loyce+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Armor")
  * **35** x Loyce Soul = [Loyce Helm](/Loyce+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Helm")
  * **50** x Loyce Soul = [Soul of Alsanna, Silent Oracle](/Soul+of+Alsanna "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Alsanna"), access to [Ivory King Armor](/Ivory+king+armor "Dark Souls 2 Ivory king armor")

  
**Location:**

  * **Dropped by** the [Charred Loyce Knight](/Charred+Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Knight") enemies.
  * **DLC Item** : [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King")

  
**Farming Strategies:**   
Preparation 

  * Ensure the [Burnt Ivory King](/Burnt+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Burnt Ivory King") is alive so the [Loyce Knights](/Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Knight") are present. Before the boss appearance, 12 [Charred Loyce Knights](/Charred+Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Knight") are generated. During the boss fight, they will spawn almost infinitely (45 times) but at a slower rate.
  * If the [Burnt Ivory King](/Burnt+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Burnt Ivory King") is dead, only 3 [Charred Loyce Knights](/Charred+Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Knight") will spawn in [old chaos](/old+chaos "Dark Souls 2 old chaos").at a time. If you are patient they continue spawning every couple of minutes.
  * First of all, you'll need to increase the [Item Discovery](/Item+Discovery "Dark Souls 2 Item Discovery") rate, try wearing [Jester's Cap](/Jester%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Jester%27s Set"), [Prisoner's Tatters](/Prisoner%27s+Tatters "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner%27s Tatters"), [Watchdragon Parma](/Watchdragon+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Watchdragon Parma") (SotFS), [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring +2](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring"), [Symbol of Avarice](/Symbol+of+Avarice "Dark Souls 2 Symbol of Avarice")
  * You may use [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin") (can be farmed at Tower of Prayer bonfire) to raise the drop rate (+1% for 5 min).
  * You want to have enough physical and fire protection to survive. Try [Ring of Steel Protection +2](/Ring+of+Steel+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Steel Protection"), [Flame Quartz Ring +2](/Flame+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flame Quartz Ring").
  * Now for weapons, [Charred Loyce Knights](/Charred+Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Knight") are completely vulnerable to [Dark Crypt Blacksword +5](/Crypt+Blacksword "Dark Souls 2 Crypt Blacksword") buffed with [Dark Weapon](/Dark+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Dark Weapon"), you may consider using [Affinity](/Affinity "Dark Souls 2 Affinity") at the beginning.
  * Freeing all four [Loyce Knights](/Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Knight") can help during the fights as they aggro well the ennemies.

  
Solo 

  * Follow the Loyce Knights so you won't get crowded by Charred Loyce Knights that easily, and you can sweep the enemies when they're staggered.
  * Loyce Knights are acted as distractions rather than actual help, treat them as human shields and sweep the charred knights behind the crowd.
  * If your health is halved, hide behind the crowd but don't go too far, drink your [Estus Flask](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask") twice or more to heal faster.
  * Once the portal of the Burnt Ivory King appears, quit the field with [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather")
  * Rinse and repeat, they drop Loyce Souls regularly under this condition.

  
Multi 

  * It is possible to summon phantoms at the [Grand Cathedral](/Grand+Cathedral "Dark Souls 2 Grand Cathedral") bonfire. After the fight and before the boss appears, when the floor starts shaking, use the[ Black Separation Crystal ](/Black+Separation+Crystal "Dark Souls 2 Black Separation Crystal")to banish any summoned phantoms. This will give the host enough time to use the [aged feather](/aged+feather "Dark Souls 2 aged feather"). This strategy allows both phantoms and the host to farm souls quickly.
  * You can also summon the NPCs near the bonfire and the drop rate seems to increase by quite a bit with them present. When all the knights are dead cast yourself off the edge. This strategy works best with Vendricks Blessing so you don't turn hollow or if you have an excess of human effigies to spare.

  
**Note:**

  * It seems that Loyce Souls drop more often on higher NG+ cycles, especially when [Burnt Ivory King](/Burnt+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Burnt Ivory King") is alive.
  * They can still be dropped from Charred Loyce Knights whilst summoned as a phantom.
  * Much higher drop rate if help as phantom, even without farming gear.
  * Using the Symbol of Avarice, will allow you to farm both souls and items with better rates. Get yourself summoned and farm the knights.
  * In Scholar of the First Sin, joining the covenant of champions makes the knights spawn infinitely. (Doesn't seem to work after [Burnt Ivory King](/Burnt+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Burnt Ivory King") is killed)
