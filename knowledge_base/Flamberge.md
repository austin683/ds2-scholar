**Flamberge** is a **[Greatsword](/Greatswords "Dark Souls 2 Greatswords")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Flamberge** in DS2 is a distinctive Greatsword featuring an undulating blade designed for effective flesh-cutting, particularly causing bleeding in its victims. Upgradeable with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10, the **Flamberge** can be enhanced further by infusing it with a Bleed Stone and equipping the [Crest of Blood Ring](/Crest+of+Blood "Dark Souls 2 Crest of Blood") and [Shadow Gauntlets](/Shadow+Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Gauntlets") to maximize bleed damage. 

> A greatsword with an undulating blade. The unique shape is designed to pare the flesh, and is highly effective at causing bleeding.   
>   
> Flamberge literally means "flame blade," but it also seems to bear a certain creature's likeness.

### How to get Flamberge in Dark Souls 2

  * Sold by [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") for 4200 souls in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle")
  * SoTFS: Found in the Huntsman's Copse. In the area where Merciless Roena invades and where you find the Undead Lockaway Key, look directly below the poison butterfly (if you kill him, the poison moss he drops should drop on the platform). Try falling _sideways._ It easier and stops your character from simply sliding off.
