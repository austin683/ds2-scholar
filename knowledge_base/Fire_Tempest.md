**Fire Tempest** is a [Pyromancy](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Fire Tempest** , an ancient and primal pyromancy. Unleashes giant pillars of flame near the caster, incinerating all life in its wake. [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") are offensive fire spells that do not demand [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith") or [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") prerequisites and can be executed with a [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") or [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame"). The fire damage scales with [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"), yet there are no specific stat requirements for casting pyromancies. However, opponents resistant to fire damage remain unaffected by [Pyromancy Spells](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies").

  * From the [Crumbled Ruins](/Crumbled+Ruins "Dark Souls 2 Crumbled Ruins"), follow the sunken path leading to the nearby hut (the player does not need to engage with the Ogre, but will observe the ogre on the right while walking up to the hut).   
  
Go through the hut and open the door on the other end.   
  
From this door, take a sharp right into the (seemingly) empty water. There will be several [cursed urns](/Cursed+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Cursed Vessel") in the water if the player is headed in the correct direction.
