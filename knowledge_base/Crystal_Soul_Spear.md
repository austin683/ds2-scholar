### Crystal Soul Spear Notes & Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Shoots a projectile spell that deals magic damage. Can pierce through multiple enemies. An upgrade to [Soul Spear](/Soul+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Soul Spear"). It is the highest damaging single projectile-type sorcery in the game. The casting speed is roughly the same as [Great Heavy Soul Arrow](/Great+Heavy+Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Great Heavy Soul Arrow"). Has a chance to pierce through shields with 100% Magic damage reduction, especially [Magic Shield](/Magic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Magic Shield") under Magic infusion.
  * Multiple scrolls can be obtained by using [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") on [The Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja").
  * At 53 int and with [Staff of Wisdom](/Staff+of+Wisdom "Dark Souls 2 Staff of Wisdom") +4 it only deals 25% more damage than the normal [Soul Spear](/Soul+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Soul Spear") but requires twice the attunement slots.
  * As of Calibration 1.10, this spell requires two attunement slots, and its casting time has been increased. A mistranslation of the patch caused confusion concerning the reduced damage. The correct translation notes the reduction was only to [poise](/poise "Dark Souls 2 poise") damage. With 99 INT and a Magic [Staff of Wisdom](/Staff+of+Wisdom "Dark Souls 2 Staff of Wisdom") +5, Crystal Soul Spear does the same 1011 damage to [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord") that it did before the patch.
