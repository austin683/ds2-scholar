### Aava, the King's Pet Attacks in DKS2
    
    
    | Attack Name | Attack Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Homing Ice Crystals | Runs farther away and roars, conjuring five Ice Crystals that launch a few seconds after at their target, every crystal tracking the player. / Getting hit knocks the player down and thus the rest of them will miss. (With high poise you might get hit by more than one) |
    | Leaping Ice Swipe | Runs farther away like with Ice Crystals. Instead of conjuring crystals she leaps at the player and swipes with her paw. |
    | Leaping Ice Slam | Runs away in a manner like the Ice Swipe. Instead of swiping you, leaps at you and slams into the ground with her front right paw. Has a large, lingering hitbox around 270 degrees on the right side of her body. |
    | Ice Swipe | Swipes the area in front of her; can chain another swipe with her other paw. / Note: If she decides to change target and swipe at the same time, she can do a 180' degree turn. |
    | Ice Smash | Smashes the ground with her paw, summoning little ice pools around her which erupt an ice spike after a few seconds. |
    | Ice Explosion | After a short, stationary charging animation, she emits an icy explosion, dealing damage to and knocking back everyone around her. |
    | Bite attack | She leaps away and then leaps towards you with her mouth open. If you are too close to her head when she lands, you will be sucked in her mouth and suffer heavy damage. |
    

### Dark Souls 2 Aava, the King's Pet Strategy

Melee Strategy for Aava: It is important to note that Aava can take away a great deal of health if any of the hits connect. Aava is a melee-oriented boss, so a shield with good damage reduction is recommended to soak up the majority of the damage being dealt. If you’re a dual weapon user, then it is important to have high agility (minimum of 92) to help you when rolling away from attacks.   
  
Now, the first order of business is to lock-on to Aava. This is important, as all your attacks will want to be focused directly Aava. Now that you've locked on, you must **_ALWAYS_** stay near the hind legs (the back legs) as Aava will only have 3 methods of attack to get you from there: she can use ice explosion which can and will damage you if you're behind her, as well as her ice smash attack, Aava will move her body to the side that is opposite to your side and do a claw sweep that will force her to directly face you. When this happens you have three things to do (depending on your build):   
  
**If you’re a tank with a shield:** Raise your shield as soon as you notice Aava moving her body slightly to the side. When she attacks, your shield will soak up the damage and you can then proceed to sprint to her hind legs once again.   
  
**If you’re a dual weapon user:** Roll to the front of Aava or to the away from her. If you roll to the front, you’ll get underneath Aava ( **DO. NOT. ATTACK.)** , just simply roll to the side and repeat the process of attack that’s already been mentioned.   
  
**If you're a mage:** Use phantoms to distract her, and then proceed to stagger her with Dark Hail, Block its magic with a shield that has good Magic defenses in order to absorb the majority of the damage. It is vital that you stay at a far away range from Aava, if she begins to focus on you, it is recommended to roll through her attacks OR use a shield to block the damage she may inflict on you. Retreat to a safe position while phantoms begin to distract her.   
  
Aava also has a long-range attack. She will summon 5 soul spears, which will all fire in rapid succession of each other towards the player. When she summons them, just move behind her and 90% of the time they miss. If you're too far away to make it behind her, sprint to the left or the right and they should all miss you.   
  
  
Alternate Melee Strategy: (Used at SL138 with Throne Watcher's Armor set +2, fire-infused Heide Longsword +10 and fire-infused Blue Flame +5, Chloranthy ring +1, Fire Clutch Ring and Old Leo Ring on a STR/DEX 40 build)   
\--(Feel free to use any combination of dual-wielded fire-infused weapons, my setup would have been better with a Fire Longsword instead of Heide Longsword)   
  
You will want a fire-infused weapon for this, and a shield is optional as her attacks will very easily stagger you if blocked. For this reason, dual-wielding and powerstancing with fire weapons is preferable. Lighter, faster weapons are recommended, as you will have more time to dodge after your strike. If you can use Flame Weapon, use it. If not, the only other buff that is useful is Crystal Magic Weapon: it adds both physical and magic damage, and she resists both magic and Dark damage.   
  
First, summon the two NPCs available for the fight; they serve as meat shields and will likely die before the end of the fight. As soon as the fight starts, lock on to Aava and stay that way for the rest of the fight. While Aava concentrates on them (she always turns her head to face her target), stand far enough away that you're out of her spinning swipe range, as this should be the only move that could hit you while she isn't targeting you (other than her AoE ice spike which is easy to dodge), but close enough that you can run in for a few hits. (Using a straight sword, you may feel like you have time enough to go for 4-5 hits, but her spinning swipe has next to no warning, so stay with 2-3 hits). As soon as she finishes her combo, dash in for a few hits to her side. Quickly back away once you finish. **DO NOT** strike at her flank: she will begin targeting you after doing a backward leap/leaping bite combo if you do. Only strike at her side; the left side seems the best choice. Keep this up until the NPC Phantoms die, which should happen after she is at about 1/3 health.   
  
Once the NPC Phantoms die, Aava will begin targeting you. **DO NOT STRAFE** at this point. She will unleash holy hell and wreck your ass with AoEs if you do. Allow her to use her biting and clawing attacks (she typically does either 2 swipes or a bite followed by 2 swipes) while facing her head-on. Simply back away before she strikes and after the combo, strike her face 1-2 times and repeat. The only moves you need to worry about are her back jumps followed by leaping bites, which are highly telegraphed but have a deceptively wide hit-box, her leaping swipes, and her spin attacks, which have almost no warning and a lagging hitbox extending **ALL THE WAY TO HER OPPOSITE SHOULDER** (she shouldn't use this unless you strafe). Move backward, not to the side, to avoid both of these. When you see her leap back, **DO NOT APPROACH** unless she is charging her soul spears, in which case you need to run forwards and roll between her legs, hit 1-2 times, and quickly move away once the attack is finished.   
  
Optimal healing times are while she uses her ice spike AoE, which can be triggered by attacking her hind legs (not her flank or side, but in between the two) and her spin swipe, which can be avoided once you know how to trigger it and can predict when she will use it. This should take no more than 2-3 minutes.

### Aava, the King's Pet Hints in Dark Souls 2

  * Without the [Eye of the Priestess](/Eye+of+the+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Eye of the Priestess"), the player can barely see Aava. It is possible, although very hard, to see Aava's very faint outline.
  * Even with a good shield Aava will most likely drain your stamina completely after 1-2 hits (especially in NG+ and further). However, the Baneful Bird Ring might allow an additional blocked hit, especially for smaller shields.
  * If she has summoned her Ice Missiles, just walk to the side of Aava. Normally none of them should hit you.
  * Aava is very resistant to all elemental damage - dark orb does 25% dmg only and the other 3 elements seem to be no better.
  * However, [Dark Hail](/Dark+Hail "Dark Souls 2 Dark Hail") is actually handy for staggering Aava.
  * It is highly recommended to get your magic resistance as close to 900 as possible to minimize damage from her spells.
  * [Magic Shield](/Magic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Magic Shield") and [Rebel's Greatshield](/Rebel%27s+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Rebel%27s Greatshield") infused with Magic makes this fight almost trivial, as both provide 100% magic damage reduction.
  * Fighting Aava with under 92 [Agility](/Agility "Dark Souls 2 Agility") is incredibly difficult, most notably; the Leaping Ice Slam attack is **impossible** to avoid via dodge iframes, level up [Adaptability](/Adaptability "Dark Souls 2 Adaptability") or equip some combination of the [Peasant's Set](/Peasant+Set "Dark Souls 2 Peasant Set"), [Simpleton's Ring](/Simpleton's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton's Ring") and/or [Handmaid's Ladle](/Handmaid's+Ladle "Dark Souls 2 Handmaid's Ladle") if you are running SL1 until you have sufficient Agility to avoid being hit.
  * Can be poisoned, took 19 arrows.
