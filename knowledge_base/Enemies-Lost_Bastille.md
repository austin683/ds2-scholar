## Lost Bastille Enemies

  

  

###  [Gaoler](/Gaoler) (Undead Jailer)

  

Gaolers are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered on a wooden watchtower beyond the [Exile Holding Cells](/Exile+Holding+Cells) bonfire.   
  
_The Undead Jailers of the Lost Bastille carry primitive weapons intended to instill fear and can even use pyromancy to burn escapees, and intruders, to a crisp. The Jailers are wrapped in bandages. What lies beneath? Have they been burned by their own flames, or are they hiding a darker secret?_   
  

  * Gaolers are prison wardens of the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille). They wield great, brutish machetes to evoke fear in prisoners who dare to escape 
  * Gaolers have adequate amounts of HP, move fairly quickly, and deal significant damage. Their polearms give their attacks great range
  * Gaolers tend to poke players at long range, sweep at close range, and attempt to grab and chase players at close to medium range
  * Gaolers have great reach with their weapons, but their attacks and turning speed are sluggish. They can also be staggered by consecutive attacks

  

  

###  [Stray Hound](/Stray+Hound) (Stray Dog)

  

Stray Hounds are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered beyond the [Exile Holding Cells](/Exile+Holding+Cells) bonfire, beside a wooden watchtower.   
  
_Don't let the name fool you; this demonic hound is anything from ordinary.Whether this is the specis' natural state or a result of some darker power is irrelevant;it wants to rip your throat out_   
  

  * Stray Hounds are dogs that have turned hollow. Before the undead curse spread, these animals served some purpose relevant to their locations
  * Stray Hounds have meager HP and damage, but can outrun players and attack in quick succession. They are usually found in packs
  * Stray Hounds will attempt to chase, leap at, and bite their opponents. Their attacks cause bleed buildup, 
  * Stray Hounds, although dangerous head on, are easily taken down when attacking from their flanks. They cannot turn very quickly.
  * Stray Hounds, like most undead, are weak against fire.

  

  

###  [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight)

  

Heide Knights are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered after climbing a ladder beyond the [The Crestfallen's Retreat](/The+Crestfallen%27s+Retreat) bonfire.   

  * Heide Knights served as protectors for the ancient Heide kingdom. However, their land sunk into the sea long ago, and only time distortion could explain their presence in Drangleic.
  * Heide Knights' equipment is made of a special alloy that is incredibly durable. Even after thousands of years, weapons and armors found in game have not deteriorated.
  * Heide Knights are non-hostile until attacked by players.
  * Heide Knights have high HP, swift attacks and movement, and deal significant damage. They can surprise and stagger players with their combos.
  * Heide Knights, although proficient in close ranged combat, have no ranged attacks. They can also be parried and backstabbed.

  
In Scholar of the First Sin, they appear in Heide's tower, and, while generally non-hostile to begin with, some do attack on sight, and the rest will become hostile and roam the area after the Dragon Rider is killed. They no longer have a 100% drop.

  

  

###  [Royal Swordsman](/Royal+Swordsman)

  

_The Royal Swordsman were chosen from the bravest of King Vendrick's men, and provided them with the best armor available for the war against the Giants. However, very few survived the battles. While they may be no match for Giants, they still pose a threat when they attack you in numbers_   
  
Royal Swordsmen are encountered in [The Lost Bastille](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Lost+Bastille) and [Drangleic Castle](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Drangleic+Castle). They are often found in teams of around 3-4 soldiers and they will work together to overwhelm the player. They wield greatswords and crossbows.   
Though both of them look alike, the Castle variant are more aggressive and can do more damage. Standing their ground when using the crossbow and switching weapons only when the player approaches within a few units of distance.   
  
They are weak to Thrust (i.e. Spears) type attacks. 

  

  

###  [Rupturing Hollow](/Rupturing+Hollow) (Undead Citizen)

  

Mummified hollows which, when they detect a player, charge them at high speed. You can detect them early by the rattling of their chains. Often occur in groups.
