It scales primarily with [Strength](/Strength "Dark Souls 2 Strength"). With a slash-oriented attack style, it offers effectiveness in close-quarters combat.

> Curved sword of warrior Vengarl of Forossa.   
>   
>  This sword is battle-worn and terribly rusted,but remains a deadly weapon owing to its incredible weight.   
>   
>  Legend has it that it was built to test the limits of the strength of Forossa knights, until Vengarl swung it about like a wooden plaything, claiming ownership by demonstration. 

###  **Acquired From**

  * Sold by [Vengarl of Forossa](/Head+of+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Head of Vengarl") for 7500 souls after defeating his body. 
    * Standard: Body is found after defeating the [Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke's+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke's Dear Freja"), in the primal bonfire chamber
    * SOTFS: Body can be found in the shaded woods, after using a Fragrant Branch of Yore on a Lion Warrior statue, following the narrow corridor near [Man-Scorpion Tark](/Manscorpion+Tark "Dark Souls 2 Manscorpion Tark"), where the Gold Lion Warrior was located in the original game.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Reinforces with [twinkling titanite](/twinkling+titanite "Dark Souls 2 twinkling titanite") to +5
  * Uses [Falchion](/Falchion "Dark Souls 2 Falchion") moveset.
  * Can be used to Power Stance with a large selection of weapons, similarly to the [Warped Sword](/Warped+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Warped Sword"). Works with Red Rust Scimitar in either hand, and uses the Curved Sword L2/LT power stance attack if used with a Dagger/Axe/Thrusting Sword in the other hand. Otherwise the L2/LT attack will be that of the other weapon's type. If used with [Red Rust Sword](/Red+Rust+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Red Rust Sword"), which ever is in the Right hand will dictate the power stance L2/LT.
