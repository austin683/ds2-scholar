### Falconer (Hollow Falconer) Information in Dark Souls 2

_"Falconers are mercenaries from the city of Volgen, usually hired as bodyguards for the elite. The ones found in the fields, however, are hollow, and have no sense of their former duties  
Falconers are equipped with swords, bows, and a falcon that can attack the player. They draw their swords at close range, fire arrows at long range, and send falcons at mid-range  
Players must deal with multiple falconers at once when starting NG+, so players would do well to prevent getting surrounded by them_ _"_
