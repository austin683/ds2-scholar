**Splintering Lightning Spear** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a [chime](/Chimes "Dark Souls 2 Chimes") or special weapons that can cast Miracles.

> _"Developed from a primal miracle. Launch splintering spears of lightning._  
> _Ever since miracles came to be, learned men have endeavored to rework and remold them to their satisfaction. This is one such effort"_

### Acquired From

  * After the second bonfire of the [Crown of the Ivory King, ](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King")there is a tower located above the drop-down to the bridge where the player finds the [Eye of the Priestess.](/Eye+of+the+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Eye of the Priestess")  
Climbing up the ladder attached to the tower leads to a metal chest containing this miracle. The ladder is unseen before obtaining the Eye, but can still be used.

### Notes

  * Despite being named Splintering Lightning Spear, this miracle bears little resemblance to the other Lightning Spear-type miracles. When fired, this spear creates a sigil above your targeted enemy (if locked on) which rains lightning bolts in a tight radius, almost like a concentrated form of [heavenly thunder](/Heavenly+Thunder "Dark Souls 2 Heavenly Thunder"), albeit slightly weaker.
