#  Chapel Threshold

##  Location:

(Brief location summary and how to reach)   
  
This bonfire only spawns items and enemies on the upper platforms and a few of the upper rooms near the bonfire.   
  
Nothing in or above the cathedral   
  
Its pretty useless for anything but farming the bat staff or the Tseldora set, and a bit of titanite   
  
2 Blue Crystal Lizards spawn here, including a petrified bone   
  
Nothing on the ground spawns, no basilisks, so this is not a viable firedrake stone farming bonfire
