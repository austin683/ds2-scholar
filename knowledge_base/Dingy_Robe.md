_"An unassuming dingy hood/robe/cuffs._

_Although by now gray with soot and nearly unraveled, its fabric was originally a pure white"_

_"An unassuming dingy skirt._  _Originally pure white._

_A close inspection reveals old dried blood. What tragedy could have befallen its original owner?"_

### Location

  * Only obtainable in NG+, using a Bonfire Ascetic (at the second Bonfire of Grave of Saints, at least) will not cause the Black Phantoms to appear.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Dingy Set](/Dingy+Set).
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore).
  * Starts at +5 when obtained from NG+ Black Phantom.
