_Armor of unknown origin. Belonged to Benhart of Jugo._

_Apparently Benhart found this while wandering land to land, but its origins are unknown. He wore it all the time, he adored it so, leaving a slight odor._

### Location

  * Complete Benhart's achievement, "Moonlight Greatsword" by successfully defeating three bosses with him, then speak to him in the [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro).
  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia) upon Benhart's death.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Benhart's Set](/Benhart's+Set).
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite)
  * The family crest is same as [Creighton's Set](/Creighton%27s+Set), while Creighton's Set is a replica of Mirrah's armor and the replica's description stated the origin of the crest, Benhart found this while traveling outdoor, this is believed to be the true Mirrah's armor.
  * Benhart spoke out his homeland was in the far east, probably referred to Mirrah, perhaps he's actually a Knight of Mirrah, or a person struggling to find his origin, or, he's a part of the memory.
