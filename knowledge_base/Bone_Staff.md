### How to get Bone Staff in Dark Souls 2

  * [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille") \- In a large dark room with a Pharros Contraption that lights it up. The staff is found in one of the three chests in this room; the other chests contain a [Parrying Dagger](/Parrying+Dagger "Dark Souls 2 Parrying Dagger") and a [Twinblade](/Twinblade "Dark Souls 2 Twinblade").  

    * From the Exile Holding Cells bonfire: Proceed across the battlements then either climb down to the courtyard or drop down by landing on the wooden towers, clearing out the Royal Swordsmen along the way. A [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") will spawn in that courtyard if you haven't already beaten it. Smash down the boarded-up doorway near where the Pursuer spawned, then use the [Antiquated Key](/Antiquated+Key "Dark Souls 2 Antiquated Key") to unlock the door going forward. Past the well you can climb up a short ladder onto a side roof, then jump through the window to a balcony overlooking the room interior. Turn right, roll through the barrel into a narrow passageway that then leads into the big dark room described above.

### DS2 Bone Staff Hints and Tips

  * The heavy weight and slow casting speed make the [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff#fex "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff#fex") better than this staff in nearly every way for a hexer.* However, it does have higher sorcery adjust, making it slightly better for users of both hexes and sorceries unless you infused it with Dark. Still, inferior to [Transgressor's Staff](/Transgressor%27s+Staff#fex "Dark Souls 2 Transgressor%27s Staff#fex") and [Black Witch's Staff](/Black+Witch%27s+Staff#fex "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch%27s Staff#fex")
  * Upgrades with regular titanite.
  * According to official art book, it is supposed to be a belonging of [Rosabeth](/Rosabeth+of+Melfia "Dark Souls 2 Rosabeth of Melfia"), as a gift granted by her master [Carhillion](/Carhillion+of+the+Fold "Dark Souls 2 Carhillion of the Fold"), somehow the idea is scrapped.
  * Only 280 magic bonus with 50 int.
  * 404 dark with 30/30
