## Huntman's Copse Enemies

  

  

###  Dark Spirit - [Greatsword Phantom](/Greatsword%C2%A0Phantom)

  

The non-invading Dark Spirit wielding a greatsword and greatshield, guarding the fog gate to the Executioner`s Chariot.   
  
_This phantom stands watch over the entrance to the Undead Purgatory. His origin is unknown, but he is currently standing guard over the entrance to the domain of Nahr Alma's followers_

  

  

###  [Executioner](/Executioner) (Torturer)

  

_These wicked Torturers don`t wield conventional weapons -- the tools of their trade are intended to inflict pain upon their Undead victims rather than death. If you underestimate them, you`ll find that regardless of their intention, they certainly can kill you._

  

  

###  [Abandoned Hollow](/Abandoned+Hollow) (Captive Undead)

  

Sword Hollow. The most lowly of the hollows, slow moving and dressed only in minimal rags. Most are bare-handed, though some wield torches. Often feign death or otherwise hide, e.g., by hanging out of sight from a cliff face. Really only a problem in groups or if you forget about them, and the catch you unawares.   
  
_The Undead hunts during the reign of the Iron King took place in this forest, and the cells in which the Undead were held still stand there to this day. However, the march of time has eroded any difference between the captors and the captives_

  

  

###  [Hollow Mage (Black)](/Hollow+Mage+%28Black%29) (Necromancer)

  

Black Hollow Mage will not only cast powerful sorceries at the player but will also reanimate nearby skeletons with necromancy. They will not respawn so killing them is top priority if you don't want to have to deal with an endless stream of skeletons. however, it implies that getting their hood, robe and staff is extremely difficult. however, they do respawn in [Undead Purgatory](/Undead+Purgatory) as long as [Executioner's Chariot](/Executioners+Chariot) is alive. Their white counterpart can be seen [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora), although their hoods are entirely different.   
  
They used to be Drangleic Mages, but they are now tainted by the effects of Hollowing. Keeping to traditions of their old life, Hollow Mages' genders can be distinguished by the color of their robes; Black Hollow Mages are confirmed to be female, and they follow the Old King. Their duty is to resurrect the dead in the purgatory so the others can hunt for them for leisure. In contrast, White Hollow Mages are male. They reside in Tseldora and are conducting experiments on spider and sorcery; their roles are identical to that of the Channeler.   
  
Unlike their counterpart in _Dark Souls_ , which primarily uses pyromancy and reanimating the dead with no sigil, this time, they primarily uses sorcery, and every time when they reanimate the dead, they now have a gesture, a purple aura identical to Soul Geyser's charing smoke, wielded with both hand and plunging to the ground, in a manner of two handed strong attack, a purple sigil identical to the one from Heal miracle will appear (not the case in Beta), now the corpses are once again lived, oddly, you cannot perform the same moveset with their staff...   
  
_"The origin of these Necromancers is unknown, but it is possible that they served the Old King during the Undead Hunts in this forest. They are found near Skeleton Lords' domain - perhaps they now serve them as their new masters"_   
_\- Dark Souls 2 Collector's Edition Guide_

###  [Hollow Rogue](/Hollow+Rogue) (Rogue)

  

_Dangerous in life as thieves and highwaymen, these Rogues are now doubly so in death, as Hollowing has robbed them of their reason.  
In life, they may have lusted after material wealth, but in death they seek your very Soul._   
  
The undead rogues are figures that wear dark trousers and brown clothing with a hood. Most dual wield fast small weapons while some carry small ranged weapons that fire either arrows or bolts. They often attack in groups. They are found in Huntsman's Copse. 

  

  

###  [Skeleton](/Skeleton) (Skeleton)

  

Skeletons are enemies in Dark Souls II. They can first be encountered in the basement of the [Majula Mansion](/Majula+Mansion). They are reanimated remains of humanoids, and manifestations of necromancy. In most cases, if a skeleton is nearby, so is a [Hollow Mage (Black)](/Hollow+Mage+%28Black%29). This is not true for the [Majula](/Majula) and [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley) skeleton. Those that are slain can be revived repeatedly by a nearby [Hollow Mage (Black)](/Hollow+Mage+%28Black%29), until the Hollow Mage is killed. Skeletons are relatively weak, both in damage and HP, but move and attack swiftly. They also have the ability to parry, if carrying a shield. They are extremely resilient to thrust (i.e. spear) based attacks, somewhat resistant to slash (i.e. sword) based attacks, and weak against strike (i.e. mace) based attacks. Oddly, skeletons are vulnerable to [Yearn](/Yearn) and [Alluring Skull](/Alluring+Skull), as they're mindless, in short, [Force](/Force) can dispatch them by pushing them to bottomless pit.   
  
_"This curved sword-wielding Skeleton is hiding in Cale's house in Majula. It's unknown whose Skeleton this might be or what force animates it; perhaps Cale inadvertently disturbed this poor soul's resting place. Either way, it must be dispatched before Cale will return to the residence… and if you want the treasures it guards." - Majula Skeleton Description_   
  
_"These reanimated corpses are often under the control of a Necromancer, and they will be revived repeatedly until their Wizard is killed. Whether they served the Iron King or fled from his troops in life makes no difference now, as they are the property of their necromantic masters" - Huntsman's Copse Skeleton Description_   
  
_The skeletons in this region are of unknown origins. They could be former subjects of the Iron King who were worked to death in the poisonous mines or poor Souls who wandered in more recently. Regardless, whether it was the massive Pools of Poison or giant monsters overseeing the Laborers, something killed these poor fools… but they've left it to you to finish the job." - Harvest Valley Skeleton Description_

**N** **ote on Names:**   
This wiki uses the name "Skeleton" to refer to all skeletons in the game.   
FarFire and FuturePress use "Helmed Skeleton" and "Armored Skeleton", respectively, in referring to the later game skeletons in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse). 

  

  

###  [Poison Moth](/Poison+Moth) (Great Moth)

  

Moon Butterflies that sit in the trees and periodically emit a cloud of poisonous spores. Poison can build up very quickly if you're not aware of where and when the clouds will spawn, so exercise caution, or just kill them with ranged weapons as they die very easily, the armor [Moon Butterfly Set](/Moon+Butterfly+Set) is based on this creature. 

  

  

###  [Undead Huntsman](/Undead+Huntsman) (Artificial Undead)

  

_A massive, hulking beast of an Undead, this creature is disturbingly unnatural. This patchwork monstrosity wields two Full Moon Sickles and swings them with immense power.Who would create such a monster? The Iron King himself sought to destroy the Undead, not create them…_   
  
Giant hollows wielding twin sickles. Slow, but powerful and can easily kill an unprepared player. They also do bleed damage and their attacks go around a blocking shield.

  

  

###  [Undead Laborer](/Undead+Laborer)

  

_Torch Hollow. As if a lifetime of toil wasn't enough, these workers continue their duties even in death. And this time, their job is to kill you. Probably as in life, these under-appreciated, down-trodden souls simply aren't equipped for the task -- they face you unarmed_

  

  

###  [Bonewheel Skeleton](/Bonewheel+Skeleton)

  

Skeletons stuck on wheels. 

  

  

###  Invader - [Merciless Roenna](/Merciless+Roenna)

  

_Roenna wears a helm associated with the warlocks of Aldia. Could the unnatural condition of this forest be related to the experiments of the Aldian mages, or is it mere coincidence?_   
  
Merciless Roenna is one of the members of [Aldia Warlocks](/Aldia+Warlock) and formerly a [Dark Priestess](/Dark+Priestess), she wears [Warlock Mask](/Warlock+Mask) and [Priestess Set](/Priestess+Set), patrols the Huntsman's Copse with her [Bone Scythe](/Bone+Scythe) and [Cursed Bone Shield](/Cursed+Bone+Shield), unlike the other warlocks, she does not cast magic. 

  

  

###  Invader - [Forlorn](/Forlorn)

  

_Born of Aldia's Obsession with the First Sin, the Forlorn lost both their corporeal form and a world to call their own. Now they drift into other worlds, ever in search of a home. But without self, one has neither beginning nor end, and so the Forlorn have only to wander._
