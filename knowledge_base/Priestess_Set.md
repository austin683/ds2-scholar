> Headpiece/Robe/Gloves/Skirt worn by Drangleic clerics.  
>   
> The clerics of Drangleic have retained their status throughout the ages, but were always at arms length from the royal family, as if their existence was little more than a formality.  
>   
> It is customary for clerics to wear different garb depending on their area, but the reason for this practice is unknown...  
>    
>  This is a woman's robe.

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Dark Priestess](/Dark+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Dark Priestess") in [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine"), who is found in a small rotunda above the main path.
  * Dropped by NPC invaders [Merciless Roenna](/Merciless+Roenna "Dark Souls 2 Merciless Roenna") in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman's+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman's Copse") and [Peculiar Kindalur](/Peculiar+Kindalur "Dark Souls 2 Peculiar Kindalur") in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana").
  * [Scholar of the First Sin] Full set is found behind an illusory wall in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"), just before [Prowling Magus and Congregation](/Prowling+Magus+and+Congregation "Dark Souls 2 Prowling Magus and Congregation") boss. On NG+ pieces of the set are also dropped by dark spirit [Dark Priestess](/Dark+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Dark Priestess") found in the same room.
  * [Scholar of the First Sin] Dropped by [Dark Priestess](/Dark+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Dark Priestess") in [Dragon Aerie](/Dragon+Aerie "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Aerie"), who is found on a side path next to second wyvern's nest.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Headpiece grants +1 to Faith.
  * Robe offers second highest lightning defense (almost equal to that of [Archdrake](/Archdrake+Set "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Set") robe, [Lucatiel's](/Lucatiel's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel's Set") vest and [Saint's](/Saint's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Saint's Set") robe).
  * Skirt offers second highest lightning defense (almost equal to that of [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress+Set "Dark Souls 2 Desert Sorceress Set") skirt, [Lucatiel's](/Lucatiel's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel's Set") boots and [White Priest](/White+Priest+Set "Dark Souls 2 White Priest Set") skirt).
  * This set is believed to be the clothing of [Aldia Warlocks](/Aldia+Warlock "Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock") (especially [Merciless Roenna](/Merciless+Roenna "Dark Souls 2 Merciless Roenna")): switch the helm to [Warlock Mask](/Warlock+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Warlock Mask") and the colour scheme fits well.
