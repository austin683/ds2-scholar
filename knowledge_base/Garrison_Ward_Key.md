### Garrison Ward Key Usage in Dark Souls 2

  * Opens the locked gate in [Frozen Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Eleum Loyce"), unlocking access to the [Frigid Outskirts](/Frigid+Outskirts "Dark Souls 2 Frigid Outskirts") and the [Expulsion Chamber](/Bonfires "Dark Souls 2 Bonfires") bonfire.
  * To find the gate, start at the Abandoned Dwelling bonfire. Work your way forward up the snow banks to the walls with Rampart Golems. Fight through them until you reach the bridge with the Crystal Golem. After the bridge, turn left and you will see three Hollows crouched down, a Rampart Golem with a lance, and a door behind them (that is otherwise a dead end). That's the door to the Expulsion Chamber.

### DKS2 Garrison Ward Key Location

  * The player must defeat [Aava, the King's Pet](/Aava%2C+the+King%27s+Pet "Dark Souls 2 Aava%2C the King%27s Pet"), and speak to [Alsanna, Silent Oracle](/Alsanna%2C+Silent+Oracle "Dark Souls 2 Alsanna%2C Silent Oracle") (to calm the winds blowing through Frozen Eleum Loyce) before heading to the [Outer Wall](/Outer+Wall "Dark Souls 2 Outer Wall") bonfire.
  * From the [Outer Wall](/Outer+Wall "Dark Souls 2 Outer Wall") bonfire, make sure you light a torch or have Flame Butterflies. Go through the main gates, then turn right. Follow the path around to a small room, down the stairs, across a short bridge, and down stairs that curve to the right. Keep going straight, then take the right between some buildings and up a slight snow bank to a courtyard with several Crystal Golems around a frozen fountain. Pass under the arch on the far side, then go around the snow bank and take a hard left up a small flight of stairs. At the top, double back and go through the doorway to the right. Go up the stairs, then around/through a room full of boxes and enemies to the door on the far side. Go straight, up a small flight of stairs, then keep going straight ahead to the right of a tall snow bank and go behind it. The calmed snowstorm has revealed a curving, narrow passage through the snow bank. At the end, use your Torch (or Flame Butterfly) to light all four sconces. A door will open revealing two [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry")'s and other enemies that guard the corpse holding this key.
