Players need to hit enemies perfectly with the blade at its highest speed to deal full damage, otherwise, they will deal only half or even a third of its damage. This weapon requires players to familiarize themselves with its moveset to use it effectively.

> A great scythe used to harvest grain.   
>   
>  Normally used as a farm tool, not a weapon. It feels almost as if there were powers in its giant blade, perhaps drawn from the fears of those hunted by this fearsome thing. 

### How to get Great Scythe in Dark Souls 2

  * Acquired from [Titchy Gren](/Gren "Dark Souls 2 Gren") in [Undead Purgatory](/Undead+Purgatory "Dark Souls 2 Undead Purgatory"); note you must have a token of spite in your inventory before interacting with him.
  * Rare Tseldora Spider drop.

### DS2 Great Scythe Hints and Tips

  * This weapon heavily relies on direct hits to deal full damage. It requires hiting enemies perfectly with the blade and when it is at its highest speed, otherwise you will deal only half or even a third of its damage. This is especially hard with the Great Scythes regular attack both one and two handed as your character will be stabbing towards the ground giving it a limited hitbox for the point of the blade, the follow up attack is very easy to perfectly hit, however it does have shorter reach than the first two-handed r1. The strong one handed attack will slightly pull your enemy towards you but despite the look, does not surpass shields and is also difficult to directly hit for full damage.
  * For these reasons this weapon is not something everyone can just pick up and use efficiently, but rather requires players to familiarize themselves with its moveset to hit for full damage as opposed to a third of the damage due to indirect hits.
  * Requires regular titanite to upgrade.
  * Does not cause bleeding like in Dark Souls(1).
