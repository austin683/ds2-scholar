### Upgraded Rings in Dark Souls 2

In Dark Souls II, rings can be found in different locations, acquired as rewards for defeating bosses, or obtained through various in-game activities. Some DS2 Rings have unique effects, while others may have upgraded versions, indicated by a +1, +2, or +3 suffix.

While rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, they cannot be upgraded. Upgraded versions must be obtained at various points in the game, including from corpses, chests, and defeating [Bosses](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses")

An important restriction is that a character cannot equip two rings of the same kind, regardless of their upgrade level.
