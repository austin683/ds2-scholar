**Lion Mage Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

  
  
  
_"Robe/cuffs/skirt worn by Lion Clan mages."_   
_"The Lion Clan are an offshoot race that appear in historical records quite abruptly, as if one day they climbed out of the depths of the very earth itself."_

###  Set Location

  * Found in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"), around Shaded Ruins bonfire, in a chest past a petrified [Lion Warrior](/Lion+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Warrior") (SotFS: and guarded by a [Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") (there's another chest with only petrified Lion Warrior next to it)). 
    * Note: The chest also contains a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore"), so a branch is not lost in collecting this armor.
    * Still at this location in the Scholar Of The First Sin edition.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Cuffs offer second highest magic and lightning defense (both almost equal to that of [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress+Set "Dark Souls 2 Desert Sorceress Set") gloves), and second highest dark defense (equal to that of [Black Witch](/Black+Witch+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch Set") gloves and [Bone King](/Bone+King+Set "Dark Souls 2 Bone King Set") cuffs).
  * Oddly, no Lion Mages appear in the game.
  * This armor set can actually be collected without using a Fragrant Branch by using an exploit in the way the game processes jumping at 30fps, by jumping over the broken wall behind the chest with a low enough equip load. (Does not work in SOTFS version unless fps is lowered to 30) This will leave you trapped behind the petrified Lion, so a Homeward Bone will be required to escape without using the Fragrant Branch.
  * Set increases cast speed. 
    * Each piece of the set increases cast speed by 5.2% rounded DOWN to the nearest whole value.
    * Effects are compounded by [Clear Bluestone Ring](/Clear+Bluestone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Clear Bluestone Ring") (more testing required).
    * Effects are compounded by wearing multiple pieces of the set.
