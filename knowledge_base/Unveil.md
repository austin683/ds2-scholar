**Unveil** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle.

> "A miracle that senses traitors.  
> Reveals the location of the nearest enemy, or invading dark spirit.  
>   
> Those who serve the Lindelt Monastery willfully adhere to strict commandments. This miracle was created to castigate those who ignore the righteous teachings."

### Acquired From

  * Buy from Straid for 2200 souls.

### Notes

  * After the release of the Sunken King DLC, this no longer locates players.  
Very strategic miracle as it allows you to plan your next move or attempt a swift assault.  
Useful for knowing if host mobs are hostile towards you if they used a certain sorcery to make them hostile towards you.  
  

  * **NOTE:** Using Unveil in the Shaded Woods near the invisible enemies will occasionally lead you to Vengarl's Head NPC. Cast again if this happens.
