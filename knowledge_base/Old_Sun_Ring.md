**Old Sun Ring** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). The **Old Sun Ring** , a peculiar stone ring resonating with fiery heat, gathers power when the wearer endures harm, subsequently erupting to harm nearby foes while leaving the wearer unharmed. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

### Dark Souls 2 Old Sun Ring Effects

**Durability** : 75

**Weight** :

  * 3.0

**Effect:**

  * Explodes after taking damage, following a brief audio cue. Explosion AOE is centered around the wearer. 
    * Deals close to 300 damage to targets with low defense.
    * Has a 10-30% of causing an explosion once it reaches the damage threshold. The probability degrades rapidly as the durability decreases.
    * Each explosion lowers the durability by 10, not including the damage done to activate.
    * Will explode multiple times before actually breaking. Multiple activations can stack through receiving repeated instances of durability loss, such as the fire pits in the rotten boss room.

  * [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"): From the Ruined Fork Road bonfire, enter the fogged forest, hug the right wall until you reach the chest containing the ring. Be wary of the Shades guarding it.
