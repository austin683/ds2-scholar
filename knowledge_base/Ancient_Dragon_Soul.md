### Ancient Dragon Soul Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * It's likely that this soul was supposed to be dropped by the [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon") as it describes the NPC who "stands magnificently, deep within the shrine." It may have been moved into the memory due to the difficulty of the boss battle or some other development reason. Alternatively, there are many theories supported by in-game evidence that the Ancient Dragon NPC is an imposter or a fake, implying that the NPC does not possess a legitimate Ancient Dragon Soul, which is why it is obtained elsewhere.
  * The fact that this soul was "created" is in fact in par with the lore of [Aldia, scholar of the First Sin](/Aldia,+scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Aldia, scholar of the First Sin"), and what we can guess of his experimentation. The reason that this soul is not dropped by the Ancient dragon is most likely due to problems during the developement of the game. We have the [Soldier's Rest](/Soldier's+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Soldier's Rest") area, with a bonfire, but with nothing of importance in it, except a "Giant Tree", with no memory attached to it. It is very likely that we should have had another memory there, with the fifth giant soul. That didn't happen, most likely due to time constraint. So the dev's decided to make the Ancient Dragon boss drop the giant soul, and move his soul to another memory. From a developement perpespective, that memory is easy to create, as it his purely static with a lot of re-used assets. This is pure speculation of course, but it explain the lack of interest in Soldier's rest.
  * This soul will NOT be respawned by using an ascetic on the bonfire.

### DKS2 Origins of the Ancient Dragon:

This dragon bears the most resemblance to the dragons in the opening cutscene of Dark Souls 1, which combined with the destroyed archtrees and the overall grey setting, suggests that it was killed in battle by the army of Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight in the "Age of Ancients." It is unlikely to be Seath or the Everlasting Dragon from Dark Souls 1, due to the difference in appearance between them. It is highly likely that the Ancient Dragon was formed by Aldia from the likeness of this dragon, and that the two would have looked almost exactly the same, with similar powers and strength.   
  
However, the Duke's Dear Freja does drop the soul of Seath, suggesting that the Duke himself was somehow influenced by Seath's soul which was channeled by the body of this dead dragon underneath Brightstone Cove Tseldora. There is a possibility that this dragon could have been one of those killed by Seath himself. Ultimately he seems to have used this power to create Freja.
