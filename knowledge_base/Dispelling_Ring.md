**Dispelling Ring** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). The **Dispelling Ring** , adorned with gemstones of four distinct colors, boosts the wearer's resistance to magic, lightning, fire, and dark. The craftsmanship needed to harmonize the diverse powers of four stones into a single ring is nothing short of transcendent. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> A protective ring set with gemstones of four different colors. Increases the wearer's resistance to magic, lightning, fire and dark. The artistry required to attune the varying powers of four different stones within one ring could only be described as transcendental. There is only one sorcerer who could have done this; a man from the lost land of Olaphis.
