_"Armor of a knight subsumed by dark._  
_No one knows the true identity of these men who are said to freely manipulate dark. Old foreign legends describe them as poor souls who chased the lost art of life drain."_

### Location

  * Obtaining the full set requires getting the [King's Ring](/King%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Ring") and progressing to [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep").
  * The Armor can be obtained in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"). Travel to the second bonfire, proceed to cross the platform above the lava (where the guy normally smashes the bridge) and enter the room filled with falling platforms. Pull the lever to lower the platform into the lava, then follow up the stairs and along the platforms to the ladder. Climb up, and a ** _mimic_** will be directly to your right. Also, if you continue to go up, the [Black Knight Greataxe](/Black+Knight+Greataxe "Dark Souls 2 Black Knight Greataxe") can be found.
  * Scholar of the First Sin: The mimic has been moved to [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"). From the first Bonfire in The Gutter move straight ahead over the first wooden bridge. Mind the hole on the first platform and move past it, over another wooden bridge. After crossing the bridge go right up some ramps and follow it to the top (should be two or three ramps). Look to the right as you come to the top and jump down to a platform filled with oil pools and some hollows.

Dispatch the hollows and either avoid the oil pools or kill the Dark Suckers that spawn out of them. Look straight ahead to the cave wall and follow it (should be towards the left from where you dropped down.) Follow the wall and drop down to a new section of the cave that houses a small tower. Dispatch the hollows around the tower and locate the ladder on the side of the tower and climb to the top. Once at the top, jump over to an iron chest on a cave ledge. Turn around to face the tower again and you will see a hole/door in the side of it, run towards it (don’t jump) and you will fall into it.

Inside is the mimic containing the Dark Armor chest piece. Killing this mimic may cause the item to drop a single floor down and not all the way down. If this happens you will need to role into the second floor from the hole in the floor the mimic is located on. Because of this it is advised to use a Lloyd’s Talisman to put the mimic to sleep and grab the loot that way.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Dark Set](/Dark+Set "Dark Souls 2 Dark Set").
  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
