**Status Effects** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are those which are detrimental to players and [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs"). There are several **Status Effects** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki") **which can affect the character, and every character has a specific amount of resistance or invulnerability which can lessen the effects. The following is a list of the status effects in the game, with an explanation of the effect and relevant items.

Having 900 to a status resistance, will make you invulnerable to it.

Don't waste level to increase these resistance, armors, common fruit and rings do a much better job. The same goes for the status Attack Bonus, having 50 or 200 points to them will trigger the bleed or poison with the same amount of hits, maybe 1 less. Just focus on leveling the weapon.

## All Status Effects in Dark Souls 2

###  [Bleed](/Bleed "Dark Souls 2 Bleed")

  * Bleed causes one's maximum stamina to be severely reduced to around 75% for 5-10 seconds. It also causes around 200 damage.
  * Being bled will also cause slower movement speed, agility and roll recovery. It is advised to avoid combat during this state as enemies are able to exploit your lowered stamina and speed.
  * It can be applied to one's weapon with [Bleeding Serum](/Bleeding+Serum "Dark Souls 2 Bleeding Serum"). [Red Leech Troches](/Red+Leech+Troches "Dark Souls 2 Red Leech Troches") can be used to temporarily increase Bleed resistance. Use of a [Bleed Stone](/Bleed+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Bleed Stone") can make a weapon permanently cause a bleed effect to enemies.
  * Several weapons have innate Bleeding effects, such as the [Morning Star](/Morning+Star "Dark Souls 2 Morning Star") and [Flamberge](/Flamberge "Dark Souls 2 Flamberge").

  * Several enemies can inflict Bleed, most notably [Dark Stalkers](/Bloathead "Dark Souls 2 Bloathead") in [No-Man's Wharf](/No-man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man%27s Wharf") and [Stray Hounds](/Stray+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Stray Hound").
  * Bleed can be built up through 100% physical resistance shields, and is a method to punish users who don't lower their shield.

###  [Poison](/Poison "Dark Souls 2 Poison")

  * Poison acts the same way, no matter how it is applied (melee, arrow or spell), inflicting about 1050-1095 HP damage on NPC, enemies, bosses and you, the max values change according to your game fps.
  * Poison causes one's HP to drain rapidly, at a rate of 15 HP every around 0,28 second (about the same rate a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") restores health, 10HP).
  * Poison and Poison buildup can be removed by eating [Poison Moss](/Poison+Moss "Dark Souls 2 Poison Moss"), using a [Monastery Charm](/Monastery+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Charm"), [Dragon Charm](/Dragon+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Charm"), [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing") and [Caressing Prayer](/Caressing+Prayer "Dark Souls 2 Caressing Prayer"). Poison resistance can be temporarily increased by eating a [Common Fruit](/Common+Fruit "Dark Souls 2 Common Fruit").
  * Use of a [Poison Stone](/Poison+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Poison Stone") can make a weapon permanently cause a poison effect to enemies.
  * Some weapons and spells have innate poison effects, including the [Poison Mist](/Poison+Mist "Dark Souls 2 Poison Mist") Pyromancy and [Black Scorpion Stinger](/Black+Scorpion+Stinger "Dark Souls 2 Black Scorpion Stinger").
  * Many enemies can inflict Poison buildup, including [Dog Rats](/Dog+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Dog Rat") and Pyromancer Giants.
  * Traps using Poison abound. Beware of jars filled with toxins and small lakes of poison in the [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") and the statues that spit toxic gel in [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch").

###  Toxic

  * Toxic is an alternative type of poison. Toxin inflicts the same amount of damage to players, but over a shorter time period, thereby causing damage faster.
  * Toxic Mist Pyromancy inflicts Toxin, which on NPC's drains 15 HP every ca 0.21 seconds, totaling 1365-1485 damage, the max value depend on your game fps.
  * Being afflicted with Toxin makes the same sound effect as poison, although a much darker poison cloud will follow you and the otherwise green poison drop icon will be purple.

  * Both Toxic and Poison can be built up at the same time on the player, allowing for them to be afflicted by both at the same time but also both are resisted with poison resistance.

###  [Petrification](/Petrification "Dark Souls 2 Petrification")

  * Petrification causes one to turn to stone, instantly killing them. If the player is killed via petrification, the resulting Hollowing is far worse than if the player had simply died through damage or falling, taking around 30% of the players' health upon death rather than 10%.
  * Some NPCs are petrified initially, but can be cured later.
  * A [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") can be used to cure petrified NPCs, which is required to access the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"). [Rosabeth of Melfia](/Rosabeth+of+Melfia "Dark Souls 2 Rosabeth of Melfia") is blocking the entrance to the woods, and once cured, will move to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") as a pyromancy trainer.
  * See the [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") page for a list of things that can be unpetrified.
  * Enemies that can cause Petrification include [Basilisks](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") and Stone Rats.

###  [Curse](/Curse "Dark Souls 2 Curse")

  * Being cursed lowers one's health equal to the amount of one death, as well as turning them hollow. The effects of being cursed stop once one's maximum health is reduced to half (like being fully hollow). It bypasses the [Ring of Life Protection](/Ring+of+Life+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Life Protection"), but not the [Ring of Binding](/Ring+of+Binding "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Binding").
  * Curse cannot be cured. Once its buildup is complete, it takes effect immediately and the buildup gauge is reset.
  * Curse buildup can be cancelled through spells and items, such as [Divine Blessings](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing"). The [Ring of Resistance](/Ring+of+Resistance "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Resistance") and [Cursebite Ring](/Cursebite+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Cursebite Ring") can slow its buildup significantly.
  * The effects of curse can be reversed by using a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy").
  * Many enemies and traps cause Curse buildup. [Lion Clan Warriors](/Lion+Clan+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Clan Warrior") are the most infamous enemy that causes Curse, and the [Cursed Vessel](/Cursed+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Cursed Vessel") trap causes significant Curse buildup.
  * Note that as a summoned phantom, sources of curse buildup such as Cursed Vessels will constantly damage you rather than hollowing you.
  * Even though Curse will turn you hollow, any summoned phantoms will stay in your world, rather than be kicked.
  * If the player wears one of the four available crowns ([King's Crown](/King%27s+Crown "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Crown"), [Crown of the Sunken King](/Crown+of+the+Sunken+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Sunken King Helm"), [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King+helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King helm"), [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King+helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King helm")) after recieving [Vendrick's Blessing](/Vendrick%27s+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick%27s Blessing"), all curse buildup is prevented.
  * The [Hollow Skin](/Hollow+Skin "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Skin") helmet found in the Iron Crown DLC gives full immunity to curse.
  * If the player becomes hollow this way, will not count as a death (you can still get [Illusory Ring of a Conqueror](/Illusory+Ring+of+a+Conqueror "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of a Conqueror")).
