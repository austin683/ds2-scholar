**Claws** is one of the available [Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. The Claws in Dark Souls 2 offer a unique playstyle as a hand-attached weapon. With a distinct three-pronged design, wearers engage foes in a scratching motion that inflicts deep wounds and causes bleeding. The weapon inherently induces bleed, and players can enhance this effect by infusing it with bleed and consistently striking with power stance light attacks.

> A weapon that attaches to the hands.
