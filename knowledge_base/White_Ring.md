### DS2 White Ring Tips and Notes

  * Invaders tend to prioritize the host, and use of this ring as the host will allow you to blend in with your summoned phantom(s), countering that tendency, however, invader can still view the name of the host upon invading his world, and the name of both the host and phantom are displayed, this can be used as a counter measure.
  * Can be used to disguise as a phantom while invading.
  * Can be used to pretend to be an invader when hosting for the [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant"), allowing for you to trick invaders into trusting you before betraying them.
  * Does not change the colour of the Red Soapstone Sign.
