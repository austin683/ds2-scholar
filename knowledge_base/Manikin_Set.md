**Manikin Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
  
_"Mask of the Manikins of Harvest Valley. A fickle queen gave them life, and tore off their faces. How else could she forgive those who dared gaze upon her?"_   
_Top/Gloves/Boots: "[Armor piece] of the manikins of Harvest Valley._   
_The peculiar art of puppetry is vestige of the two lost lands. A queen breathed life into these dolls with the very miasma that afflicted her poison-drenched bosom, so that she would have slaves to serve her temperamental will."_   

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Manikins](/Masked+Manikin "Manikins") in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak), except for mask.
  * Mask is found just above Central Earthen Peak bonfire, next to jars filled with poison.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Titanite").
  * Mask offers second highest bleed resistance (equal to that of [Heide Knight Iron Mask](/Heide+Knight+Iron+Mask)).
  * Boots offer third highest bleed resistance (almost equal to that of [Monastery](/Monastery+Set) boots).
  * All pieces of the set hold third or fourth place in physical defense to weight ratio (40 def per 1 unit of weight), which makes this set the best choice of lightweight armor.
  * From Software had to change the mask design due to legal issues with Naruto anime/manga, which is probably also why manikins met in-game are headless. Maybe Fromsoft had no time or desire to redesign their heads with new mask. Also, the abomination this mask is now could be the result of the original artist getting too offended by copyright problem. (Source needed.)
  * A mod is available that changes mask's looks to how it was in the trailer (as any texture mod, it requires and is only compatible with DX9 version of the game). 
    * Download from .
