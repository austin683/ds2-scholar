### Dark Souls 2 Old Knight Information

_"Old Knights are giant sentinels from an ancient time, when the Heide Kingdom reigned. They are reminiscent of the brass giants from Dark Souls I  
Old Knights have fairly high HP, damage output, and staggering attacks, but slow movement and attack speed  
Old Knights may use ultra greatswords, swords and shields, or great hammers. They all have telegraphed and relatively slow swing speeds  
Old Knights cannot be staggered, backstabbed, or parried. But they are fairly easy to circle strafe, and their attacks are easy to roll through  
Old Knights are weak against magic and strike (i.e. mace) type attacks_ _"_

### Old Knight Strategy Tips in DKS2

  * Circle around them as they attack; try to get behind them if you can. Wait until the knight has done his three strikes before attacking. Try to avoid fighting them near the edges, as their attacks have very strong knockback
  * Weapons with strike attacks recommended. The Mace (buy in Majula from the blacksmith for 1200 souls) works very well (no elemental infusion recommended). Usually they die after 3-4 hits from a mace, so evade all attacks and spam R1 and they should be dead. (Confirmed)
  * A shield with 100 physical damage reduction is very helpful in these fights, in combination with the circling technique mentioned above. Keep your shield up as you circle/strafe during their attacks, then drop it to recover stamina as you rush in to attack. Make sure you have enough stamina to roll away after you attack. Rinse, repeat.
  * Circle them to the right (Shield) while it prepares its first strike. Keep being on his shield side until the second strike is done then change to his sword side. You can attack if you are on his sword side. Be carfull of going to sword side to early since he can change direction and hit you.

*For those who lack the skill to successfully dodge their attacks, try leading them behind you until they stop. Immediately run up to them, dodge their first set of attacks, then hit them once. Assuming you did it correctly, they will not attack afterwards, and begin backing up again. Repeat until they are dead.   
*Another method is to lead them to a staircase and keep them there. Stand lower than them whenever possible, as it makes dodging attacks much easier. Standing higher does the same, but requires you to run slightly farther, and makes it much less likely that your own attacks will hit.
