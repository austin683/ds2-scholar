### Full Dragon's Sanctum Walkthrough

### Do you believe in Ghosts?

Once you've enter **Dragon's Sanctum** , you'll find a locked door on your left, and a corridor in front of you. The door can only be accessed via a key you pick up later, so for now go down the corridor to find a switch on the left side, hit it and pick up a [Soul of a Great Hero](/Soul+of+a+Great+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Great Hero") and 3x [Dragon Charm](/Dragon+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Charm"), from the body.

Head into the illuminated room on the right, there are two [Sanctum Knights](/Sanctum+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight") and two statues, emanating a red aura on altars. Those are immune to any physical damage while they are in their spirit form (which makes them look like phantoms). They can still be damaged with elemental attacks (although recive less damage while in their spirit form), or turned back into a physical form by breaking the statues on the altars. Kill them then loot the chests for a total of:

  * 5x [Old Growth Balm](/Old+Growth+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Old Growth Balm")
  * 1x [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab")
  * 1x [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel")
  * 50x [Destructive Greatarrow](/Destructive+Greatarrow "Dark Souls 2 Destructive Greatarrow")
  * 1x [Catarina Helm](/Catarina+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Catarina Helm")

Exit to the hallway and continue going forward to the next division, past the stairs. A [Sanctum Soldier](/Sanctum+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier") will attack from the left, and there is another one on the right. The raised floor tile triggers a crossbow trap which can be used to kill them. Two more [Soldiers](/Sanctum+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier") lie on the floor and rise as you approach. At the end there is a poison-trapped chest containing 3x [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root"). Look at the ceiling and shoot an arrow at the switch to raise a wall panel here, revealing a chest that contains 5x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") and 3x [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). 

On the left of the hallway, you may notice the multiple doors leading to the next room, containing another [Sanctum Soldiers](/Sanctum+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier") and a [Sanctum Priestess](/Sanctum+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Priestess"). Deal with them then pick up a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Before stepping onto the pressure plate, take out the [Sanctum Archer](/Sanctum+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier") on the upper platform. Stepping on the pressure plate will rotate the contraption by 90 degrees, so activate it 3 times to be able to go through.

Keep going forward until you reach a junction. To the left there is a body with a [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder"), while on the right you'll find a wall that will be a shortcut later. Continue forward and jump over the hole. You will soon come to a small window and closed door, on your left. Shoot an arrow at the switch, visible from the window, to open the passage on the left. However before you enter, go down the end of the hall and shoot the switch, above on the wall ahead, which will open a hidden area in the room at the end of the passage we just opened.

### Plunder

Head back and through the door. Kill the [Sanctum Soldier](/Sanctum+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier") on your left, and notice the stairs on the right. Before going down the stairs, notice the standout tile on the floor; this triggers the staircase ahead to be engulfed in spikes, which you can use to kill the 2 [Soldiers](/Sanctum+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier") there. Loot the two bodies as well for a [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero") and a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Open the three chests at the end for a total of:

  * 3x [Boltstone](/Boltstone "Dark Souls 2 Boltstone")
  * x3 [Bleedstone](/Bleed+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Bleed Stone")
  * 3x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")
  * x3 [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone")
  * 1x [Puzzling Stone Sword](/Puzzling+Stone+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Puzzling Stone Sword").

### Egg Den & Spiky Floors

Backtrack out of the room, and back out to the corridor where you jumped over the hole in the stairs, and fall through it. You'll find be a [Corrosive Egg Crawler](/Corrosive+Egg+Crawlers "Dark Souls 2 Corrosive Egg Crawlers") on the right, kill it and equip the [Cat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") or any gear that lowers fall damage as you're in for a bumpy ride. Fall through the hole to land in the middle of an [Egg Crawler](/Corrosive+Egg+Crawlers "Dark Souls 2 Corrosive Egg Crawlers") den; the best way to deal with them is to quickly run up the stairs and make full use of spells. After you kill them all you can loot the bodies in the area for a total of:

  * 10x [Dung Pie](/Dung+Pie "Dark Souls 2 Dung Pie")
  * 5x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem")
  * 1x [Old Growth Balm](/Old+Growth+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Old Growth Balm")
  * 20x [Poison Throwing Knife](/Poison+Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Poison Throwing Knife") (on the stairs)

Head up the ladder at the top of the stairs, and open the metal chest that contains the [Flynn's Ring](/Flynn%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flynn%27s Ring"). Head out the exit to drop back down to where the body with the repair powder was. Once again, go down the stairs and drop in the hole but this time, head left to find a room with the floor covered in spikes.

There is a [Sanctum Knight](/Sanctum+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight") around the corner after the bridge and a [Sanctum Priestess](/Sanctum+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Priestess") above. It is advised to take care of the [Sanctum Priestess](/Sanctum+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Priestess") with ranged attacks before triggering the [Sanctum Knight](/Sanctum+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight"), if you prefer to stay with melee approaches, we will soon be able to go up to her. The [Sanctum Knight](/Sanctum+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight") is immune to the spikes while he is in his spectral form, so lure him back to the stairs and take him out with elemental attacks. The corpse on the spikes contains, but we are ignoring that for now, and instead go forward on the safe path on the right side of the spikes.

Going through the doorframes on the right, we find another room covered in spikes, another [Sanctum Knight](/Sanctum+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight"), several bodies with items, another rotating contraption and a ladder. Hitting the siwth on the middle doorframe will also open a hidden area with a chest in it. For now, we ignore all the loot and instead go through to third doorway, to reach the ladder without having to take a step through the spikes, up on the ladder, we are now on the pathway above the doorway, near the end of it on the ceiling, there is the switch that finally takes care of the spikes. We can now loot the corpses, the one from the little spike are from before, under the bridge, contains 3x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"), the corpses in the area with the contraption contain 3x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"), 5x [Holy Water Urn](/Holy+Water+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Holy Water Urn") and 1x [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). The chest in the same are contains 1x [Dragon Stone](/Dragon+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Stone"), which we will need later to reach [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon%27s+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Sanctum").

After looting the area, head back up the ladder and go into the room at the end of the pathway, where another [Sanctum Knight](/Sanctum+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight") and another [Sanctum Priestess](/Sanctum+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Priestess") are waiting for us. Lure the Knight outside and down to the now spike-less area to make the fight a bit easier, then go back up and take care of the Priestess. In the room there is a poison trapped chest with 5x [Lloyd's Talisman](/Lloyd's+Talisman "Dark Souls 2 Lloyd's Talisman") and a switch next to it. Activating it will open the door on the staircase to the left, which acts as a shortcut back to the staircase right before the dropdown. The doorway to the right leads to the path abouve the first spike area, on the left of it before the doorway, there is a chest containing a [Bloodbite Ring +1](/Bloodbite+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bloodbite Ring"). Since we cant go back up from her again, drop down and, before we go back up, go past the doorframes and down the stairs. Be carefull of another [Sanctum Knight](/Sanctum+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight") around the corner; once you have dealt with him, stand at the bottom end of the stairs and turn back. There is a switch on the wall up high, hit it with an arrow to activate it. This will open up the closed door we have seen right after climbing up the ladder, so head back to the doorframes and up the ladder, then jump over the gap. In the now opened room lies the**[Hidden Sanctum Chamber](/Hidden+Sanctum+Chamber "Dark Souls 2 Hidden Sanctum Chamber") bonfire, **going through the other exit of the room, we will reach a corpse containing the [Sanctum Crossbow](/Sanctum+Crossbow "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Crossbow").

### From the First Bonfire to the Key

After reaching that checkpoint, head back to where we dropped down for the chest with the Bloodbite Ring +1, but this time, go through the doorframe and head down stairs. We will enter a room with 3 [Sanctum Knights](/Sanctum+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight"). Destroy all the "statues" in the walls in this room to make all the [Sanctum Knights](/Sanctum+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight") in the Sanctum visible and weaker. Kill them and pick up the [Eternal Sanctum Key](/Eternal+Sanctum+Key "Dark Souls 2 Eternal Sanctum Key") and a [Sanctum Knight Helm](/Sanctum+Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight Set").

### Path to the Second Bonfire

Go back to the bridge where the [Priestess](/Sanctum+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Priestess") stood. Walk till the middle of the walkway and on the left there will a rotating stone with a large and a small hole, like the one you found earlier. Shoot an arrow to the switch on the floor on the other side of the contraption. Drop down and get closer to the small hole, shoot another arrow to the switch. Go back up the ladder and to the end of the walkway, shoot a final arrow to the switch. Drop down and enter that room, inside there will be a chest that contains the [Denial](/Denial "Dark Souls 2 Denial") miracle.

Head back to the room that had spikes on the floor but this time, head down the narrow steps on the left side. Kill the [Sanctum Knight](/Sanctum+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight") and continue right, down the stairs and into the corridor on the right. Go through the doorway on the right and down the stairs, once again. Pick up the [Old Growth Balm](/Old+Growth+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Old Growth Balm") here before proceeding down the two subsequent sets of stairs to trigger the [Jester Thomas ](/Jester+Thomas "Dark Souls 2 Jester Thomas")invasion -strong pyromancer, should consider fire resistance before encounter.

After dealing with the invader, proceed through the Fog Gate and emerge into shallow waters holding four of [The Imperfects](/the+Imperfect "Dark Souls 2 the Imperfect"). Be carefull when fighting them, as they can charge, spit orbs and eat you, but they are a good source for [Petrified Dragon Bones](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") and [Titanite Slabs](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab"). Especially since there is the **[Lair of the Imperfect](/Lair+of+the+Imperfect "Dark Souls 2 Lair of the Imperfect") bonfire **in this area, at the other side of the shallow waters. The easiest way to reach it is to follow the walls of stalgtites on the right; there is also corpse with 3x [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") in that way. When facing the pyramide, head to the row of stalagtites to your right, on the other sind, there is a corpse with 1x [Soul of a Great Hero](/Soul+of+a+Great+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Great Hero"). From the bonfire, if you go towards the middle of the pyramide (where the entrence to this area was) you will eventually hit a wall of stalgmites and a corpse with 3x [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Following the wall to the right, you will find a corpse with 2x [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root"), and a path out of the water on the right of you. You also reach that area if you cycle around the shallow water are following the very outer walls of stone and stalagtites counter-clockwise.

### Dragon's Rest

When you get out of the water you will see some stairs leading to a circular stone. Use the [Dragon Stone](/Dragon+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Stone") here to create a path that will lead to [Dragon's Rest](/Dragon%27s+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Rest"). Enter the next building and you will see an obelisk and a cave entrance. Hit the obelisk to enable the elevator and go through the cave to find a body that has the [Drakeblood Greatsword](/Drakeblood+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Drakeblood Greatsword"). Head back to the elevator and take it up on the next level to find another elevator and an exit.

The elevator will take you the first bonfire of [Shulva - Sanctum City](/Shulva+-+Sanctum+City "Dark Souls 2 Shulva - Sanctum City"), the exit will take up a set of stairs. Before the stairs to your left is a corpse containing a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Go up the stairs and you will reach the entrance to [Dragon's Rest](/Dragon%27s+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Rest") (the location message saying Dragon's Rest will only show when you reach the bottom, near the Boss fog gate, so consider the whole next walkthrough to be Dragon's Rest area).

### Eternal Sanctum Key

With the[ Key](/Eternal+Sanctum+Key "Dark Souls 2 Eternal Sanctum Key") you can now open the door at the start of the Sanctum. Inside are 2 Priestesses along with 5 chests containing: [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root") x5, [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root") x2, [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root") x1, [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") x2 and [Lightning Clutch Ring](/Lightning+Clutch+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Lightning Clutch Ring"). Climb up two sets of ladders to encounter 3 Egg Crawlers. Climb the next ladder to obtain the [Sanctum Shield](/Sanctum+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Shield"). On the outside balcony you can light 2 Sconces. Drop down back to the level below and cross the long bridge ([Rockshield Baldyr](/Rockshield+Baldyr "Dark Souls 2 Rockshield Baldyr") will invade you on this bridge).

On the other side of the bridge is the [Priestess' Chamber](/Priestess%27+Chamber "Dark Souls 2 Priestess%27 Chamber") bonfire. Hit the obelisk here to activate the elevator, it will bring you down to the building near the first entrance to [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon's+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon's Sanctum") (where [Sinh](/Sinh,+the+Slumbering+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon") bombarded the bridge). However, on your halfway down you can jump off the elevator. On this level locate a corpse with 5x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). Further around you'll find a chest with the hex [Dark Greatsword](/Dark+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Dark Greatsword"). From here drop down to the bridge below ([Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") is advised) and take the elevator back to Priestess' Chamber bonfire. Proceed forward to the cave and then through the Fog Gate to [Cave of the Dead](/Cave+of+the+Dead "Dark Souls 2 Cave of the Dead").

### Full Dragon's Sanctum Walkthrough

A full walkthrough including all the items, enemies and bosses goes here. You can add links, images. and other details.   
  

Once you enter Dragon's Sanctum you have a closed door on your left, and a corridor in front of you. You need a key you will find later to go through that door, so for now, go down the corridor and you will see a switch on the left side, hit it and pick up a [Soul of a Great Hero](/Soul+of+a+Great+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Great Hero") and 3x [Dragon Charm](/Dragon+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Charm") from the body.   
  
Go towards the illuminated room on the right, there are two Ghost Sanctum Knights and two bodies on altars. Attack the bodies on the altars, or hit them with arrows from the doorway, so the Knights turn visible and will take more damage. Kill the Knights and loot the chests for 5x [Old Growth Balm](/Old+Growth+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Old Growth Balm"), 1x [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab"), 1x [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel"), 50x [Destructive Greatarrow](/Destructive+Greatarrow "Dark Souls 2 Destructive Greatarrow") and one [Catarina Helm](/Catarina+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Catarina Helm").   
  
Exit to the hallway and continue going forward to the next division. A Sanctum Soldier will attack from the left, and there is another one on the right. The raised floor tile triggers a crossbow trap which can be used to kill the Sanctum Soldiers. Two more soldiers are on the floor and rise when you approach. At the end there is a chest (trap chest) with a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). Look at the ceiling and shoot an arrow to the switch, a wall panel will lift revealing a chest that contains 5x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") and 3x [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone").   
  
Kill the Sanctum Priestess and the Sanctum Soldier in the room on the left, pick up a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") and use the pressure plate to rotate the contraption until you can get through (careful with the Sanctum Soldier waiting). Keep going forward until you reach a junction. To the left there is a body with 1x [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder"), to the right there is a wall that will be a shortcut later. Keep going down and jump over the hole. You will reach a closed door. Shoot an arrow into the switch in the hole on the left to open a passage on the left, but before you enter, go down the end of the hall and shoot an arrow on the switch above.   
  
Kill the Sanctum Soldier on your left and before going down the stairs pay attention to the spike trap. Kill the 2 enemies there and loot the 2 bodies for a [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero") and a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy").

Go back to the hole in the stairs you jumped over before, and fall through it. There will be a Corrosive Egg Bug on the right, kill it and equip the [Cat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") or any gear that lowers fall damage. Fall through the hole and you will be surrounded by Egg Crawlers. The best way to deal with them is to quickly run up the stairs and deal use spells or deal with them in small groups. After you kill them all you can loot the bodies in the area for 10x [Dung Pie](/Dung+Pie "Dark Souls 2 Dung Pie"), 20x [Poison Throwing Knife](/Poison+Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Poison Throwing Knife"), 5x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") and a [Old Growth Balm](/Old+Growth+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Old Growth Balm"). Go up the ladder on top of the stairs and open the metal chest that contains the [Flynn's Ring](/Flynn%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flynn%27s Ring"). Go through the exit, you will drop where the body that had a Repair Powder is.   
  
Again go down the stairs and drop in the hole but this time go left and you will find a room with the floor covered in spikes. There are 2 Ghost Sanctum Knights there and a Sanctum Priestess above. There are some bodies in the spikes that hold 3x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"), 1x [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"), 5x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch") and 5x [Holy Water Urn](/Holy+Water+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Holy Water Urn").   
  
Hit the switch in the pilar in the end of the room to open a door on the right to a small room with a metal chest, the chest contains a [Dragon Stone](/Dragon+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Stone") that you will need later.   
  
There will be Ghost Sanctum Knights that you can not kill yet, so run into the room on your right. At the end of this room, there is a carved ladder that allows you to climb to where the Sanctum Priestess is. Kill her and hit the switch on the ceiling to remove the spikes below. Ahead is another Priestess and another Ghost Sanctum Knight, kill the Priestess and ignore the Ghost Sanctum Knight and hit the switch to open a shortcut. Go back to near the pillar with the switch for the Dragon Stone, keep going forward and you will reach a set of stairs going down. Go down a few steps and look back, on the wall on the left there will be a switch, hit it with an arrow and it will open a hidden wall that leads to a bonfire. Go back up and up the ladder on the right side, near the chest that had the Dragon stone. Run and jump the gap to light a bonfire, the **[Hidden Sanctum Chamber](/Hidden+Sanctum+Chamber "Dark Souls 2 Hidden Sanctum Chamber") bonfire**, and pick up a [Sanctum Crossbow](/Sanctum+Crossbow "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Crossbow"). (If the Ghost Sanctum Knights are causing too many problems, you can run back up the stairs and lure them into the room where the bugs were, then run up the stairs in that room and climb the ladder back out. As the knights can't climb ladders, they'll be trapped.)   
  
Now to solidify the ghosts so you can kill them. From the **[Hidden Sanctum Chamber](/Hidden+Sanctum+Chamber "Dark Souls 2 Hidden Sanctum Chamber") bonfire**, jump back to the other side and take out the Priestess on the bridge. You'll see another bridge off to your right, that's where you need to go. (You can ignore the Priestess and the Ghost Sanctum Knight by running past them). Go down the stairs and you will find a room with 3 Ghost Knights. Destroy all the "statues" in the walls in this room (there will be a "statues" on your left and right when you enter this room), this will make all Ghost Sanctum Knights in the Sanctum visible and weaker. Kill the Knights and pick up the [Eternal Sanctum Key](/Eternal+Sanctum+Key "Dark Souls 2 Eternal Sanctum Key") and a [Sanctum Knight Helm](/Sanctum+Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight Set"). Once you've finished what you needed to do here, go back up the stairs and drop off the ledge on your right for a chest that contains a [Bloodbite Ring+1](/Bloodbite+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bloodbite Ring"). Now you can kill the Sanctum Knights, so go ahead and dispatch them to pick up the items where the spiked floor was and the chest that contains a [Dragon Stone](/Dragon+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Stone").   
  
Go back to the bridge where the Priestess stood. Walk till the middle of the walkway and on the left there will a rotating stone with a large and a small hole, like the one you found earlier. Shoot an arrow to the switch you can see inside to rotate it. Drop down and get closer to the small hole, shoot another arrow to the switch. Go back up the ladder and to the end of the walkway, shoot a final arrow to the switch. Drop down and enter that room, inside there will be a chest that contains the miracle [Denial](/Denial "Dark Souls 2 Denial").   
  
Head back to the room that had spikes on the floor and this time go down the narrow steps on the left side. Kill the Sanctum Knight and continue. Go right, down the stairs and into the corridor on the right. Go through the doorway on the right and down the stairs. Pick up a [Old Growth Balm](/Old+Growth+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Old Growth Balm"). Down 2 more sets of stairs and you will be invaded by [Jester Thomas](/Jester+Thomas "Dark Souls 2 Jester Thomas").   
  
After dealing with the invader, go through the next doorway and you will be in shallow waters surrounded by giant lizard-like enemies, the Imperfects. Keep to your left and fight them carefully, they are tough. Treasure on corpses include: [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") x3, [Soul of a Great Hero](/Soul+of+a+Great+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Great Hero") x1, [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root") x2, [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") x3. Keep going forward, sticking to the left and you will find another bonfire, the **[Lair of the Imperfect](/Lair+of+the+Imperfect "Dark Souls 2 Lair of the Imperfect") bonfire**.   
  
From the bonfire keep going to the left path, you need to kill 2 or 3 more of those enemies, or run by them. When you get out of the water you will see some stairs leading to a circular stone. Use the [Dragon Stone](/Dragon+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Stone") here to create a path that will lead to [Dragon's Rest](/Dragon%27s+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Rest"). Enter the next building and you will see an obelisk and a cave entrance. Hit the obelisk to enable the elevator and go through the cave. You will find a body that has the [Drakeblood Greatsword](/Drakeblood+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Drakeblood Greatsword"). Go up the elevator and on the next level you will see another elevator and an exit that leads to [Dragon's Rest](/Dragon%27s+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Rest"), nearby is a corpse with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") x1. The elevator will take you the first bonfire of [Shulva - Sanctum City](/Shulva+-+Sanctum+City "Dark Souls 2 Shulva - Sanctum City"). Head on up the stairs and enter [Dragon's Rest](/Dragon%27s+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Rest").
