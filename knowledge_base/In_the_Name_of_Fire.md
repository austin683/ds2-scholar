[Immolation](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Immolation) (its a visual trick.. see below)   
Strategy:   
Close combat:   
Start with immolation.. its a risk.. try only if are badass... The visual of immolation makes the other players rolls to flee... so use Flame swathe while he is rolling and he can't escape from the spell.. probably OHKO..   
Other way, Great Combustion is very strong sell and very fast.. you don't need a weapon..   
Ranged Combat:   
Dual Avelyn with power stance fires 6 shots.. causing large damage.. if the players rolls.. flame swathe .. X)
