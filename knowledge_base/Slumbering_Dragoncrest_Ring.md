**Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **The Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring** , an ancient relic from the [Melfian Magic Academy](/Melfia "Dark Souls 2 Melfia"), features an image of a serenely sleeping dragon. This ring effectively muffles the sounds emitted by its wearer. The academy's origins remain elusive, its history marked by repeated disbandment and reformation. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> Sotfs: An old ring of the Melfian Magic Academy. Depicts a soundly slumbering dragon. Masks the sounds made by its wearer. Though unknown for certain, some say the founders of the academy were sinful men who came from across the northern seas. The sorceries they left behind were fragmentary, and barely legible, leading to the loss of much of their wisdom.
