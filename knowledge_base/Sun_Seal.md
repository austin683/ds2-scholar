**Sun Seal** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **Sun Seal** is the ring of the Heirs to the Sun covenant. It modestly enhances miracle attack power. The veneration of the sun, a belief now obscured by time, was once fervently embraced by mighty warriors. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> Ring of the Heirs to the Sun covenant. Slightly increases miracle attack power. Worship of the sun, now a lost belief, was once widespread amongst great warriors. Members of this covenant can leave their golden signs to be more easily summoned to join their brethren in jolly cooperation."

### DS2 Sun Seal Tips and Notes

  * Does not boost the damage of offensive hexes cast with a sacred chime.
  * The 5% effect seems to not only scale with lightning damage and is affected by the tier of miracle used. For example Great lightning spear gains ~100 damage with 187 lightning damage and 53 faith using the dragon's chime fully upgraded but Sunlight Spear gains ~230 damage. (if it was only a flat 5% the expected damage increase would be between 25-60 damage). Overall a great ring even in NG++. (Gonna need more information and sources regarding these tests. I did my own testing and the results were consistently a 5% increase of damage regardless of the tier of miracle used. I can't provide video/screenshot proof myself but I did my own testing and recorded the numbers obtained multiple times from various end-game enemies. Without a source on that scaling/tier damage bonus there's no reason to believe that the damage boost is anything but a flat 5% increase. It might be different for PvP but it doesn't change that I was not getting a damage bonus higher than 5% against enemy mobs. This was tested on the PC version after v1.03 release.)
  * Effect stacks with [Lightning Clutch Ring](/Lightning+Clutch+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Lightning Clutch Ring").
