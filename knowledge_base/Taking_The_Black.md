##  **Taking The Black** (Game of Thrones - Nights' Watch) PVP Build

  

###  This build focuses on using the Llewellyn armor set and creating a character that is pure melee with fast attacks. There are some strict rules to follow with this build and are outlined below:

#### 

###  1\. Weapons can only be infused with Raw or no infusion.

###  2\. No resin uses except poison, fire and dark are permitted.

###  3\. You must always wear the Llewellyn Armor.

###  4\. Arms, legs and head can be outfitted as you wish, but keep it inline with a Nights' Watch feel. i.e. No Havel helms, Looking Glass Knight helms etc.. Keep the helm simple… or if you're feeling like a true ranger, then no helm at all!

###  5\. ABSOLUTELY NO MAGIC WHATSOEVER!!! The only "magic" you have are urns and bombs.

###  6\. No weapons that have innate elemental damage or weapons that can self buff. NO MAGIC PURE AND SIMPLE!!

###  7\. No Black Dragon Weapons!

  

###  Below are the weapon classes that are acceptable and not acceptable compiled into separate lists.

  

###  Acceptable weapon classes:

####  **Daggers, Straight Swords, Greatswords, Thrusting Swords, Axes, Hammers, Spears, Halberds, Bows, Crossbows, Small Shields and Shields.**

###  Unacceptable weapon classes:

####  **Ultra Greatswords, Curved Swords, Curved Greatswords, Katanas, Great Hammers, Lances, Reapers, Whips, Claws, Great Bows and Great Shields.**

  

###  Some weapons of note that may be used despite the above rules:

####  **Barefist, Caestus, Zweihander, Archdrake Mace, Drakekeeper's Warpick, Stone Twinblade**

###  …And some that may not be used:

####  **Avelyn, Binoculars, Shield Crossbow, Channeler's Trident**

  

###  Everything else is pretty much up to you. The Raw infusion rule does make things tough but you are a member of the Nights' Watch. Be creative! Use knives, items and skill to win the day.

  

###  Below I have formulated an example stat investment, but feel free to adjust it to whatever weapon takes your fancy. Just remember the rules!

  
**LEVEL: 150**   

#####  **VGR: 82 / END: 30 / VIT: 20 / ATN: 6 / STR: 20 / DEX: 8 / ADP: 25 / INT: 6 / FTH: 6**

  
**The equipment I use with the above build:**   
**Drakekeeper Helm (cool looking and kind of fits the feel),**   
**Llewellyn Armor (of course),**   
**Havel's Guantlets (the only piece out of this set that looks ok),**   
**Drakekeeper Boots (for more black badassness).**   
**Drakekeeper's Sword, Dagger, Llewellyn Shield, Third Dragon Ring, Ring of Giants+2, Life Ring+2, Stone Ring.**
