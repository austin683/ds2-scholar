### Vengarl's Gloves Description

_"Gauntlets worn by the ferocious Vengarl of Forossa. As Vengarl's helmet suggests, he was not unlike a mad beast on the battlefield."_  
_"Armor/Gloves/Boots of the ferocious Vengarl of Forossa. Vengarl was known as a raging, deadly warrior. Even Forossa's Lion Knights, a motley crew of rabid fighters, kept him at arm's length."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Once you've found the [Head of Vengarl](/Head+of+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Head of Vengarl") in a clearing in the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"), exhaust all of his dialogue options. Once you get access to his menu, be sure to learn his [Gesture](/Gestures "Dark Souls 2 Gestures"), but also keep selecting the talk option. Do it repeatedly until he thanks you for your time and give you Vengarl's Helm.
  * After defeating [The Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja") go to her primal bonfire. It's guarded by Vengarl headless body. Defeat him and talk to his head in Shaded Woods. He give you remaining armor pieces, and also sells his swords.
