### DS2 Fume Sword Hints and Tips

  * Has slightly more range than the [Drakekeepers Sword](/Drakekeepers+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeepers Sword") making it the longest straight sword.
  * Upgraded with Petrified Dragon Bones.
  * Consumes vastly more stamina than most other straightswords while dealing modest damage unless dark infused.
  * Has above average poise damage and one of only four straight-swords with 120 counter damage.
  * Has the same moveset as [Sun Sword](/Sun+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Sun Sword").
  * While having less scaling than the [Crypt Blacksword](/Crypt+Blacksword "Dark Souls 2 Crypt Blacksword"), this weapon requires a much lower stat investment, which makes it a viable side arm for a dedicated hexer when dark infused and buffed.
  * For Dex dedicated hexers, **DO NOT** infuse with Dark, use [Dark Pine Resin](/Dark+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pine Resin") to pull this sword to full potential while retaining its S scaling on Dex. Infusing with Dark drops Dex scaling to A and Dark scaling only improves to B.
