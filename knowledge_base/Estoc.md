**Estoc** is a [weapon](/Weapons "weapon") in **Dark Souls 2**.

> _A large thrusting sword with a blade. The sturdy, slender long blade is designed to pierce the armor of enemies, and its strong attack can even inflict damage upon foes hiding behind shields.  
> _  
> _Though primarily a thrusting sword, its blade can also be used to slash your enemy._

###  **Acquired From**

  * Sold by [Blacksmith Lenigrast](/Blacksmith+Lenigrast) for 1500 souls
  * Rare drop from [Hollow Soldier](/Hollow+Soldier).
  * Drops from [Forest Grotesque](/Forest+Grotesque).(SOTFS)

###  **Hints and Tips**

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite) to +10.
  * Curiously, when dual-wielded with the [Broken Straight Sword](/Broken+Straight+Sword) (Broken Straight Sword in the left hand), L1 attacks cost just as much stamina as R1 attacks, but with the additional damage bonus.
  * This is the only thrusting sword that scales better with STR than DEX.
  * When infused, the strength scaling of this weapon will remain a C in most cases while DEX-scaling will drop to E.
  * The Estoc's strong attack slash can be executed almost immediately following a normal attack with a thrusting sword in the opposite hand. Very flexible weapon for early-mid game melee builds.
  * You can attack while blocking with thrusting swords, but it isn't recommended doing this in PvP. These attacks cost much more stamina, have less range, awkward aiming and unfortunately, you will use this attack accidentally a lot (because you also do this attack 'just after' blocking).
