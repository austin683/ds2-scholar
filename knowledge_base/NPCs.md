**NPCs** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are non-playable characters that players can usually interact with. Below is a list of all NPCs in Dark Souls II and their functions. If you kill an NPC, a tombstone will appear at their original location. The appearance of the tombstone is not immediate and can take quite a while, multiple hours of gameplay may be necessary depending on how many NPCs you've slaughtered. If multiple NPCs are killed, tombstones will appear in order of the NPC's death. Players can visit tombstones and pay souls to resurrect NPCs as ghosts. Ghost NPCs provide the same functions they do as when they're alive. If the player is killed after reviving an NPC, payment will be required to resurrect the NPC again.

### White Phantoms in Dark Souls 2

**White Phantoms** are benevolent spirits summoned by players seeking assistance in the perilous world of Drangleic. These ethereal allies appear as spectral figures, their purpose to aid the summoner in overcoming challenging enemies and daunting bosses. Here's what you need to know about White Phantoms:

  * **Summoning Mechanics:** Players can summon **White Phantoms** by using a [White Sign Soapstone](/White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 White Sign Soapstone"), an item that leaves a summoning sign on the ground for others to interact with. When someone activates the sign, the White Phantom is summoned into their world.
  * **Cooperative Gameplay:** **White Phantoms** are valuable allies, providing support in battles, drawing aggro from enemies, and increasing the chances of survival. Cooperation is key, and successful collaboration can lead to shared victory and rewards.
  * **Time Limit:** The assistance of **White Phantoms** is not unlimited. A time limit governs their presence in the host player's world, encouraging efficient progression and cooperation.

### Red Phantoms in Dark Souls 2

Contrasting the helpful **White Phantoms** , **Red Phantoms** embody the competitive nature of Dark Souls 2 multiplayer. These hostile spirits invade other players' worlds with the intent to engage in combat and hinder progress. Here's a closer look at Red Phantoms:

  * **Invasion Mechanics** : **Red Phantoms** invade other players' worlds through the use of [Cracked Red Eye Orbs](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb") or [Red Sign Soapstone](/Red+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 Red Sign Soapstone"). The invasion mechanic introduces an element of unpredictability, as players may find themselves facing unexpected challenges.
  * **PvP Combat:** Once invaded, the host player must contend with the **Red Phantom** in a Player versus Player (PvP) encounter. This can range from duels to chaotic skirmishes, adding an extra layer of challenge to the overall experience.
  * **Rewards and Consequences** : Successful **Red Phantoms** are rewarded with items such as [Cracked Blue Eye Orbs](/Cracked+Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Blue Eye Orb") or [Tokens of Spite](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite"). However, failure may result in penalties such as the loss of Humanity or Souls, making every invasion a high-stakes gamble.
