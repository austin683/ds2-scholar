### Lifegem Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Although it isn't as powerful as the larger variations of lifegems it can handle most occasions where you would use an Estus Flask and is much easier to acquire than the other variations. Keeping some on hand isn't a bad idea, although these lifegems will likely see less use once you start NG+.
