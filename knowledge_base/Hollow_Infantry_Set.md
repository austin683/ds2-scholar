**Hollow Infantry Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Helm/Armor/Gloves/Boots worn by Hollowed infantry.  
>   
> A piece of basic, minimal equipment. Worse yet, they're worn and nearly falling apart. Not recommended unless your options are spent.

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") and [No-Man's Wharf](/No-man's+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man's Wharf").

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Regular [Infantry Set](/Infantry+Set "Dark Souls 2 Infantry Set") has the exact same weight, but is superior in every other way (~25% in physical defenses, ~50% in elemental defenses, +15 durability).
