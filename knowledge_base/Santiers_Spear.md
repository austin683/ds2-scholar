**Santier's Spear** is a weapon in Dark Souls 2.

  
  
_"A spear that was embedded in a stone statue._   
_According to an old local legend, a great spear was used to defeat Santier, the walking statue. Perhaps this is that very spear._   
_But it will be difficult to utilize such a thing in the manner of a spear. Your only choice is to swing it around, and smite foes about the head."_

###  **Acquired From**

  * Treasure at [Doors of Pharros: Gyrm's Respite bonfire](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros").
  * The doorway is in the middle of the right-hand wall when entering the main area from the Gyrm's Respite bonfire room. Be wary of the primal knight behind the door. Even if you only open the bottom door, He can still hit you.
  * There are three Lockstone slots - one on each side of the doorway, and one under the water directly in front of the door. If a lockstone is used on the middle slot under the water, the door can be rolled through without using all three slots.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgraded with Twinkling Titanite.
  * You can deplete its durability to break the embedded head and turn this weapon into an effective, quick spear. The weapon will stay this way from now on, it will be impossible to "repair" and it will not lose its durability further, effectively making it unbreakable. However, if you die or rest at a bonfire prior to breaking the spear completely, its durability will be restored to full.
  * Once the durability is depleted, this is the one and only weapon with technically INFINITE DURABILITY, extremely useful on a no death, no bonfire playthrough.
  * Mundane is no longer viable as the weapon loses almost all damage making raw one of the best infusions, while Enchanted is the best option, as it will outscale Raw once reached 50int.
  * This weapon was extremely popular in PVP due to its power and large hitbox that can catch players off-guard. As of Calibration 1.06, this weapon has had its attack power reduced especially on mundane infuse (reduce base damage to 30), to balance it out, making it less viable against other players and bosses.
  * Highly recommended to wield it with Yorgh's Spear together. Both movesets together allow for variable and unpredictable attacks, and a Santier rolling R1 + Yorgh R2 combo.
  * It is possible to powerstance this weapon.
  * If you're attempting to break the statue head by playing through areas of the game, you can select the "leave" option in the inventory to leave it beside the bonfire you want to rest at. You can then rest as normal, repairing your gear and replenishing your Estus. When you then pick the spear up again, it will not have been repaired. 

  
**Methods to****break the stone head:**

  * Hitting walls, for example the Bright Cove Tseldora tent interior. 
    * Note that acid does not directly affect the weapon, and cannot be broken via acid surge or pools of acid. It must be broken by hitting either enemies or walls. 
  * Hitting dead enemies (stacking up corpses and using 2h strong attack is highly recommended). On the first bonfire of FoFG, lure about 4 enemies and try to kill them in a way that all fall in the same location. Then, hit the bodies with 2H strong attack. This will break the stone head in less than one minute.
  * Hitting non-aggressive enemies (ie. Rat Covenant Primal Knights).
  * Repeatedly hitting Dyna and Tillo (using the 2h strong attack), as they are invulnerable.

The best way is to be part of The Rat Covenant (wear ring and they will become non-hostile then repeatedly hit the Mastadons in Door of Pharros with the 1hd strong attack it will break in a couple of minutes.

**SOTFS-** The only viable method that doesn't take hours is hitting the crows nest. Start with your back to the ladder and perform as many 2H R2 attacks as you can, back up and repeat. Should take 1-3 minutes depending on your stamina. 

  
**Moveset:**

  * After breaking the head, the moveset of this weapon will include spear, halberd, curved sword, and twinblade attacks, giving it one of the most diverse movesets in the game. Due to this, the Santiers Spear is highly common in PVP combat 
    * 1 handed: 
      * first and second light attack - spear
      * first and second strong attack - halberd
      * roll light attack - twinblade
      * backstep/run light attack - curved sword
    * 2 handed: 
      * first and second light attack - twinblade
      * first strong attack - twinblade
      * light attack to strong attack - twinblade
      * strong attack to strong attack - halberd
      * roll light attack - twinblade
      * backstep/run light attack - halberd
