_"Robe worn by Hollowed Drangleic mages._  
  
_Drangleic mages wore different garb depending on their sex. What function this served, however, is unknown, as with many old practices. This is a men's hood/robe."_

### Location

  * Drops from [Hollow Mage](/Hollow+Mage) in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora).

### Notes

  * Part of the [White Hollow Mage Set](/White+Hollow+Mage+Set). 
    * Compared to the [Black Hollow Mage Set](/Black+Hollow+Mage+Set), the white hood is superior to the black counterpart, while the robe is inferior, it, however, weights less than the black hollow mage set.
    * It is implied the [Hollow Mages](/Hollow+Mage) are male.
  * Upgraded from [Titanite](/Titanite+Slab).
