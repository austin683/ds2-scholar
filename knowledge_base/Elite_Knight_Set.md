**Elite Knight Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

_"Helmet (Armor/Gloves/Leggings) made of bradden steel. Provides sturdy defense, making it an old-time favorite of elite knights._   
_"Bradden steel is used widely in Drangleic. This fine alloy is made from ores mined in the southern kingdom."_

###  Set Location

  * Sold by [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer) (11,6k) in [Majula](/Majula). The player must spend at least 1,000 souls at Maughlin's shop, leave, rest at a bonfire, and return.
  * Elite Knight set +5 is dropped (not guaranteed) by [red phantoms](/Greatbow+Phantom) that spawn on NG+ ([Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic) works too) by the King's Gate bonfire on the way to [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want). 
    * [Scholar of the First Sin] No one spawns on the path to Throne of Want.
  * Elite Knights in [Eleum Loyce](/Eleum+Loyce) (one at the bridge, next to Pharros contraption, one just before Inner Wall bonfire) drop pieces of this set.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Titanite").
