### Falconer Gloves Description

_"Gloves worn by the Volgen Falconers."_  
_"Domestic Volgen soldiers are infamously timid, so it is no wonder that this fierce band of mercenary falconers was hired to compensate._  
_In practice they serve as bodyguards for the affluent elite, and they serve well, such that nobody dares scrutinize their backgrounds."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Starting gear (no helmet) for Knight Class
  * Sold by [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer)
  * Obtained from Volgen Falconer enemies in NG+ in the start area of [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt).

### 

### Notes
