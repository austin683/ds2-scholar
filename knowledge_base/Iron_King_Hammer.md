### DS2 Iron King Hammer Hints and Tips

  * Reinforced with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone#fex "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone#fex") to +5. Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * One- and two-handed R2s are overhead smashes that ignite the weapon. On impact with the ground, a small area around the weapon will be engulfed in flames. Follow-up R2s after the first hit will not re-ignite the weapon; only the first hit in the combo will get the special fire attack.
  * This weapon scales with strength and dexterity for the physical damage, and intelligence and faith for the fire damage.
  * It is not clear if this is due to lag, but there have been occasions when the IKH was parried and the second attack still hit the defender. This can result in the defender dying from an attack he parried.
  * While the area of effect is very wide it is has very short vertical reach; an enemy can actually jump through it.
  * The wide sweeping attacks coupled with the area damage make this weapon excellent for punishing backstabbers.
  * The weapon has a short reach. This is a disadvantage in open areas but very useful in cramped ones where the opponent might have trouble attacking you. Cramped quarters also make it very hard for them to avoid your AoE attacks.
