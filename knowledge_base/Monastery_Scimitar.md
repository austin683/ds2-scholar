**Monastery Scimitar** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Monastery Scimitar** is a **[Curved Sword](/Curved+Swords "Dark Souls 2 Curved Swords")** with a strong emphasis on dexterity scaling. Known for its quick and precise slashing attacks, it caters to characters who prioritize agility in combat

  

Requirements: STR 9 / E, DEX 22 / S(*A)

Weapon Type: Curved Sword

Attack Type: Slash

Enchantable: Yes

Special: No

*When infused: 133 physical dmg/133 elemental dmg and B scaling with chosen element. Dex scaling changes to A. 

> Crafted at the Lindelt Monastery to replicate an ancient, sacred scimitar characterized by its uniquely shaped tip.   
>   
>  When a true master wields this scimitar, their graceful chained attacks are described as mystical dances, and their deadly slashes as lingering nightmares. 

###  **Acquired From**

  * Rare drop from Black Phantom found in NG+ (or NG with ascetic) in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep") near the 2nd bonfire behind a painting.(Does **NOT** drop 100% with Bonfire intensity 7.)
  * The phantom does not respawn after it's killed, so in order to farm it you need to use [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic")s or wait until the next game cycle/journey.
  * The drop chance seems to have been increased for the Scholar of the First Sin version of the game. Note that the phantom also drops pieces of its [set](/Monastery+Set "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Set").

  
  
**Notes:**

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Visually, this weapon is the equivalent of the Painting Guardian Sword found in the first Dark Souls.
  * Has a longer active parry window than other scimitars.
  * Has a unique strong attack when wielded on the main hand that performs a series of spinning attacks.
  * Wielding this weapon offhand and using the strong attack after using the normal attack of the mainhand weapon will perform the elegant spinning attack instead of the typical parry. You must have enough str/dex to power stance the weapons but you don't need to actually be in power stance mode.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Has a unique parry animation with zero-length starting animation and rather long parrying window which allows for a very quick parry. This feature was removed in Calibration patch 1.10 but then was later brought back (which suggests that the unique parry was always intended to be that way).
