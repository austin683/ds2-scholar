**Spell Quartz Ring** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). The **Spell Quartz Ring** is granted to students meeting specific standards at the Melfian Magic Academy. Crafted by Pyromancer Glocken, these replicas, infused with soul-based quartz, elevate magic defense. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.
