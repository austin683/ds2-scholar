> "An ancient miracle of the sun.  
> Reinforces weapon in other hand with sunlight, a form of lightning.  
>   
> The sun grants life to all things upon the earth, even if the worshipers of sunlight no longer bless the surface with their presence."

### Acquired From

  * Can be bought for 12400 from [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis") after clearing [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt").
  * Found in the [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana"), between the second and third bonfires. In a chest down a long, treacherous path past the Ogre and guarded by two Amana Priestesses. Hidden in the water in an iron chest at the very end of the path, right after an estus flask shard.

### Notes

  * Buffs weapon with lightning damage. Duration scales with Faith: 63 sec. at 36 faith, and up to 99 sec. at 54 faith. Equivalent to [Crystal Magic Weapon](/Crystal+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Magic Weapon") and [Dark Weapon](/Dark+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Dark Weapon") in effectiveness.
  * DS2's buff formula differs from other Souls games, instead relying primarily on the targeted weapon's base damage to determine how much AR the spell buff will add. Matching the spell buff with a damage type present on a weapon will add a flat bonus to the total AR, depending on whatever the weapon is infused with and/or naturally inflicts said damage type. A small scaling bonus is also added unless the targeted weapon doesn't scale at all with any stats.
  * I've decided to test Sunlight Blade and Flame Weapon buffs for sake of comparison. With str 12, dex 20, faith 50, int 3, Ring of Blades +1, I used two partizans +10; lightning infused partizan with total damage 200+207, and fire infused partizan with total damage 200+201. For consistency, I ensured that the attacks tested were always a non-sweetspot counter hits, on the first manikin at Lower Earthen Peak bonfire, who seemed to take exactly 5 less fire damage than lightning damage from unbuffed hits, meaning his fire and lightning resistances are the same, within ~1 damage margin of error. I've also accounted for the 6 damage difference between the weapons, and added that damage to the final results. They should be accurate within 2-3 damage margin of error.

Flame Weapon added 63 damage to the lightning partizan, and 70 damage to the fire partizan - 3.5% increase due to innate fire damage.

Sunlight blade added 97 damage to the fire partizan, and 104 damage to the lightning partizan - 3.5% increase due to innate lightning damage.

Since both weapons had almost exactly 50:50 split, with the above stats the innate damage accounts for only 3.5% increase, and can be effectively ignored.

Assuming enemy has equal fire and lightning resistance, single cast Sunlight Blade will provide 50% stronger buff than Flame Weapon. However, Sunlight Blade provides only 1-3 total casts of the buff, while Flame weapon provides 4-8; for low attunement builds, Flame Weapon will provide 360 seconds uptime at minimum, while sunlight blade will provide only 90 seconds at minimum. Overall, number of lightning resistant enemies seems to be lower, but number of fire vulnerable enemies seems higher. Flame Weapon is also obtainable earlier (requires bonfire ascetic), and has an extremely quiet sound effect compared to Sunlight Blade.
