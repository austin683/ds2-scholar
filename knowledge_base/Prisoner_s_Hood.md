_"Rags worn by imprisoned Hollows. This appears to have been worn on the head._

_Judging by its looks and apparent virtues, this really is no more than a tattered scrap of cloth. It still carries the stench of a Hollow."_

### Location

  * Dropped by the Prisoner enemies in [The Gutter](/Gutter).
  * Dropped by the Hollows in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse).
  * Dropped by the Hollows in [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt) (rare)
  * Dropped by the Hollows in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley)

### Notes

  * Part of the [Prisoner's Set](/Prisoner's+Set).  

    * One way to obtain the entire set is to fight hollows just after the 2nd Undead Crypt bonfire; they spawn infinitely (throughout multiple gravestones) and do not require a rest at the bonfire for them to respawn (albeit, the drop rate is rarer than in other locations).
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite+Slab).
  * The helmet and chest pieces raise item discovery.
  * Prisoners in Harvest Valley and the Gutter drop variations of the tatters and the hood
