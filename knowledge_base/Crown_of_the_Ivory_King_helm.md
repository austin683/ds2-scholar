**Crown of the Ivory King** is a [Helm](/Helms "Dark Souls 2 Helms") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki").

_Crown of the Ivory King who once ruled this land._   
  
_Far to the North, a King built a great cathedral to appease the raging flame. But when he sensed the degradation of his soul, he left without a word, leaving everything to Alsanna, who had, unbeknownst, found a place at his side._   
  
_But these were events of long ago, and today, no one even remembers the King's name._

### Location

  * Picked up from a pillar of light that appears once [Burnt Ivory King](/Burnt+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Burnt Ivory King") is defeated in [The Old Chaos](/Old+Chaos "Dark Souls 2 Old Chaos").

### Crown of the Ivory King Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Upgraded physical defenses are only 25% higher.
  * Grants slow HP regeneration – 40 HP/minute (the effect stacks with [Ring of Restoration](/Ring+of+Restoration "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Restoration"), [Loyce Shield](/Loyce+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Shield") and [Charred Loyce Shield](/Charred+Loyce+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Shield")).
  * [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") in [Memory of the King](/Memory+of+the+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the King") will react with a new set of dialogues to this and the other two crowns.
  * When worn after receiving [Vendrick's Blessing](/Vendrick's+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick's Blessing"), it will prevent hollowing after death, and completely protect from curse buildup. This effect only works in current playthrough.
