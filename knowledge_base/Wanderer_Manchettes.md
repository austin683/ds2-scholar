### Wanderer Manchettes Description

_"Gauntlets for the roving type._  
_Light, sturdy leather made for long journeys."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Starting equipment from the Swordman.
  * [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille): Knock the rock into the well and kill the three mummy enemies, the third one drops the entire set. They do not respawn (Not even with Ascetics). 
    * Note: I did not get the drop. I lured them into the first courtyard, below the Heide Knight. Not sure if that's why...
    * I climbed the ladder in their spawn area and picked them off and it did not drop. I did the same thing on another character though and it did drop. No idea if that affects it.

### 

### Notes

  * Don't blow them up with magic/bomb when they are still in the cage. You can't reach the drop there, not even with jumping. ***It is possible to make the jump into the cage** *  
Upgraded with [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard)
