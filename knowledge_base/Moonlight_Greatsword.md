### DS2 Moonlight Greatsword Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with Petrified Dragon Bones.
  * Cannot be buffed anymore as of 1.03 patch.
  * Possesses a unique heavy attack both one handed and two handed: 1h is a horizontal magic beam with a vertical follow-up ground smash. 2h's are a vertical magic beam with a horizontal follow-up. 
    * A power-stance heavy attack will not fire this beam unlike some other special attacks.
    * Since the damage of the beams is Magic damage, it scales purely on your Magic AR, regardless of the infusion on the weapon.
  * The beams have a slight Area of Effect (AoE) upon colliding with an entity, dealing damage to any enemy around it. 
    * The damage of the beams will be concentrated on the target it collided with, while the AoE effect will deal smaller amounts of damage.
    * These beams benefit from the listed Counter Damage of this weapon.
    * Despite the AoE effect and visuals, the beams can only destroy breakable furniture when directly colliding with it. Any furniture around the main target will remain unscathed.
  * This attack costs 10 durability to use, however the [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring") and its variants reduce this cost to 8, 7 and 5 respectively. With the required 18 int to wield this weapon, the [Repair](/Repair "Dark Souls 2 Repair") spell can be used to increase the number of uses of this attack without needing to buy [Repair Powders](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder") or sitting at a bonfire.
  * From 18 to 38 int, the Raw infusion wins over both the Regular and Magic infusions. Above 39, the Magic Infusion becomes the strongest. (448 AR Magic vs 488 AR Raw at 18 int, 512 AR Magic vs 511 AR Raw at 39 int)
  * The Enchanted infusion converts the weapon’s magic damage to physical, resulting in the heavy attack dealing no damage, as its damage scales entirely off your magic AR. Strangely enough, this also raises your physical block from 60% to 93,3%. (425 physical AR at 18 int, 445 AR at 39 int)
