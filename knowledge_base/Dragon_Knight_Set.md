**Archdrake Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Helmet/Robes/Gloves/Boots worn by the Archdrake sect of Lindelt.  
>   
> Though little is actually known about the order, it is said their well-honed miracles and unwavering faith in the face of death made them worthy rivals to Drangleic's forces in their day.

  
**Scholar of the First Sin changed to:

> Helmet/Robes/Gloves/Boots worn by the Archdrake sect of Lindelt.  
>   
> Little is known about the Archdrake sect and its ancient rituals, and those who dare to indulge their curiosity have been known to simply vanish.  
>   
> The Archdrake sect are the keepers of Lindelt's histories, including the only record of its foundation, a tome they have good reason to keep hidden away.

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Archdrake Pilgrims](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana").
  * Archdrake Robes are also found in [The Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"): close to the well where you find [Wanderer set](/Wanderer+Set "Dark Souls 2 Wanderer Set"), there's a storage with explosive barrels – detonate them to reveal a hidden room containing the robes and [Archdrake Shield](/Archdrake+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Shield").

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Helm grants +1 to INT.
  * Helm offers the highest lightning defense.
  * Robe offers second highest lightning defense (almost equal to that of [Lucatiel's](/Lucatiel's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel's Set") vest, [Priestess](/Priestess+Set "Dark Souls 2 Priestess Set") and [Saint's](/Saint's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Saint's Set") robes)
  * Originally it was named the Dragonknight Set and the Archdrake sect of Lindelt was named Silverdrake Knights of Lindelt.
