Use Dark Darkdrift and throne watcher shield   
3rd dragon ring, +2 ring of blades, +2 cloranthy ring, other is your choice   
armor is also your choice thought i like to use the alonne knight head, gloves, and boots W/ alvas armor   
it has high damage output and can easily surise people. BTW use 2h strong attack its faster.   
it also can destroy people that dont have armor on.
