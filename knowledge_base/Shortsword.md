The **Shortsword** is a Straight Sword that can be upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10. It stands out as one of the few straight swords, alongside the [Foot Soldier Sword](/Foot+Soldier+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Foot Soldier Sword") and [Ashen Warrior Sword](/Ashen+Warrior+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior Sword"), featuring a complete set of thrusting attacks.

> A small straight sword. Longer than a dagger, but still lightweight.  
>   
> Widely used, as it requires no particular strength.  
>   
> A reasonable choice that will suffice in many situations, but not the thing to take along if you expect to face any serious challenge.

### How to get Shortsword in Dark Souls 2

  * Treasure in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"): From the Crestfallen's Retreat bonfire, continue down the path to the right and up the ladder, dealing with hollow infantry along the way. At the top of the ladder, hug the wall to the right and you find a second ladder. Be wary of a hollow infantryman coming down the ladder to attack you. After climbing this one, you will find yourself atop the wall looking down on the courtyard. Run along it, killing the hollow soldier in your way. After jumping over a gap, you will find a corpse with the weapon.
  * Starting equipment for the [Swordsman](/Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Swordsman") class, already at +1.

### DS2 Shortsword Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * The only straight sword other than the [Foot Soldier Sword](/Foot+Soldier+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Foot Soldier Sword"), and [Ashen Warrior Sword](/Ashen+Warrior+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior Sword") with a complete set of thrusting attacks.
  * Fast attack speed, decent damage, acceptable reach, light weight, and low stamina consumption.
  * Compared to the [Longsword](/Longsword "Dark Souls 2 Longsword") this weapon has slightly lower reach and damage, but also lower stamina drain, weight, and base requirements. Interestingly enough, the scaling is identical.
  * Higher counter damage and easier access to thrusting attacks means the Shortsword can potentially outdamage its longer counterpart in some situations especially when using the [Old Leo Ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring").
