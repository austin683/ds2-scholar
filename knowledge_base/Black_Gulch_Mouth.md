#  Black Gulch Mouth

* * *

##  Location:

Right at the start of the Black Gulch area, in a cave to the left.   
  

##  Bosses:

  * None

  

##  Bonfire Ascetic Use:

Bonfire ascetics can be used to farm large titanite shards and titanite chunks of the worm enemies that reside in the black puddles. It seems like this might spawn extra enemies on NG+. It can also be used to gain another Giant Soul because it respawns the two giants (can be used to obtain 5 Giant Souls for the Vendrick boss fight).

  * Divine Blessing (in wooden chest)
  * Pharros Lockstone (?) (Does not respawn the Lockstone)
