## Things Betwixt Enemies

  

  

###  [Foreign Wanderer (Undead Traveler)](/Foreign+Wanderer)

  

**Hollow Travelers** are enemies in Dark Souls II. They can first be encountered behind the first fog wall after the [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt) bonfire.   

  * Hollow Travelers appear to be undead that sought a cure for the curse, much like the player. However, they succumbed to hollowing before they could fulfill their purpose
  * Hollow Travelers possess light weapons like daggers, bows, or none at all. They also wear very little armor, so they are minor threats; even to inexperienced players
  * Hollow Travelers deal negligible damage with their fists and arrows, but the dagger wielding ones may leave more of a scratch

  

  

###  [Prowler Hound (Kobold)](/Prowler+Hound)

  

Kobolds are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered just past the fields in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt) (they do not drop anything here).   

  * Kobolds are lemur-like critters that reside in grassy areas. They are non-hostile unless attacked by players, they tend to flee from the player unless provoked - when provoked the surrounding pack will also attack
  * Kobolds deal paltry damage and possess low defense, but can be dangerous if many are provoked at once
  * Kobolds can also be encountered in the grass by the entrance to [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep). These however, are hostile towards players, and cause bleed and petrification build-up with their attacks

  

  

###  [Ogre](/Ogre)

  

Ogres are enemies in Dark Souls II. They can first be encountered up a hidden path before the bridge leading to the Firekeepers' house in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt).   

  * Ogres resemble a cross between a cyclops and hippopotamus, and possess a horn on their foreheads
  * Ogres have large amounts of HP and deal significant damage, and their attacks are relatively swift for enemies their size
  * Ogres can grab players and devour them, guaranteeing death for players. Ranged attacks and poison are recommended when dealing with Ogres 

  

  

###  [Dark Spirit - Forrest Grotesque (Goblin)](/Dark+Spirit+-+Forrest+Grotesque) **NG+**

  

Goblins are humanoid creatures that lurk in the Shaded Woods. These deformed monstrosities give a grotesque impression and do not appear to be products of a natural evolution; rather they seem to have once been human. What twisted force could have rent their humanity and left them in this sad state...?   

  * Have the same attacks as the regular Forest Grotesques but with higher HP. Still rather easy to kill.

  

  

###  [Falconer (Hollow Falconer)](/Falconer) **NG+**

  

Falconers are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered in the fields of [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt) immediately after starting NG+ / Journey #2.   

  * Falconers are mercenaries from the city of Volgen, usually hired as bodyguards for the elite. The ones found in the fields, however, are hollow, and have no sense of their former duties
  * Falconers are equipped with swords, bows, and a falcon that can attack the player. They draw their swords at close range, fire arrows at long range, and send falcons at mid-range
  * Players must deal with multiple falconers at once when starting NG+, so players would do well to prevent getting surrounded by them

  

  

###  [Dark Spirit](/Dark+Spirit) [ Roaming Soul - Foreign Wanderer](/Roaming+Soul+-+Foreign+Wanderer) **NG+**

  

**Hollow Travelers** are enemies in Dark Souls II. They can first be encountered behind the first fog wall after the [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt) bonfire.   

  * Hollow Travelers appear to be undead that sought a cure for the curse, much like the player. However, they succumbed to hollowing before they could fulfill their purpose
  * Hollow Travelers possess light weapons like daggers, bows, or none at all. They also wear very little armor, so they are minor threats; even to inexperienced players
  * Hollow Travelers deal negligible damage with their fists and arrows, but the dagger wielding ones may leave more of a scratch
