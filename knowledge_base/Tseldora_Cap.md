**Tseldora Cap Hat** is a [Helm](/Helms "Dark Souls 2 Helms") in Dark Souls 2.

_"O_ _utfit worn by settlers of Tseldora. Rather fancy but with low defence and unfit for battle._

_Its design recalls_ T _seldora's glory days, the peak of the brightstone boom.__"_

### Location

  * Drops from [Hollowed Spiders](/Ducal+Spider "Dark Souls 2 Ducal Spider") (Prisoners with spiders on their back) within the Brightstone Cove area.
  * The full set is dropped by [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer")**[](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer")** if he is killed.  
It's recommended not to kill him before you got him in swagger-mode, because only then his gravestone incarnation will sell all items.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Tseldora Set](/Tseldora+Set "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Set").
  * Helm increases souls by 2.5%
  * The bonuses are multiplicative if multiple armor pieces are worn.
  * Every piece of this set increases the souls obtained from enemies.
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades#Ore").
