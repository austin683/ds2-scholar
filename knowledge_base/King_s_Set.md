**King's Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).  

_"An old armor that is oddly comfortable. Belonged to a King. What makes a king? Some say that it is a birthright, while others call it destiny.  
Perhaps it is not important, as long as the king's name serves to unite his people."_

###  Set Location

  * Found past the Crumbled Ruins bonfire in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana), behind the door on the left, past a narrow stone bridge guarded by a [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dragonrider"). The door only opens once [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Vendrick") is defeated and the player must be in human form to unlock the door (using [Ring of the Dead](/Ring+of+the+Dead "Ring of the Dead") won't do).

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite).
  * King's Crown grants +2 to VGR and VIT, +1 to INT and FTH, and reduces END, STR and DEX by -1. +3 INT and FTH in SOTFS. Previous number could be from standard game. Needs confirmation.
  * Crown has the durability almost twice as high as any other item in the set.
  * Requires 14 STR and 12 DEX.
