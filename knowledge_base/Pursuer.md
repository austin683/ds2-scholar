### Pursuer Information in Dark Souls 2

The Pursuer is a boss in Dark Souls 2 that manifests as an aggressive knight relentlessly hunting the player character. Encased in heavy black armor, he wields the [Pursuer's Ultra Greatsword](/Pursuer's+Ultra+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer's Ultra Greatsword") and utilizes a high-impact moveset that allows him to close distances rapidly despite his size. In the [Scholar of the First Sin](/Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin") (SotFS) edition, he appears in multiple locations as a powerful miniboss after his initial defeat in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants").

These secondary encounters differ from the primary boss fight as they yield fewer souls and feature the Pursuer in a pre-powered "curse" state. In this mode, he gains immediate access to dangerous dark magic attacks which inflict [Curse](/Curse "Dark Souls 2 Curse") on the player. These miniboss versions generally drop one [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") upon defeat. While the Pursuer will vanish into the ground and despawn if the player retreats from the immediate spawn area, his regular spawns remain consistent across playthroughs, with the notable addition of a dual-boss encounter in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") when playing on NG+ or higher difficulties.

### Dark Souls 2 The Pursuer Locations

  * Second boss encounter located on the high bridge in the Forest of Fallen Giants leading toward the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille").
  * Optional early encounter on the large raised platform near the [Cardinal Tower](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower") bonfire; defeating him here prevents his appearance at the main boss arena later in the area.
  * Scholar of the First Sin (SotFS) encounter in the courtyard with large breakable wooden towers within the Lost Bastille.
  * SotFS encounter guarding a chest in the open area left to the initial bonfire where the bird drops the player in the Lost Bastille.
  * SotFS encounter in a small arena past the room filled with gunpowder barrels and hollow dogs, located to the left of the [Tower Apart](/Tower+Apart "Dark Souls 2 Tower Apart") bonfire.
  * SotFS encounter situated directly beneath the [Servants' Quarters](/Servants'+Quarters "Dark Souls 2 Servants' Quarters") bonfire near the entrance to [Belfry Luna](/Belfry+Luna "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Luna").
  * SotFS encounter on a hidden ledge overlooking the exterior wall of the Lost Bastille, accessed via a double illusory wall in the room containing clay cages and exploding hollows.
  * SotFS encounter on the small island in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt") near the gender-change coffin; defeating the nearby ogres first is highly recommended.
  * Re-appearance in the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") within the [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon") arena after the boss has been defeated, which yields the [Ring of Blades](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades") +1.
  * Simultaneous dual-boss encounter in the [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") throne room during NG+ (Bonfire Intensity 2 or higher), dropping the [Washing Pole](/Washing+Pole "Dark Souls 2 Washing Pole") and the Ring of Blades +2.

### DKS2 The Pursuer Strategy

#### General Advice

  * Avoid a significant portion of his moveset by consistently strafing or rolling to the player's right (his shield side).
  * Constantly monitor his blade for a blue glow; if successfully impaled by this "Curse" stab, the player loses humanity and max HP while the Pursuer gains access to three dark projectile attacks.
  * Use weapons that deal Strike and Lightning damage, such as a [Mace](/Mace "Dark Souls 2 Mace") or [Morning Star](/Morning+Star "Dark Souls 2 Morning Star"), as he is heavily armored and vulnerable to these elements.
  * **Careful:** ballista rounds deal massive friendly fire damage and can kill the host or summoned phantoms instantly.

#### 

#### Mage Strategy

When engaging the Pursuer as a spellcaster, the primary goal is to maintain a medium-to-long distance to bait his signature charging dash; a highly predictable attack that offers a significant recovery window, which can be exploited for safe spellcasting.

  * Equip high-damage sorceries such as [Great Heavy Soul Arrow](/Great+Heavy+Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Great Heavy Soul Arrow") or [Great Soul Arrow](/Great+Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Great Soul Arrow") to maximize damage during limited opening windows.  
Utilize casting-speed gear like the [Black Hood](/Black+Hood "Dark Souls 2 Black Hood") or [Lion Mage Set](/Lion+Mage+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lion Mage Set") to ensure spells are fired and recovered before the Pursuer can initiate a follow-up.
  * Lock on and fire several spells immediately upon his spawn, but be prepared to dodge to the right as soon as he begins his forward glide.
  * Manage stamina carefully by using the [Blossom Kite Shield](/Blossom+Kite+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Blossom Kite Shield") or [Chloranthy Ring](/Chloranthy+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Chloranthy Ring"), as failing to have enough energy for a dodge after casting is a frequent cause of death.
  * Avoid being cornered by using the full length of arenas like the Forest of Fallen Giants or the Lost Bastille courtyards to reset your distance after every two or three spells.

#### 

#### Forest of Fallen Giants Strategy

In the Forest of Fallen Giants, the ballistae located at the rear of the arena can be utilized to end the fight rapidly. One effective method involves parrying the Pursuer's initial charging attack while he is positioned directly in the line of fire. A [Buckler](/Buckler "Dark Souls 2 Buckler") is particularly recommended for this due to its ample parry window. Once he is staggered, quickly sprint to a ballista and fire. Note that since the 1.10 patch, ballista damage has been reduced and typically requires two successful shots to kill him.

Alternatively, players can bait his charge, roll to the right, and immediately sprint to the leftmost ballista to fire before he recovers. In co-op play, one player can distract the boss while the other operates the machinery, though extreme caution is required as ballista rounds deal massive friendly fire damage and can kill the host or phantoms instantly. It is also important to protect the machinery, as the Pursuer's attacks can destroy the ballistae if he is allowed to swing near them.

#### Things Betwixt Strategy

This encounter can be accesed by using a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") on the statue near the third tutorial fog wall. It is highly recommended to defeat the nearby ogres and kick over the shortcut tree before engaging the Pursuer on the beach. If the fight becomes too difficult, retreating up the ramp will cause him to despawn.

Magic users can exploit the environment by using the [Gender Swap Coffin](/Gender+Swap+Coffin "Dark Souls 2 Gender Swap Coffin") as a permanent line-of-sight obstacle. By circle-strafing the coffin, players can safely fire spells while the Pursuer's AI is hindered by the object. This method is effective for low-level sorcerers using [Soul Arrow](/Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Soul Arrow") and [Great Soul Arrow](/Great+Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Great Soul Arrow"), though they still must remain wary of his long-reaching thrusts.

#### Drangleic Castle Strategy (Dual Pursuers)

  
The encounter in the Drangleic Castle throne room is widely considered the most difficult appearance of the Pursuer due to the presence of two bosses simultaneously. This fight only occurs on NG+ or by using a Bonfire Ascetic to reach a bonfire intensity of 2 or higher. Note that NPC phantoms summoned for the [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Throne of Want") boss fight cannot assist here, as they will automatically despawn if you attempt to lead them into the throne room.

One of the two Pursuers begins the fight in his powered-up state, giving him immediate access to a volley of homing dark orbs. When you hear a loud powering-up sound and see the boss begin to writhe, quickly move behind him; the projectiles cannot track you from that position, though you must remain alert for attacks from the second Pursuer.

It is generally advised to avoid locking on to either target until one is defeated so you can maintain a clear view of both health pools and attack patterns.

Fast-hitting weapons are preferred over slow-hitting ones, as the recovery time for heavy attacks often leaves the player vulnerable to the second Pursuer's follow-up. Effective windows for healing or attacking typically only appear after both bosses have completed a combo. Utilizing damage-over-time effects like Poison via a [Channeler's Trident](/Channeler's+Trident "Dark Souls 2 Channeler's Trident") or the [Moon Butterfly Set](/Moon+Butterfly+Set "Dark Souls 2 Moon Butterfly Set") can be effective, though the Pursuer possesses high poison resistance. For players fighting solo, consuming [Elizabeth Mushrooms](/Elizabeth+Mushroom "Dark Souls 2 Elizabeth Mushroom") for continuous health regeneration and equipping the [Blossom Kite Shield](/Blossom+Kite+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Blossom Kite Shield") for stamina recovery can provide a significant advantage.

If the dual encounter proves too overwhelming, there's a way to fight them individually; as they begin to spawn, stand near the throne room entrance and wait for one to initiate an attack animation. Quickly step out of the room and immediately return; this frequently causes the idle Pursuer to despawn while the attacking one remains. After defeating the first Pursuer, you can rest at the bonfire to repeat the process for the second one, rewarding you the [Washing Pole](/Washing+Pole "Dark Souls 2 Washing Pole") and [Ring of Blades](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades") +2.

### Pursuer Move Set
    
    
    |  | Description | Counter Measures |

    | Spinning Finisher | The Spinning Finisher is one of two finishers for his Combo Attack. / In this finisher, The Pursuer spins around in the air before lunging forward with a Sweeping slash. | Walk or roll toward his right to avoid this. The player can strafe / right to easily avoid the attack and punish after. |
    | Slam Finisher | This is the Combo Attack's other finisher. The Pursuer slams his / sword downward from overhead. | To dodge this one. roll to the side after a slight delay instead of blocking, as it is quite draining on one's stamina. |
    | Charge | The Pursuer will pull his sword down, before charging at you. He will pull his sword further back before performing an upward strike. | The easiest way to avoid his charge is by strafing right the second he starts the animation. If you are close, this is a good chance to retaliate. / If you are far away, block this one or try to roll through it. This attack is parryable, though depending on the speed of his charge, timings vary. |
    | Double Stab | The Boss will stab at you twice, and then leap into the air, before following up with a downward stab that has little range. | Strafe toward his shield to avoid the thrusts, and roll away if you are close to him. |

    | Seeking Orbs | The Pursuer charges up dark energy and then sprays orbs of dark, homing energy. These orbs will track you and inflict Curse buildup in addition to dealing damage. The Pursuer gains access to this attack after being Impaled by his cursed blade attack. | The best approach is to get right behind him where the missiles can't hit you as soon as you see him prepare the attack. That way, not only you'll be safe, you can also land multiple hits. Similar to the Affinity spell from Dark Souls 1. |
    | Spreading Orbs | The Pursuer charges up dark energy and then sprays orbs of dark, homing energy. These orbs will spread in a wide cone and inflict Curse buildup in addition to dealing damage. The Pursuer gains access to this attack after being Impaled by his cursed blade attack. | This attack is very hard to dodge or outrun - the best approach is to get right behind him where the missiles can't hit you as soon as you see him prepare the attack. |
    | Shockwave | This is a long range attack. He'll gather energy in his blade, and then launch a whirling blue wave. | As long as you stay close to him. he won't attempt it. Even if he does use this, you should be able to roll to the side to avoid it. This attack does not seem to be Spell Parryable. |
    

### Pursuer Tips

  * Evade the Pursuer's charging dash and primary three-hit combos by consistently strafing or rolling to the player's right (his shield side).
  * Bait his charging attack by backing away after a successful combo, then punish the recovery window with one or two strikes.
  * Roll toward the Pursuer when he performs an overhead swing to position yourself for immediate counter-attacks.
  * Utilize lightning-based offenses, such as Lightning [Spear](/Spear "Dark Souls 2 Spear") or [Gold Pine Resin](/Gold+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Gold Pine Resin"), to exploit his elemental weaknesses.
  * Parry his charging dash and the initial slashes of his standard combos to create a significant window for attacking, healing, or stamina recovery.
  * Note that his shield bash and blue-glowing "Curse" stab cannot be parried.
  * Inflict poison using 7 to 10 Poison Arrows or through aggressive melee pressure during his spawn animation in locations like the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep").
  * Avoid rolling to the left during his impale attack, as the hitbox can often connect even if the blade appears to miss.
  * Focus on managing stamina by only taking one or two hits between his combos, ensuring you have enough energy to dodge his high-tracking downward smashes.

### Pursuer Notes and Trivia

  * The Pursuer may be a homage to From Software's other series, **Armored Core** , notably, the dual encounter in Drangleic Castle which mirrors the **Nine-Ball** battle in **Armored Core: Master of Arena**.
  * The character's introduction in the Forest of Fallen Giants serves as a potential homage to enemy AC deployment; he is dropped into the arena by a giant bird and enters a hovering stance, mirroring how mechs are deployed by aircraft in the Armored Core missions.
  * The developer **Hiroshima Takatsu** verified that the Pursuer was inspired by the character **Angelo Credo** [](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Credo_DMC4.jpg?v=1524429663015). from **Devil May Cry 4** , specifically regarding their shared sword-and-shield combat styles and gliding maneuvers.
  * The screaming faces embedded in the breastplate of the **Pursuer's armor** are often theorized to be the trapped souls of the Undead he has successfully hunted.
  * While he does not respawn in his primary boss arena at **Cardinal Tower** without a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"), his various miniboss appearances throughout Drangleic are fixed encounters that **cannot be reset** by world-resetting items.
