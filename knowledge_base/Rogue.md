**Hollow Rogue (Rogue)** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.   

  

  

_Dangerous in life as thieves and highwaymen, these Rogues are now doubly so in death, as Hollowing has robbed them of their reason.  
In life, they may have lusted after material wealth, but in death they seek your very Soul._   
  
The undead rogues are figures that wear dark trousers and brown clothing with a hood. Most dual wield fast small weapons while some carry small ranged weapons that fire either arrows or bolts. They often attack in groups. They are found in Huntsman's Copse.
