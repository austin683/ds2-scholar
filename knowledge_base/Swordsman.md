**Swordsman** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki") **is a **[Starting Class](/Starting+Classes "Dark Souls 2 Starting Classes")**. The **Swordsman** is meant for players who prefer low damage but fast mobility. It starts with a [Scimitar](/Scimitar "Dark Souls 2 Scimitar") and a [Shortsword](/Shortsword "Dark Souls 2 Shortsword") as its starting dual-wielded weapons. The [Starting Classes](/Starting+Classes "Dark Souls 2 Starting Classes") of **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki") **will only give you a head start on certain stats. This is because you can freely change your playstyle and build as you progress throughout the game.

**Stats**

  * In the first few levels as a Swordsman, try to boost your Health and Stamina. VGR to 15 and END to 15. Then get your stats for the weapon you want to use. Then push your VGR and END to 20 at which point you CAN leave it if you feel comfortable. Otherwise, increase those two, but it's not worth going more than 20 into END since there is a break-point at which you will only get 1 Stamina for 1 LVL of END. It is also possible to leave VGR aside and go for END and weapon stats but I suggest pushing it to at least 12. At some point, when you get your Black Steel Katanas, for instance, it's wise to spec into some points of Vitality and Adaptability. I keep both of them around 20 but I don't go higher since it's not needed.

### Notes and Tips About Swordsman

Notes: A class for those who like fast attacks with dexterity-based weapons or want to try out dual-wielding. You had better be good at dodging since the Vigor is very low. Needs 8 more DEX and 2 more STR to Power Stance the starting weapons making the dual-wielding abilities more powerful. If you can't power stance yet, you might want to temporarily replace the Shortsword with a shield. You can swap out the right-hand weapon for Rapier to retain the parrying ability upon power stance.
