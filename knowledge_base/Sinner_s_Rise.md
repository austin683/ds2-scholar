### Sinners' Rise Walkthrough

### Getting to Sinners' Rise

From the room that holds [Straid's Cell bonfire](/Straid%27s+Cell "Dark Souls 2 Straid%27s Cell"), the door on the right of it is unlocked using the [Bastille Key](/Bastille+Key "Dark Souls 2 Bastille Key"). In here, you'll find a skeleton with a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"), and 3x [Firebombs](/Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Firebomb"). The door in the cell leads to a hole dropping you down onto the bridge below; you can get to the same bridge from back in the room below [Straid's Cell bonfire](/Straid%27s+Cell "Dark Souls 2 Straid%27s Cell") (at the bottom of the stairs, a pull-lever opens an archway gate to the bridge, which is protected by a bowmen). Just outside this gate and to the right is a short path to a [Royal Soldier](/Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier"), protecting a corpse with 8x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). After killing the soldier, you can sprint across the bridge to the fog gate and kill the [Gaoler](/Gaoler "Dark Souls 2 Gaoler") waiting there. Enter the fog gate to enter **Sinners' Rise**.

### Saltfort Bonfire

Once you proceed through the mist, there may be an archer directly above you, ready to take aim. Quickly rush out the door and up the ladder here, to take care of it mano-a-mano. You may have also noticed the only bonfire in _Sinners' Rise,_ [The Saltfort bonfire](/The+Saltfort "Dark Souls 2 The Saltfort") \- don't worry to much though, this area isn't massive. To the right immediately after you climb the ladder is a doorway with a **very** small ledge which holds a corpse containing a [Large Soul of a Lost Undead](/Large+Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Lost Undead"). 

### Flexile Sentry

From the Bonfire go back down the ladder and continue down the stairs. In the doorway to the left are 3 [Royal Swordsmen](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman"), 2 using a cross-bow. Take them out, then step outside again and move around the edge of the building to find a broken part of the stairs where you find another archer and a corpse with a [Human Effigy,](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") then head back into the building. In the middle of the room you'll find a descending lift. While riding the lift down, keep an eye out for a platform just before you reach the bottom in which you can fall onto, to loot the corpse holding 5x [Lacerating Knife](/Lacerating+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Lacerating Knife") here. From this platform, it is safe enough to jump off to the floor below.

You are now in a dark, water-filled dungeon area. The first enemy you're going to see is a respawning [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry") (as well as 2 [Undead Aberrations](/Undead+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Undead Aberration") in NG+). If you are in Human form, the **NPC** [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah") can be summoned. Her sign is behind the lift you just rode, but it is recommended to save her for the boss fight. Continue through the doorway.

In the alcove on the left is a corpse holding [Blossom Kite Shield](/Blossom+Kite+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Blossom Kite Shield"), while the right alcove may seem empty, located in the left corner of the back wall is a **Hidden Door** accessible by pushing the "use" button. This door leads to outside, and a quite watery death should you move too far forward. Instead, look to your left and hug the wall to reach a corpse holding the [Northern Ritual Band](/Northern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Northern Ritual Band") and a [Bleed Stone](/Bleed+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Bleed Stone")**.** Backtrack to the middle and carry on.

### Finding the Sinner

The alcove on the right has a [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). Continue on and soon you will reach a set of stairs on either side of you, both lead to cells, and a [Rupturing Hollow](/Rupturing+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Rupturing Hollow") waiting on the bottom of the right stairs. There are a total of four cells, two on the ground floor and another two on the upper balconies, as well as a [Rupturing Hollow](/Rupturing+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Rupturing Hollow") on each of the upper balconies. The first left cell on the watery level contains 2 [Rupturing Hollows](/Rupturing+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Rupturing Hollow"), the second cell a corpse with a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros'+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone") and a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight"). In each of the cells on the right, there is a [Rupturing Hollow](/Rupturing+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Rupturing Hollow"). The one on the upper left level, the first door leads to a seemingless empty cell, but when you attack the left corner after entering, you will reveal a hidden corpse with a [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth & Silky Stone"). The second door (which can also be unlocked by the [Bastille Key](/Bastille+Key "Dark Souls 2 Bastille Key")) leads to a resting [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") and a corpse with a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed"). You can kill the [Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") for a [Heide Spear](/Heide+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Heide Spear"), if you wish. The cell on the opposite side contains a [Sellsword Luet](/Sellsword+Luet "Dark Souls 2 Sellsword Luet") summon sign which you could use for the upcoming boss fight. You can now either open one of the doors on the balconies with the [Bastille Key](/Bastille+Key "Dark Souls 2 Bastille Key") or open the middle door on water level with the mechanism on the right of the door. Be sure to take care of all the [Rupturing Hollows](/Rupturing+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Rupturing Hollow") before using the mechanism to lift the gate, otherwise any you did spare will all come flooding in. Once the gate is lifted, a straight path will lead to the boss mist.

Before heading in, turn to the left and follow the narrow path between the stairs to reach a corpse with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). You'll then find two sets of stairs on either side. At the top of both stairs are locked gates (on NG+ there will be a red Mummy in front of each door). Again, if you have the [Bastille Key](/Bastille+Key "Dark Souls 2 Bastille Key") you can open these. In each room you will find a line of oil which you can light with your torch. Lighting both rooms will provide light in the boss area - **highly recommended**. The right hand stairway room holds a [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth %26 Silky Stone").

When you are ready, head to the boss' mist.

### Rounding Up

After defeating the [Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner"), open the door on the opposite side of the room and move down the stairs towards the **Primal Bonfire**. Before entering the room with the bonfire, you will find a chest to your left which holds a [Fragrant Branch Of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+Of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch Of Yore") and an [Elizabeth Mushroom](/Elizabeth+Mushroom "Dark Souls 2 Elizabeth Mushroom"). Be aware that the wall opposite of the chest **isn't** an illusory wall, people may leave countless messages but it isn't. The textures are just weird and ripped. From here light the primal bonfire to warp back to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). The next target is [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman's+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman's Copse").

### Sinners' Rise Walkthrough

### Getting to Sinners' Rise

From the room that holds [Straid's Cell bonfire](/Straid%27s+Cell "Dark Souls 2 Straid%27s Cell"), the door on the right of it is unlocked using the [Bastille Key](/Bastille+Key "Dark Souls 2 Bastille Key"). In here, you'll find a skeleton with a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"), and 3x [Firebombs](/Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Firebomb"). The door in the cell leads to a hole dropping you down onto the bridge below; you can get to the same bridge from back in the room below [Straid's Cell bonfire ](/Straid%27s+Cell "Dark Souls 2 Straid%27s Cell")(at the bottom of the stairs, a pull-lever opens an archway gate to the bridge, which is protected by three bowmen). Just outside this gate and to the right is a short path to a [Royal Soldier](/Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier"), protecting a corpse with 8x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). After killing the soldier, you can sprint across the bridge to the fog gate and kill the [Gaoler](/Gaoler "Dark Souls 2 Gaoler") waiting there. Enter the fog gate to enter **Sinners' Rise**.

### Saltfort Bonfire

Once you proceed through the mist, there'll be multiple archers directly above you, ready to take aim. Quickly rush out the door and up the ladder here, to take care of it mano-a-mano. You may have also noticed the only bonfire in  _Sinners' Rise,_ [The Saltfort bonfire](/The+Saltfort "Dark Souls 2 The Saltfort") \- don't worry to much though, this area isn't massive. To the right immediately after you climb the ladder is a doorway with a **very** small ledge which holds a corpse containing a [Large Soul of a Lost Undead](/Large+Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Lost Undead").

### Undead Aberrations

From the Bonfire go back down the ladder and continue down the stairs, taking out any enemies at the bottom. Before entering the doorway to your left, move around the edge of the building to find a broken part of the stairs, there is a corpse holding a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") there. Proceed into the building to arrive at its ground level. This floor holds a few royal swordsmen/archers. In the middle of the room you'll find a descending lift. While riding the lift down, keep an eye out for a platform just before you reach the bottom in which you can fall onto, to loot the corpse holding 5x [Lacerating Knife](/Lacerating+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Lacerating Knife") here. From this platform, it is safe enough to jump off to the floor below.

You are now in a dark, water-filled dungeon area. If you are in Human form, the **NPC** [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah") can be summoned. Her sign is behind the lift you just rode. There are a total of 3 [Undead Aberrations](/Undead+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Undead Aberration") (huge, malformed, dragon-esque creatures), so here are a few tips and notes on these enemies in the area:

  * Block their attacks and counter only when safe.
  * An easy way to kill these Giants is to send the elevator back up after riding it down, opening a hole in the floor. The lure the Giants into the room one at a time. If you stand close to the hole in the floor, you can let the Giants get close enough to attack, then as they're attacking run to the opposite side of the hole. 
    * Most of the time, the attack or the pursuit after the attack will cause the Giant to fall into the hole and die. Just be careful not to fall into the hole yourself.
  * Another easy way would be to lure the giants near the elevator platform, keep your shield up and strafe towards and away the giant. Eventually he will roll towards you and onto the platform, run up and step on the pressure plate to send him upwards. On his way up he will try to jump and nearly die landing on the walkway above you. He can't get down from here so either leave him or shoot him with a few arrows.
  * Surprisingly enough this enemy can be back-stabbed.

The first one will come in from the left, as soon as you pass the doorway. In the alcove the first came from is a corpse holding [Sublime Bone Dust](/Sublime+Bone+Dust "Dark Souls 2 Sublime Bone Dust"). On the alcove on the right enter the empty alcove where another [Undead Aberration](/Undead+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Undead Aberration") can break through one of these walls, so proceed with caution _._ Located in the left corner of the back wall is a **Hidden Door** accessible by pressing the "use" button. This door leads to outside, and a quite watery death should you move too far forward. Instead, look to your left and hug the wall to reach a corpse holding the [Northern Ritual Band](/Northern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Northern Ritual Band") and a [Bleed Stone](/Bleed+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Bleed Stone").

### Finding the Sinner

Returning from the alcove continue on and watch both ways for the last [Undead Aberrations](/Undead+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Undead Aberration"). The alcove on the right has a [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). Continue on and soon you will reach a set of stairs on either side of you, both lead to cells. There are a total of four cells, two on the ground floor and another two on the upper balconies. The second left cell on the watery level contains a corpse with a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros'+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone") and a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight"). The one on the upper left level, second door (which can also be unlocked by the [Bastille Key](/Bastille+Key "Dark Souls 2 Bastille Key")) leads to a corpse with a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed"). You can kill the [Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") for a [Heide Spear](/Heide+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Heide Spear"), if you wish. The cell on the opposite side contains another [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed"). Be sure to take care of all the [Rupturing Hollows](/Rupturing+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Rupturing Hollow") before using the mechanism to lift the gate, otherwise any mummies you did spare will all come flooding in. Once the gate is lifted, a straight path will lead to the boss mist.

Before heading in, turn to the left and follow the narrow path between the stairs to reach a corpse with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). You'll then find two sets of stairs on either side. At the top of both stairs are locked gates (on NG+ there will be a red Mummy in front of each door). Again, if you have the [Bastille Key](/Bastille+Key "Dark Souls 2 Bastille Key") you can open these. In each room you will find a line of oil which you can light with your torch. Lighting both rooms will provide light in the boss area - **highly recommended.** The right hand stairway room holds a [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth %26 Silky Stone").

When you are ready, head to the boss' mist.

After defeating the [Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner"), open the door on the opposite side of the room and move down the stairs towards the **Primal Bonfire**.

Be aware that the wall opposite of the chest isn't an illusory wall, people may leave countless messages but it isn't. The textures are just weird and ripped. From here light the primal bonfire to warp back to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula").
