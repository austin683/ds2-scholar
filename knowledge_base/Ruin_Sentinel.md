### Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel Information

Ruin Sentinels are bosses and endgame enemies later encountered in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") in Dark Souls 2. Very tall and lithe, the Ruin Sentinel is armored from head to toe in what looks to be bronze. It has a narrow helmet slit, giving it a something of a robot-like appearance. These enemies are extremely fast for their size, and come at the player with a variety of attacks, many notable for their wide hit potential. There are three named Ruin Sentinels, Alessia, Ricce, and Yahim, who make up the the boss fight in the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"): three Sentinels fought in a room: one on the platform near the entrance, and two below on the ground.

### Ruin Sentinel Move Set
    
    
    | Attack | Description | Countermeasures |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Horizontal Swing | Grips their weapon with two hands and performs one clean horizontal swipe. This attack is telegraphed by the Sentinel bringing its weapon behind to its right (player's left) like a golf club, and has a moderate delay prior to swinging. | Can be avoided by retreating away, or dodged by rolling through towards the left, but deals heavy damage if it hits, and causes minor recoil even if successfully blocked, temporarily immobilizing the player. Has a moderate recovery time after execution. |
    | Diagonal Swipes | Swings its weapon diagonally twice in a row, from left to right (player's perspective) and then in the reverse direction. Can be dodged by rolling through. | Has poor tracking beyond the first swipe, so dodging behind the Sentinel during the first swing will cause the second to miss entirely, giving the player an opportunity to inflict damage. Blocking with a greatshield will cause either swipe to deflect, staggering the Sentinel but allowing it to act almost immediately afterward, negating any recovery time. |
    | Thrust & Swing | Brings the weapon back slightly, pointed forward, and then thrusts forward toward the player, followed by a step forward with a horizontal swipe left to right (player's perspective) after a short delay. | The thrust can be sidestepped to the right or rolled to avoid, and like the Double Swipe above has poor tracking so escaping the Sentinel's forward arc after the thrust and standing behind it will cause the follow-up to miss. Beware that as the Ruin Sentinel takes a step forward for the swipe, it has more range and can catch players who decide to retreat backwards to avoid the attack. |
    | Overhead Slam | Telegraphed by the Sentinel gripping its weapon with both hands before it performs an overhead slam. | This attack has a narrow hitbox, however it has good tracking so rolling may be necessary, as walking or running to the side may not be fast enough to dodge the attack. Has a relatively long recovery time that can be taken advantage of. |
    | Shield Toss | Performed only by the Ruin Sentinels in the Lost Bastille. When outside of attack range, the Sentinel throws its shield, causing it to fly vertically towards its target. | The shield can be dodged by rolling to the side, or deflected by rolling into it. The shield embeds itself in a wall behind its target, and the Sentinel does not retrieve it afterward, preventing it from blocking attacks anymore. |
    | Spin | If the Sentinel is not within attack range of the player, they may crouch down slightly and bring their weapon out to their side, and then spin around counter-clockwise four times while traveling towards the player. | As the attack has a long travel distance, the best way to avoid this is to retreat far enough away or try to dodge to the side of its path. Blocking all of the damage instances is not recommended, as it can drain large amounts of stamina, leaving the player vulnerable to attacks by any other Sentinels. / If the player is confident, the attack can also be dodged by dodging directly into the sentinel as it begins the first spin, then dodging out and past it immediately after. |
    | Running Lunge | Performed only by the Ruin Sentinels in the Lost Bastille. If there is a fair amount of distance between the player and the Sentinel, they may run at the player and perform a two-handed thrust attack. | It is recommended to try to dodge to the side against this attack, as their forward momentum gives them very good reach which can catch players who try to back away. This attack deals a moderate amount of damage, but leaves the Sentinel vulnerable to follow-up. |
    | Leaping Slam | Telegraphed by the Sentinel crouching down slightly and then performing a leap toward the player. | Can be dodged by running or rolling to the side, and has a long recovery time that allows players to freely inflict damage on the Sentinel. / Be aware that this attack has two different timings: Instant and Delayed. If the Sentinel simply leaps up slightly, the player should dodge immediately. If the Sentinel leaves the player’s screen, then the player should count to two before dodging. Both attacks have a thin hitbox, so rolling forwards or sideways is recommended. |
    

### Ruin Sentinel Strategies

**GENERAL ADVICE**

The Ruin Sentinels are extremely weak to both Blunt and Lightning damage. If you have any blunt weapon at your disposal (the Craftsman's Hammer from the chest under McDuff, for example, or the Mace from Blacksmith Leningrast), enchanting your weapon with Sunlight Weapon, infusing it with Lightning or simply using Gold Pine Resin will give you a lot of extra damage so you can dispatch them with ease.

You can parry all the Sentinel's attacks, but for the jump attacks and spin attack, they will not be stunned, and if you parry the jump attacks, there is NO SOUND, and for the spin attack, the Sentinel's next spins in the attack will not do any damage.

Despite being stated to be golems in lore, the Sentinels are easily poisonable in game. 

The fight starts on a platform with one of the sentinels; the sentinel will immediately attack with an overhead attack, so rolling or running sideways (risky due to hitbox) is ideal to avoid the attack and punish the sentinel. Fighting him requires patience, and baiting his overhead smash is the safest method to dodge and punish--be wary of the camera and side way attacks. Then the second one will try to approach the platform; standing on the ledge will bait him into doing his jumping attack, and the player can back off to the wall behind to avoid it and punish it. **It is highly suggested that players immediately capitalize on that and try to chip him before the other one attacks.** After hitting the second sentinel twice, the player should jump off to avoid fighting them on the same ledge. The following part is the most challenging: fighting two at the same time. The key to fighting two opponents, generally, is staying in front of them and forcing them to not use dangerous long ranged attacks, and to make them attack and stay in recovery frames so that the player can punish them safely without getting hit, had the other one tried to attack the player while punishing the first opponents  
  
Easiest Way: Just prior to the grey mist, there is a spirit to summon in one of the cells containing a skeleton, which makes this fight significantly easier, as she casts Greater Soul Arrow repeatedly. After your destroy the first one, jump down and have one person tank the second one while 2 people attack the third one. If you can use lightning spells/weapons/weapon enhancements, use them because they are weak to lightning. Or simply kite the remaining two around while the spirit chips away at them, as with enough room and warning, avoiding the sentinels attacks is straightforward.   
  
**Bellclaire does all the work** : Safe Requirements: Enough STR to two-hand a 100% physical block shield (8 for Drangleic Shield), summoning Pilgrim Bellclaire. Equip the Drangleic Sheild (or a 100% physical block shield, Drangleic is just the easiest to obtain along the way), and two-hand it. Enter the boss fog, block the first Sentinels attack, and then sit in a corner while blocking (lowering your block in between attacks, to regain stamina). Bellclaire will do her thing and blast the first Sentinel until it's dead.When the next two sentinels come down, jump down as well and simply do the same thing: get their attention, sit in the corner with your shield up, block the hits, and lower guard between attacks. You should be able to guard everything they throw at you. If they stamina break you, they both probably just attacked and will take a bit to prep themselves, giving you time to regenerate all your stamina. Bellclaire will get in range and start doing her thing, taking both sentinels down.This has worked flawlessly on many characters, usually involving taking 0 damage (except for fall damage). I have tested this with a Large Leather Shield (90% phys dmg, 40 stability), and lost about 800 health in total during the fight, so it can be done with a lighter shield. Just watch your health and heal when safe (after first sentinel/falling, and after a second sentinel dies).   
  
**Notes** :

  * Their lunging air attack leaves them quite open, however, dodging them early the moment they jump is advisable.
  * Use a fast weapon with small recovery e.g dagger, short sword, long sword, scimitar.

#### Greatshield Strategy

If you acquired the [Tower Shield](/Tower+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Tower Shield") from [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue"), a useful strategy for anyone with at least 15 STR is to 2-hand the shield and let the summonable NPC fight the Sentinels while you tank all of their hits. Since they only deal in physical attacks as long as you manage your stamina well you should be able to go the whole fight without taking damage as the shield has 100% physical block and high stability. If you lose aggro on any of the sentinels simply hit them with the shield until their focus turns to you.   
  

#### Dark Hail Strategy

If you acquired [Dark Hail](/Dark+Hail "Dark Souls 2 Dark Hail"), Dark [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff") +5 and having at least 50 Intelligence and faith or above (both), it is possible to stagger within 3 blasts provided if all orbs hit the sentinel since each sentinel is counted as large enemies rather than huge bosses, [Stone Ring](/Stone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Stone Ring") and [Abyss Seal](/Abyss+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Abyss Seal") may also help. however, it may only work at early NG to NG+2 (tested in Drangleic Castle encounter)   
  

#### Craftsman's Hammer Strategy

The [Craftsman's Hammer](/Craftsman%27s+Hammer "Dark Souls 2 Craftsman%27s Hammer"), which can be found in McDuff's area, is extremely effective against the ruin sentinels. Whether this is for all blunt weapons needs to be tested and confirmed. The use of this hammer and a 100% physical shield is dreadfully effective against the sentinels and allows for this to be a solo fight.   
  

#### Drakewing Ultra Greatsword Strategy

Two handed strong attack executed from [Drakewing Ultra Greatsword](/Drakewing+Ultra+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Drakewing Ultra Greatsword") buffed with Dark Pine Resin can stagger Ruin Sentinels effortlessly.   
  

#### Dual Malformed Skull Strategy

Powerstance strong attack executed with dual Raw [Malformed Skulls](/Malformed+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Malformed Skull") can also stagger Ruin Sentinels effortlessly.

### Notes

  * The Sentinels in Drangleic Castle have less attacks than the ones in the Lost Bastille.
  * If the player is a member of the Company of Champions covenant, they cannot summon the NPC mage to aid them in the fight; the summon sign will simply not appear. Abandoning the covenant will allow the summon sign to appear. See [Online](/Online "Dark Souls 2 Online")page for details.
  * Any of the three have a chance to randomly switch targets before a long range leaping attack. New target does not have to be causing damage or aggro. Keep this in mind when healing. (Needs confirmation)
  * There are _5 (4 on the first floor and 1 on the second, which is accessible from the room containing the ladder)_ [illusory walls](/Illusory+Wall "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Wall") in the boss area, pressing X on PS3 or A on XBox 360 will reveal it: 1xTarget shield, 1x hush, 1x Rusted coin
  * Another strategy is to enchant a fast weapon with poison and get in some hits until the poison sets in. Since they have low health individually, you can play the defensive until the poison does its work.
  * This boss can be **skipped** if it's hard for newer players, but it is suggested that new players at least try to fight Ruin Sentinels before attempting this skip as they will encounter them again later. It requires defeating the Pursuer at Forest of Fallen Giants, Flexible Sentry at No Man's Wharf, and a Pharro's Lockstone. After defeating the Pursuer, take the bird's next to Lost Bastille. At Lost Bastille, take a left and follow the path until you obtain an Antiquated Key. Use the bonfire to travel to Lost Bastille's first bonfire. Head to the area where the two dogs are, passed the Heide Knight, and hit the planks on your right. Go through the locked door and follow this path until you come to an area with two chests. There will be a Pharro's Lockstone insertion on the wall right at the entrance on the right. Use it, hit the walls, and there should be an elevator (looks like a cage that you need to step inside) to reach to the top of Lost Bastille. This will send you to the area after the Ruin Sentinels fight. **Make sure to get the Servant's Quarter's bonfire by heading downwards**.
  * **Scholar of the First Sin:** To encounter this boss, a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") is required.
