### Traveling Merchant Gloves Description

_"Gauntlets worn by merchants from Lanafir, where blue represents knowledge. Wearing this increases item discovery._  
_Lanafir is the farthest land to the south and follows a strict edict of isolationism. The rare visitor from Lanafir is always a little odd."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia) by the Cardinal Tower bonfire in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants), or in [Majula](/Majula) when dialogue is exhausted

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore).
  * Hat raises item discovery when worn.*edit* Note: The hat raises item discovery by a CONSIDERABLE amount, this hat is definitely worth using all-game,whilst getting the defensive stats you need from other pieces.
