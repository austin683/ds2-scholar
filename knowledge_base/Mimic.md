**Mimic** is a **[Trap](/Traps "Dark Souls 2 Traps") **that becomes an **[Enemy](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies")** in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**.** Traps are usually unexpected hazards that players can run into since they are intended to be concealed, hidden or disguised. Many traps have different effects when activated. These Mimic Chests are laid out in plain sight and can be encountered as you play through DS2 as well. They are disguised as regular loot chests but transform into a Mimic enemy when interacted with. Unlike some other traps, they have a distinguishable feature on them that allows players to tell them apart. Before interacting with chests, take look for a large pad lock at the opening and avoid standing in the front if you wish to confront the Mimic. 

> A monster which looks like (mimics) a regular chest but will attack the player when opened or struck. The mimic will gobble up any player standing close to it, a move which deals high damage and can kill a player outright.

### Mimic Information DS2

Like the mimics of Dark Souls 1, these mimics are fairly easy to discern from regular chests. Wooden mimics have a small face-like ornament on their clasp. Black metal mimics have two clasps that ordinary chests do not have. Furthermore, if one moves their view to place a chest between the camera and their character, a normal chest will block it as if panning into a wall, while a mimic will not. If you angle your camera close to the ground so it zooms in on the front of the chest, mimic chest lids are slightly open which allows you to see the teeth. They do not seem to occasionally breathe the way the mimics did in DS1, but a Lloyd's Talisman will still disable them and make them offer their items without a fight.  
  
Both types of chests, metal and wooden, can be struck as a means of checking for mimicry. One must be careful however, not overdo it. If a player inadvertently destroys the chest when checking for a mimic (happens if you strike the chest 3 times), they will be left with [Rubbish](/Rubbish "Dark Souls 2 Rubbish").

### Mimic DS2 Strategy Tips

**Move set**

  * Two Handed Sword Attack
  * Running Attack
  * Acid Spit

Counter Strategy

  * The easiest way to handle a mimic is to hit them several times while they are unfurling. If you have a fairly well upgraded weapon, they won't survive long.
  * After about 4-5 seconds they will lash out and grab anything in a moderately large range around them, probably leading to death. Once they are fully open, they have a number of leaping or gap-closing attacks, as well as a round kick. Their defense remains weak however, and their counter-window is seemingly quite large, making the [Old Leo Ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring") very useful with the proper weapon. Both in front of it and behind it are unsafe, so hug its side to attack and then evade.
  * Using a [Lloyd's Talisman](/Lloyd%27s+Talisman "Dark Souls 2 Lloyd%27s Talisman") on a mimic will disable it for easy killing or taking its drops without a fight, though leaving mimics alive is fairly pointless now that mimics have no random drop items like the [Symbol of Avarice](/Symbol+of+Avarice "Dark Souls 2 Symbol of Avarice").
  * Using the pyromancies [Poison Mist](/Poison+Mist "Dark Souls 2 Poison Mist") or [Toxic Mist](/Toxic+Mist "Dark Souls 2 Toxic Mist") will let you damage a mimic without causing it to aggro. This also works if you are unsure a chest is a mimic, because it will not destroy a regular chest's contents.
  * Mimics will not respond to damage caused by poison. Using the [Moon Butterfly Set](/Moon+Butterfly+Set "Dark Souls 2 Moon Butterfly Set") will poison the mimic to death without any aggro.zz
