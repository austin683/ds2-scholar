### DS2 Stone Ring Tips and Notes

  * It also affects all spells (tested with Lightning Spear vs Sanctum Soldier, who as a result got staggered by each LS instead of each 2nd cast. Didn't test pyromancies or hexes, but I can only assume that it's global, no reason for it not to be). This is due to a previous patch that reduced the poise damage of Sorceries, so this ring is a means of getting that poise damage back (which means you need to wear this ring if you want the same effect you had before the Sorceries got nerfed in this regard).
