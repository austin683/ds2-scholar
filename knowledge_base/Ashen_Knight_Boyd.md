### Ashen Knight Boyd Information in Dark Souls 2

  * Ashen Knight Boyd is a [Royal Soldier](/Royal+Soldier+Set "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier Set"), much like [Masterless Glencour](/Masterless+Glencour "Dark Souls 2 Masterless Glencour").
  * Good at distracting [Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja") during the boss fight as well as dealing a good chunk of damage, provided he does not hit her shell. Also very useful for taking care of the spiders.
  * Unlike most other royal soldiers encountered, Boyd wields an Estoc, instead of the usual shield and spear. 
  * Is capable of healing himself but not a huge amount (It heals just as the Estus, but significantly weaker)
  * Glitch: When summoning him for the fight against Freja, he runs to you right away rather than starting from the "standing up" animation the moment he spawns as a summon. 
  * In SotFS: When summoned against the Looking Glass Knight, he seems to take advantage of the Estoc's shield piercing ability when attacking the shield-side of the Looking Glass Knight and can also sometimes instantly attacks and even backstabs recently-spawned player Mirror Squires, especially while they are still stuck waiting for the loading screen to finish
