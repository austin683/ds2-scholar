I'm a reliable summon for all bosses besides Freja (still working on mastering that fight, but I'm still fully capable of providing tons of support). Old Iron King is a popular spot for coop, as a lot of players have trouble with that fight. I'm the person to help you with that fight as I've beaten them numerous times with no armor, fists only, and no Vanquisher's Seal up to an NG+7 level. / As for duels/fight clubs: I'm uninterested in parry spammers, healers, and backstab fishers. I also dread Ironclad tops, Jester tops, and Gower's Rings, but I won't refuse a battle to any of those as they're items with disadvantages that can be worked around. / Message me on XBL if you're looking for a fellow player who likes having fun with the game. / P.S. - I trade Great Hero Souls, Large Souls, Souls of Proud Knights, etcetera for human effigies :) |  |  |  |  |
