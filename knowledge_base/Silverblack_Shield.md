**Silverblack Shield** is a [standard shield](/standard+shields "Dark Souls 2 standard shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A silver-black shield imbued with the power of dark._

     _The equipment of the wardens of the Undead Crypt are soaked in its darkness, and permeated by its power.  
The grave wardens are said to know the name of every guest who rests in the crypt, no matter how long they have been with them."_

  

### Acquired From:

  * Drops from [Grave Wardens](/Grave+Warden "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden") in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") and [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt")

### Silverblack Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Respectable damage reductions across the board.
  * Dark dedicated shield, when infused with dark it provides a good Dark defense in terms of early shield, only to be surpassed by [Transgressor's Leather Shield](/Transgressor%27s+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Transgressor%27s Leather Shield").
  * Alternatively, when infused with lightning, it boosts better overall magic defenses than the [Drakekeeper's Shield](/Drakekeepers+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeepers Shield").
