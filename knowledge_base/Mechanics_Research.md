# Drop Rate

Someone on the forums had claimed that there's no extensive test of drop rate and item stacking (there wouldn't be a need for one, had FROM not decided to hide drop rate / luck / [item discovery](/Item+Discovery "Dark Souls 2 Item Discovery") stat in this particular installment of the series). Here's one attempt to fill the void. This is one anecdotal test conducted by a player, and since 2016 there has been more to show that it has its inaccuracies.

### Test Conditions

  * Cycle: NG
  * Area: [The Old Chaos](/Old+Chaos "Dark Souls 2 Old Chaos") (fresh after boss)
  * Enemy: [Charred Loyce Knight](/Charred+Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Knight")
  * Number of enemies per run: 3
  * Number of runs until saves are reloaded / loot table refreshed: 16 *1
  * Total number of runs per any set of items: 64 (numbers are averaged from 4 x16 runs) *2
  * Total number of kills per any set of items: 192 *2
  * Bonfire is used every time *3
  * [Rusted Coins](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin") are consumed before bonfire is used
  * Humanity is restored on death *3, next kill counted (with multiple deaths, total number of souls is used as reference)
  * Approximate number of souls (start–end): 100k–238k (242k with [Symbol of Avarice](/Symbol+of+Avarice "Dark Souls 2 Symbol of Avarice"))
  * Soul Level: 229
  * Soul Memory: 8,1–8,2M
  * No covenants *3
  * Patch: Version 1,02 / Calibration 2,02

#### Notes

  1. Base values for single items are tested 3 x64 times, values for pairs and modifiers are tested 2 x64 times. Any weird numbers are re-tested 2 x64 times for consistency.
  2. See "modifiers".

### Discovery Boosting Items

  * Ring: CGSR = [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring") +2
  * Helmets 
    * JSC = [Jester's Cap](/Jester's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Jester's Set")
    * PHD = [Prisoner's Hood](/Prisoner's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner's Set")
    * SoA = [Symbol of Avarice](/Symbol+of+Avarice "Dark Souls 2 Symbol of Avarice")
    * TMH = [Traveling Merchant Hat](/Traveling+Merchant+Set "Dark Souls 2 Traveling Merchant Set")
  * Armor: PTT = [Prisoner's Tatters](/Prisoner's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner's Set")
  * Shield: WDP = [Watchdragon Parma](/Watchdragon+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Watchdragon Parma")
  * Consumable: RC = [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin")

### Loot

  * S = [Loyce Soul](/Loyce+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Soul")
  * H = [Charred Loyce Helm](/Charred+Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Set")
  * C = [Charred Loyce Armor](/Charred+Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Set") (chestpiece)
  * G = [Charred Loyce Gauntlets](/Charred+Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Set")
  * B = [Charred Loyce Leggings](/Charred+Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Set") (boots)
  * Sh = [Charred Loyce Shield](/Charred+Loyce+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Shield")
  * Sw = [Charred Loyce Greatsword](/Charred+Loyce+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Greatsword")

### Numbers

#### No items or 1 item / modifiers

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Drop_Rate_1.png)

#### Effect of modifiers on each item

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Drop_Rate_mod.png)

#### Combinations of 2 items

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Drop_Rate_2.png)

#### Combinations of 3 items

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Drop_Rate_3.png)

#### Combinations of 4 items

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Drop_Rate_4.png)

#### Combinations of 5 items

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Drop_Rate_5.png)

#### Notes

  * If no items of certain type drop in 64 runs, 1 is taken from the maximum number (total number is kept).
  * [Rusted Coins](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin") do not stack. On the contrary, using more than one coin often lowers drop rate. (Note: coin's effect is reset on fast-travel.)
  * No bonfire runs: in case of death souls are picked up, then [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") is used at once and next run is counted.
  * Modified runs: green highlight = better results, blue = worse. All such numbers are tested 4 x64 times in total.
  * Combinations of 3 items: numbers highlighted in red are unusually high for how items stack / override each other in pairs.
  * Numbers in each set of 16 runs vary up to ±4 from median, so anything within that range is seen as lack of further improvement ("> override").
  * Numbers for individual loot items don't seem to have any connection with certain luck-modifying items and vary up to ±10 from median.

#### Conclusion

  * [Prisoner's Hood and Tatters](/Prisoner's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner's Set") only combine with each other and still yield numbers lower than most single items.
  * [Traveling Merchant Hat](/Traveling+Merchant+Set "Dark Souls 2 Traveling Merchant Set") doesn't seem to combine with any other item in pairs, but somehow produces a spike in drop rate when used in triplets along with [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring") +2 and [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin").
  * [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring") +2 combines with [Jester's Cap](/Jester's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Jester's Set"), [Watchdragon Parma](/Watchdragon+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Watchdragon Parma") and [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin"), but results are only slightly better than with single items.
  * [Symbol of Avarice](/Symbol+of+Avarice "Dark Souls 2 Symbol of Avarice") performs best among single items and combines with most other items, often resulting in the highest numbers. Coupled with [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin"), it forms the base for the best combinations.
  * Using 5 items at once makes little sense as some items override each other – the same or even better result can be achieved with 4 items.
  * In short, best options are: 
    * 1 item: WDP < CGSR < RC < SoA
    * 2 items: CGSR + JSC/RC < SoA + WDP/RC
    * 3 items: CGSR + WDP + JSC/RC < CGSR + TMH + RC (somehow) / CGSR + WDP + SoA
    * 4 items: CGSR + WDP + RC + JSC/SoA
  * Numbers are given for certain loot pool, but it doesn't mean they cannot be applied to other loot; it's **item discovery** and **stacking power** described here, not the chance of obtaining certain item. The chance gets higher with items and combinations that yield higher numbers, that's for sure.

# Effectiveness of dark catalysts

The following bit of research might prove useful to those who play as (dumb) warriors with little knowledge of magic. Among the spells with low stat requirements, [Dark Orb](/Dark+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Dark Orb") seems to be the best option: decent damage (or even high against some enemies, compared to damage dealt with fire and magic arrows) and high number of casts (20 by default), plus some stun power against humanoid enemies.

### Test conditions

  * Cycle: NG+2
  * Upgrade: full (+5/+10)
  * Infusion: Dark
  * Stats: minimal stat requirements are met
  * Area: [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") – Crestfallen's Retreat
  * Enemy: [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre")
  * Patch: Version 1,02 / Calibration 2,02

### Numbers

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Dark_catalysts.png)

Notes

  * Effectiveness is expressed simply as a product of damage and casting speed.
  * [Sorcerer's Twinblade](/Sorcerer's+Twinblade "Dark Souls 2 Sorcerer's Twinblade") cannot be used to cast [Dark Orb](/Dark+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Dark Orb") even though spell icon is not dimmed with this catalyst equipped.
  * * No infusion is available for [Azal's Staff](/Azal%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Azal%27s Staff").
  * ** [Azal's Staff](/Azal%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Azal%27s Staff") limits the number of spell casts to ~25%.

### Analysis

  * [Azal's Staff](/Azal%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Azal%27s Staff"), despite dealing the highest single-shot damage, has the lowest effectiveness due to lowest possible casting speed. Remember about drastically limited number of spell casts and see that this staff is only fit for quickly killing a single target. Also, it has high stat requirements (35+18) and is found rather late in [Ivory King DLC](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King").
  * [Black Witch's Staff](/Black+Witch%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch%27s Staff") and [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff") both have equally high effectiveness and are equal in combined stat requirements as well (20+20 vs 22+18). [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff") offers higher single-shot damage while [Black Witch's Staff](/Black+Witch%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch%27s Staff") has higher casting speed. Both staves are available early, though [Black Witch's Staff](/Black+Witch%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch%27s Staff") requires fighting a nasty invader in [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter") and is NOT a guaranteed drop. One more thing: [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff") is upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"), so it's only a viable option for late game.
  * [Sorcerer's Staff](/Sorcerer%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sorcerer%27s Staff") is available almost at once ([Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") – Cardinal Tower) and has very low stat requirement (10 INT), but given its moderate effectiveness, it's better not to spend upgrade materials on it and obtain [Witchtree Branch](/Witchtree+Branch "Dark Souls 2 Witchtree Branch") instead, which has the highest effectiveness and casting speed (with moderate single-shot damage), low stat requirement (16 INT) and is available rather early ([Majula pit](/The+Pit "Dark Souls 2 The Pit") > [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") > [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter") > [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch") – [Forgotten Key](/Forgotten+Key "Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Key") > [Majula pit](/The+Pit "Dark Souls 2 The Pit") again) with only one minor boss fight on the way.
  * Once again, even though tested on a certain enemy, results can be used as reference in any fight – with damage numbers being lower or higher, relative power (catalyst "a" > catalyst "b") will remain the same.

# Effectiveness of bows and greatbows

How to tell which bow performs better? How to tell if a bow is worth the effort of developing certain stats and using upgrade materials? I didn't know, so I had to check. See the results below.

### Test conditions

  * Cycle: NG+
  * Upgrade: full (+5/+10)
  * Infusion: none
  * Stats: STR 40*, DXT 50, FTH 18** / END 60 (160 Stamina Points)
  * Area: 
    * Test 1: [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") – Threshold Bridge
    * Test 2: [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") – Crestfallen's Retreat
  * Enemy: 
    * Test 1: dark spirit [Alonne Knight Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") (forge)
    * Test 2: [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre")
  * Patch: Version 1,02 / Calibration 2,02

#### Notes

  * Effectiveness is expressed as a product of damage dealt per second (single-shot damage / fire rate in seconds) and arrows fired per given amount of stamina (total stamina / stamina consumption per shot).
  * Maximum damage is used for EFC calculation.
  * Stamina consumption per shot is measured with a ruler applied to the screen.
  * [Short Bow](/Short+Bow "Dark Souls 2 Short Bow") is not included because it's inferior to other bows (same idea with wooden arrows), but mostly because I kinda forgot about it and then was too lazy to redo the test. Maybe I'll update the numbers when I get back to the game, but not anytime soon.
  * * STR 45 for [Twin-Headed Greatbow](/Twin-Headed+Greatbow "Dark Souls 2 Twin-Headed Greatbow").
  * ** Only for [Bow of Want](/Bow+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Bow of Want").

### Numbers

#### Test 1

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Bows_Greatbows_1)

#### Test 2

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Bows_Greatbows_2)

### Analysis

  * Among regular bows, [Bow of Want](/Bow+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Bow of Want") shows the best results in both single-shot damage and overall effectiveness. Following closely in terms of damage, [Dragonrider Bow](/Dragonrider+Bow "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider Bow") is only half as effective due to lower rate of fire and higher stamina consumption. It's also heavier and has shorter range (35 vs 50-60 of other bows).
  * Among greatbows, [Alonne Greatbow](/Alonne+Greatbow "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Greatbow") is the most effective and the most lightweight (but still 4 times heavier than most regular bows) with damage ~20% lower compared to the most damaging [Twin-Headed Greatbow](/Twin-Headed+Greatbow "Dark Souls 2 Twin-Headed Greatbow"), which, in turn, falls far behind in effectiveness due to extremely low fire rate (one arrow in 5 seconds) and is two times heavier.
  * In cross-category comparison, [Bow of Want](/Bow+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Bow of Want") outperforms both regular and greatbows while offering fastest firing speed and single-shot damage that is only 13–30% lower (that needs more testing) compared to the best greatbows.
  * All in all, greatbows have the advantage of stun/push effect, but are heavy, slow and use insane amounts of stamina (only one arrow fired at full power).
