  * _"Colossal warriors staunchly watch over the shrine, ready to defend its resident, or allow one worth enough to be granted audience."_

###  Acquired From

  * [Drakekeepers](/Drakekeeper) armed with a sword and shield at the [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine).

###  Hints and Tips:

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/titanite) to +10.
  * When fully upgraded, it's superior to unupgraded [Defender's Shield](/Defender%27s+Shield) and [Bone Shield](/Bone+Shield).
  * When infused with dark, it gains the best defenses for medium shields across the board at the cost of losing 100% physical damage reduction.
  * Since [patch 1.15](/patches), the weight has been increased from 6.0 to 7.0 and the durability from 80 to 110. It is less viable for a light build compared to [Defender's Shield](/Defender%27s+Shield). It is also harder to farm as there is only ONE sword and shield [Drakekeepers](/Drakekeeper) in the whole game (SotFS).
