### How to get Black Dragon Sword in Dark Souls 2

  * Very rare drop from [Black Dragon Knight](/Black+Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Knight") in [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine"). Only the one wielding the sword at the very top of the stairs will drop the sword. In SOTFS the Black Dragon Knight at the bottom of the spiral stair case before the dragon egg drops it as well.
  * **Very Rare!** Use all luck increasing items such as the [Jester's Hat](/Jester%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Jester%27s Set"), [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring") and  [Rusted Coins](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin").

  * Upgraded with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5.
