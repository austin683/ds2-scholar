### Shadow Gauntlets Description

_"Used to hide in the cover of night. Those who are especially adept assassins are often hired as bodyguards._  
_In an attempt to stave off the curse, King Vendrick hired shadowmen to put down the Hollows, but before long they were Hollowed themselves"_

### Location

  * Drop from Suspicious Shadow (NG+) or with the use of a Bonfire Ascetic at the No Man's Wharf bonfire.
  * 2 shadows appear with the boss. Drop rate is "Rare" even with stacked item discovery and rusted coins.

### 

### Notes

    * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
    * Gauntlets need 16 Dex to use.
    * Increases bleed attack: 
      * Adds 25 to bleed attack if a weapon is infused with bleed using a bleed stone.
      * Adds 50 to bleed attack if weapon has bleed damage innately.
      * Adds 60 to bleed attack if weapon has bleed damage innately **and** is infused with bleed using a bleed stone.
      * Possibly adds 37.5 to bleed attack if weapon has bleed damage but a **non-bleed** infusion.
      * These rules may not be true for all weapons, needs further testing.
    * Stacks with [Crest of Blood](/Crest+of+Blood "Dark Souls 2 Crest of Blood").
