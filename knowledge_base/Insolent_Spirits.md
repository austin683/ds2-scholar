_[Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") >> [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt")_   
  
_Description (Spawn-Information from the Dark Souls fandom page, since the info here was outdated)_

Found in several areas within the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") after lighting a certain hidden brazier. From the Undead Ditch bonfire, make way to the shortcut bridge that lies along the path toward [Velstadt's](/Velstadt,+the+Royal+Aegis "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt, the Royal Aegis") room. Drop to a platform barely visible below ([Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") recommended) and light the brazier found there. A whole party of Insolents will then spawn throughout several rooms within the whole stage.

  * A total of eleven Insolents will appear:

    1. Right behind the brazier used to summon them. Intended to take the player by surprise from behind.
    2. Up the ladder in the first graveyard which leads to a [Leydia Witch](/Leydia+Witch "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Witch") guarding the second one.
    3. In the next room after the second graveyard.
    4. Inside a hidden room with a metal chest. From the main hall, enter the third graveyard and interact with the left wall to reveal a [Pharros' Contraption](/Pharros'+Contraption "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Contraption"). Activate it and another wall will open directly on the opposite side. The Insolent can be found hidden inside.
    5. In the main hall, right outside the first graveyard and to the right.
    6. In the lower level right after exiting [Agdayne's](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne") lair. Can be lured to the upper floors with ranged attacks.
    7. Near the entrance to the hall that leads to [Velstadt's](/Velstadt,+the+Royal+Aegis "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt, the Royal Aegis") room.
    8. In the hall that leads to [Velstadt's](/Velstadt,+the+Royal+Aegis "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt, the Royal Aegis") room, hidden behind the series of mausoleums on the left.
    9. Near the far end of the room with two [Leydia Witch](/Leydia+Witch "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Witch")es and several [Undead Laborer](/Undead+Laborer "Dark Souls 2 Undead Laborer").
    10. Near the entrance of the same room mentioned above. Has a guaranteed drop of a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore").
    11. In the first room when coming from the Undead Crypt Entrance bonfire.

In Scholar of the First Sin, there is another one who spawns after lighting the brazier located at the middle of the bridge in the main hall. This Insolent does not drop anything, though, and acts more as a tutorial fight.
