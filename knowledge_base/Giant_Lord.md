**The Giant Lord** is a [Boss](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **The Giant Lord** , seemingly the leader of the Giants that invaded Drangleic, stands out due to his immense stature and more slender physique compared to his kin. Unlike other Giants wielding crude clubs, **The Giant Lord** brandishes a colossal sword, making him a formidable adversary. [Bosses](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses") are unique and challenging Enemies that drop [Boss Souls](/Boss+Souls "Dark Souls 2 Boss Souls") capable of being transformed into powerful [Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons"), [Spells](/Spells "Dark Souls 2 Spells"), and [Items](/Items "Dark Souls 2 Items") for the player.

### Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord Information 

**The Giant Lord** is a boss in Dark Souls 2, who is

within the Memory of Jeigh, which is found behind the King's Door in The Forest of Fallen Giants next to The Place Unbeknownst bonfire.   
  
**The Giant Lord** appears to be the leader of the Giants who invaded Drangleic. He's quite a lot bigger and more slender than most other Giants. Unlike every other Giant, the **Giant Lord** wields a huge sword as opposed to the crude clubs most commonly seen in use by the Giants. He drops the Giant's Kinship, which will allow you to enter the final boss fight (having beaten the Throne Defender & Throne Watcher). It is required for progression.

### Giant Lord Attacks in DKS2
    
    
    |  | Description | Counter Measures |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Stomp | Akin to the Last Giant's stomp, it has a slight tracking and will inflict massive damage if it connects. | roll |
    | Swing | The Giant Lord swings his sword from the front towards the back of him. This attack can and will hit you if standing behind his right leg. This attack can be followed up with a sword slam in front of him. | roll |
    | Frontal Slam | The Giant Lord takes a step forward and slams his greatsword into the ground in front of him. This attack has a tricky roll-timing and is often used when you approach him to engage the fight. Sorcerers should take extra care, as he will use it when you are at range. | roll |
    | Frontal Stab | The Giant Lord stabs his sword in front of him in a quick motion. | roll |
    

### NPC Summons

  * [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo") can be summoned for this encounter, provided the player has visited him in the [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Orro"). To do this, his dialogue must be exhausted outside the [Old Akelarre](/Old+Akelarre "Dark Souls 2 Old Akelarre") in the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") and at central [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle").
  * [Captain Drummond](/Captain+Drummond "Dark Souls 2 Captain Drummond") is an NPC Summon for the Giant Lord Boss Fight in Memory of Jeigh if dialogue is exhausted.

### Strategy

  * Wait for the fire bombs to land, then approach the boss. These continue to land during and even after the fight, so avoid backing up into their range during the fight.
  * Melee builds: stand near his feet and circle him dodging his swipes and stomps. Avoid locking on, as the tight quarters can make it difficult to see what's going on. Staying right by his feet makes most of his moves useless besides a stomp that's highly telegraphed and easy to dodge. 
  * Ranged builds: move to a platform left of the boss and shoot from there, while occasionally dodging his downward swing.
  * The Giant Lord is weak to dark damage and is not immune to poison or bleed damage.
  * Using Great Resonant Souls with Dark Caitha's Chime +10 and Abyss Seal under 53int+faith deals 955-1005 damage (requires all 14 shots acquired in NG to take down Giant Lord so ignore the lesser giants, wait until the statue head breaks the ballista on the right and then go straight to Giant Lord, once you reached the upper platform then you're mostly safe), while Dark Hail with Dark Sunset Staff +5 under 53int+faith deals 1500 damage if all orbs hit the Giant Lord.

### Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord Hints

  * The platform to the left of the boss is nearly safe. He will not walk up it unless you purposely kite him there.
  * The statue's head can separate the lesser giants from the boss arena, eliminating the need of fighting those lesser giants under NG+7 difficulty. 95% of the time, you don't need to bother with the Giants at all. If one is still alive after the statue head rolls, you can kill the Giant or Homeward Bone/Feather out.
  * Stay with his left leg to avoid the sword attack.
  * It is possible to pull the Giant Lord into the fire bombs using ranged attacks, but he takes no damage.
  * It is possible to farm this boss endlessly to acquire souls. Simply use a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") on the bonfire near the withered giant used to access the memory and then grab the ascetic on the first raised area of the wall to the left. It is also worth noting that there are two twinkling titanite down the small drop next to the memory so you can grab them and use a homeward bone/aged feather then continue onward and kill the boss. There is also a divine blessing behind a column on the right just before the boss, but be careful as it is within the area that gets bombarded by fireballs. You cannot gather multiple Souls of a Giant with this, however. 
  * In Vammar's Memory, there is a Bonfire Ascetic on the roof with two pyromancers. If you take the Ascetic from both memories, it can be a way to farm Ascetics.
  * When farming him for souls, the use of the [Tseldora Set](/Tseldora+Set "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Set") is highly suggested, along with the [Covetous Silver Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Silver+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Silver Serpent Ring") +2. 
  * The best strategy is to maximize dark damage as much as possible and ignore survivability, which means the [Dark Clutch Ring](/Dark+Clutch+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Dark Clutch Ring") is a must. For melee, use a weapon which naturally does dark damage that has been dark infused and buffed with [Dark Weapon](/Dark+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Dark Weapon"). The first soft cap for Strength, Dex, Faith, and Intelligence is 40, so leveling up beyond that will have diminishing returns.
  * The most effective method of farming him appears to be as a [hexer](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes") buffed with [Unleash Magic](/Unleash+Magic "Dark Souls 2 Unleash Magic"). At max faith/intelligence you can net a minimum of 1,400 damage per [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Great Resonant Soul") with a Dark [Chime of Want](/Chime+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Chime of Want") \+ [Dark Clutch Ring](/Dark+Clutch+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Dark Clutch Ring") \+ [Abyss Seal](/Abyss+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Abyss Seal"). 
  * Alternate caster strategies include casting [Dark Hail](/Dark+Hail "Dark Souls 2 Dark Hail") with a Dark [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff") or maximizing lightning damage and casting [Heavenly Thunder](/Heavenly+Thunder "Dark Souls 2 Heavenly Thunder") while right underneath him.
