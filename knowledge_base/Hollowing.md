**Hollowing** is a game mechanic in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. It is a returning mechanic from the first _Dark Souls_ and functions in a similar way. Upon player death or affliction of certain ailments they will visually change and return Hollowed.

### Causes of Hollowing

  * Death
  * [Curse](/Curse "Dark Souls 2 Curse") affliction
  * [Petrification](/Petrification "Dark Souls 2 Petrification") affliction

### Hollowing Effects

  * Becoming Hollow prevents the player from summoning [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") or other players in co-op.
  * Becoming Hollowing prevents the player from utilizing items to invade other players, but can still be invaded themselves.
  * Becoming Hollow offers new dialogue for certain NPCs.
  * Under normal circumstances Hollowing will lower player [HP](/HP "Dark Souls 2 HP") by 5% following each death or affliction of Curse, capping at 50% HP.
  * Petrification results in 20% lowered HP, capping at 50% HP.
  * HP can be lowered even further if the Player has [sinned](/Sin "Dark Souls 2 Sin") to the point of being labeled 'Wretch', resulting in a eventual cap of 5% of total HP.
  * The damage of the [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame") will scale according to one's Hollowing. Maximum effect at full Hollowing.
  * The damage of the [Greatsword of The Forlorn](/Greatsword+of+The+Forlorn "Dark Souls 2 Greatsword of The Forlorn") will scale according to one's Hollowing. Maximum effect at full Hollowing.
  * The damage of the [Scythe of The Forlorn](/Scythe+of+The+Forlorn "Dark Souls 2 Scythe of The Forlorn") will scale according to one's Hollowing. Maximum effect at full Hollowing.

### Preventing Hollowing

  * [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") alleviates Hollowing upon consumption.
  * Pray at the altar deep in the [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana"), does not work if the player has [Human Effigies](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy").
  * [Ring of Binding](/Ring+of+Binding "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Binding") halves the HP penalty effect of Hollowing when worn, the normal max cap becoming 75% HP.
  * [Ring of Life Protection](/Ring+of+Life+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Life Protection") prevents Hollowing after death when worn, breaks upon use.
  * [Ring of Soul Protection](/Ring+of+Soul+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Soul Protection") prevents Hollowing after death when worn, breaks upon use. Protects against petrification.
  * Summoned from a sign using the [Small White Sign Soapstone](/Small+White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 Small White Sign Soapstone") or the [White Sign Soapstone](/White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 White Sign Soapstone") and assist in killing a [boss](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses").
  * Wearing [King's Crown](/King's+Crown "Dark Souls 2 King's Crown"), [Crown of the Sunken King](/Crown+of+the+Sunken+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Sunken King"), [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King"), [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King")   
after [Vendrick's Blessing](/Vendrick's+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick's Blessing") has been obtained.
