### How to get Infantry Axe in Dark Souls 2

### DS2 Infantry Axe Hints and Tips

  * Upgradeable with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10
  * Okay choice for Strength focused classes at early-game.
  * Despite it's description, the axe actually deals a decent amount of damage.
  * Small, light and quick. Great against small hordes as most attacks are horizontal.
  * Rather low durability, unreliable as a main weapon for PvE.
  * You can purchase a [Club](/Club "Dark Souls 2 Club") pretty early from [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia"), a better choice in most cases.
