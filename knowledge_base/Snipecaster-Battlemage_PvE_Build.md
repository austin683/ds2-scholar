###  Build Strategy

This build takes advantage of the sorcerer's long-range spells, and makes extensive use of the Binoculars. Using simple sorceries like Soul Arrow while zooming in with the Binoculars, you can land critical hits before the enemy even knows you're there! If the enemy gets too close, switch over to your Fire Longsword and let'em have it! 

  1. Go get the [Binoculars](/Binoculars "Dark Souls 2 Binoculars") by the cliff in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula").
  2. Go find [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") early off to get a second [Soul Arrow](/Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Soul Arrow").
  3. Go get the [Great Soul Arrow](/Great+Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Great Soul Arrow") found in the second half of the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"), in the room with the ballista trap.
  4. Go get the Fire-Infused [Longsword](/Longsword "Dark Souls 2 Longsword") found in a chest defended by a [Flame Salamander](/Flame+Salamander "Dark Souls 2 Flame Salamander") in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants").
  5. Go buy the [Elite Knight Gloves](/Elite+Knight+Gloves "Dark Souls 2 Elite Knight Gloves") and [Elite Knight Leggings](/Elite+Knight+Leggings "Dark Souls 2 Elite Knight Leggings") from [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer").
  6. Go buy [Dark Orb](/Dark+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Dark Orb") and [Dark Weapon](/Dark+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Dark Weapon") from [Felkin the Outcast](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast")in the [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse"), then obtain the [Hexer Set](/Hexer+Set "Dark Souls 2 Hexer Set") and [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff") from him.
