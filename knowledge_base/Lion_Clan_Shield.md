**Lion Clan Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Shield used by the Lion Clan warriors. Made of wood, but reinforced with metal. Light yet sturdy._

     _The design on the shield appears to have some religious significance,  
but we will never know what sort of gods these warriors answer to."_

### Acquired From:

  * Random drop from [Lion Warriors](/Lion+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Warrior") in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods").

### Lion Clan Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Provides both Curse and Petrification resistance.
  * Despite being inferior to [Golden Wing Shield](/Golden+Wing+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Golden Wing Shield") and [Stone Shield](/Stone+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Stone Parma"), the high Physical damage reduction and low strength requirement is a good consideration.
  * This shield reappears in _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Wargod Wooden Shield](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Wargod+Wooden+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Wargod Wooden Shield").
