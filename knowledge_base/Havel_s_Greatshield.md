**Havel's Greatshield** is a [ Greatshield](/Greatshields "Dark Souls 2 Greatshields") in Dark Souls 2. **Greatshields** can be used not only to block an enemy but allows player to do a **shield bash**(Greatshields replace the parry ability with a heavy shield bash).

     _"A shield formed by chiseling a giant boulder. As solid as a rock, this shield is also very heavy._

     _So heavy, in fact, that he who takes it into battle is not allowed to flee, until either he or his opponent has fallen."_

### Acquired From

  * [The Gutter.](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter") The first bonfire. Get the [Forgotten Key](/Forgotten+Key "Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Key") from [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch"). On the first platform after the bonfire, jump to the platform on the upper left and proceed past the enemies to the room full of poisonous statues and open the door using the Forgotten Key. It will be in a pot along with the other parts of the Havel set.

### Havel's Greatshield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Offers some of the best damage reductions in exchange for the most weight compared to other shields.
  * The ideal shield for any tank build. the incredible stability means you'll be losing very little stamina from melee attacks, usually allowing you to regain the stamina lost between attacks while keeping your shield up. the weight and the strength requirement mean it's not viable unless you're committing to a strength+vitality build.
  * A good countermeasure against this shield would be a Mundane [Mail Breaker](/Mail+Breaker "Dark Souls 2 Mail Breaker"), Bleed or Poison weapons.
  * The shield bash will become extremely powerful when the shield is upgraded to +5. Great for staggering opponents.
  * Havel's Greatshield has appeared throughout the series, including in  _[Dark Souls](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Havel's+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Havel's Greatshield")_ and _[Dark Souls III](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Havel's+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Havel's Greatshield")_.
