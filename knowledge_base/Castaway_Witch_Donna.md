#  Castaway Witch Donna 

Castaway Witch Donna is an invading dark spirit in Dark Souls II

  * She wears the Black Witch Hat and Agdayne's Set
  * She wields the Staff of Amana mainly loaded with Homing Soul Arrow, Crystal Soul Spear and the Grand Spirit Tree Shield.
  * She will occasionally cast Profound Still, which coupled with her higher magic resistance, makes it tough to defeat her by sorceries.
  * When she kills you she will use the "I'm Sorry" Carving.

## Strategy:

She carries a shield and will block most of the spells thus it is difficult to hit her with spells, especially slow casting ones as she will stagger you with her Crystal soul spear before you can finish casting. She will follow the player until they reach inside lift room. Once the player stands on the platform, she will start backing down. She also runs back to her spawn point quite fast, so it is difficult to catch her before she reaches near the Rampant Golem with a melee built.

  * She is accompanied by a Rampart Golem and it is advised to fight both separately.
  * If melee built, lure her about halfway from the Rampart Golem and the exit platform and fight her there.
  * At ranged, it is recommended to fight her nearer the exit platform.
  * Somehow, the range of her spells is lesser than the player, as one can hit her from a soul arrow, even when she is running towards you, but if u take the same distance to back out from her homing spell, it doesn't reach you. (Not sure if Soul arrow has longer range than Homing soul arrow, or the witch's spells are of shorter range).
  * The hex - Profound Still is very useful in this fight, since most of her attacks are spells. She will attempt to come at melee range and attack with her staff if she is hit.
  * The item Seed of Tree of Giant can be used to make the Rampant Golem attack her.
