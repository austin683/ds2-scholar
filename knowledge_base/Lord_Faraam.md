Hello everyone.  
That's another and maybe the last build I'll upload, I didn't play Dark Souls II in a while, and onestly I dont find this game fun anymore.   
I mean, I really enjoyed how this game give you the opportunity to be an inexorable asshole, but it has nothing more.   
I can letterly upload new build, with other combination, but onestly I though Froms can give us more... Btw.   
  
The SC, is the Knight (which is basically the basic from all my build), full Faraam +10, enchanted Moon Sword +5 (nerfed, crystal wp would be perfect.. Patched), Chloromanthy +2, Third Dragon Ring, Southern Bend +2, Sorcery Clutch Ring, enchanted Witchtree Branch, the weight load meta is 49,9.   
  
  
If you have any suggestion/question contact me on steam   
!important!:  
Sorry for the editing, it's not goes how I figure out...
