###  **Acquired From**

  * It is dropped by killing [Mild Mannered Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate") when you encounter him in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants").
  * Alternatively, if you leave him alive, get the white soapstone off him and exhaust all dialogue options you are able to summon him for [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant") Boss fight, if you do and he survives the fight then you can meet him later at [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") where he will give you all of his related gear here, including his ring, [Ring of Thorns](/Ring+of+Thorns#fex "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Thorns#fex")

  * Secondary Alternative: if left alive he moves on to [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") where if you exhaust the dialogue options of [Creighton the Wanderer](/Creighton+the+Wanderer "Dark Souls 2 Creighton the Wanderer"), and he has moved on as well, you will find the two of them fighting each other later on; if you choose to help Pate, he will reward you with [Pate's Spear](/Pate%27s+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Pate%27s Spear") and other various items relating to him here as well, if you didn't receive them in earthen peak. If you choose to help [Creighton ](/Creighton+the+Wanderer "Dark Souls 2 Creighton the Wanderer")then you will receive [Pate's Spear](/Pate%27s+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Pate%27s Spear"), [Ring of Thorns](/Ring+of+Thorns "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Thorns"), and Creighton's armor set. 
    * _Choosing to help Pate and killing Creighton makes his set purchasable from the Melentia._

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgrades with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * The moveset combines elements of both the spear and lance moveset. When one handed, all attacks use the spear moveset with the exception of the R1 running attack, which is replaced by the lance running attack (note that the backstep attack is still that of the normal spear). 
  * The two handed moveset utilizes even more of the lance moveset. The backstep R1 and the running R1 are both taken from the standard lance moveset. The R2 attack seems to be a combination of both spear and lance, and is different than other spears.
  * Is just a hair shorter than the pike and at 40 dexterity this is a versatile weapon with a solid attack rating of ~340 and requires only 16 strength to powerstance. Effective for both PvE and PvP.
