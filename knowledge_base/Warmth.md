**Warmth** is a [Pyromancy](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Warmth** , a lost pyromancy safeguarded within the Undead Crypt. Conjures a gentle, warm flame that bestows healing upon those in its proximity. Fire, a manifestation of strength, also symbolizes wisdom and solace—its nature shaped by the intentions of the caster. [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") are offensive fire spells that do not demand [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith") or [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") prerequisites and can be executed with a [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") or [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame"). The fire damage scales with [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"), yet there are no specific stat requirements for casting pyromancies. However, opponents resistant to fire damage remain unaffected by [Pyromancy Spells](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies").

> "One of the lost pyromancies preserved only in the Undead Crypt. Creates a gentle, warm flame that heals those who touch it.  
> Fire can be a show of strength, but it is also a symbol of wisdom and comfort. Fire is what the caster wishes it be."
