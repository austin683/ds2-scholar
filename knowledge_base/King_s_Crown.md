**King's Crown** is a [Helm](/Helms "Dark Souls 2 Helms") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki").

_"What makes a king? Some say that it is a birthright, while others call it destiny.  
Perhaps it is not important, as long as the king's name serves to unite his people."  
_

### Location

  * [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana") behind a door and vines after the 2nd bonfire, look along the left side across a slightly hidden stone bridge. Only available if you've killed [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") in the [Undead Crypt ](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt")and are in human form. (Using Ring of the dead does not count) Found in the same place as the [Soul of the King.](/Soul+of+the+King "Dark Souls 2 Soul of the King")
  * To be clear, you must be human to open the door. If you are hollow, it will be locked.

### King's Crown Notes

  * Part of the [King's Set](/King's+Set "Dark Souls 2 King's Set").
  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")
  * Grants +3 [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith").
  * Once King's Crown, [Crown of the Sunken King](/Crown+of+the+Sunken+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Sunken King Helm"), [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King Helm"), and [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King Helm") are collected, speak to [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") in his [memory](/memory+of+the+king "Dark Souls 2 memory of the king") for a brief cutscene imbuing the King's Crown with magic. 
    * While having _any_ of the 4 crowns equipped after the cutscene adds a hidden effect that prevents hollowing. Effect only lasts for the current playthrough.
