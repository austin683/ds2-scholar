### DKS2 Yorgh's Spear Acquired From

  * Trading Soul of [Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon](/Sinh%2C+the+Slumbering+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Sinh%2C the Slumbering Dragon") \+ 14000 souls with [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex").

### Dark Souls 2 Yorgh's Spear Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5
  * _Resistances change considerably_ : magic, lightning, fire and dark resistance are reduced by 70, whilst poison is increased by 200. Bleed, petrify and curse are increased by 70
  * Can be powerstanced with [Piercing Swords](/Piercing+Swords "Dark Souls 2 Piercing Swords"), [Spear](/Spear "Dark Souls 2 Spear"), [Helix Halberd](/Helix+Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Helix Halberd") and [Lance](/Lances "Dark Souls 2 Lances") type weapons, but not [Santier's Spear](/Santier%27s+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Santier%27s Spear").
  * Although you cannot power stance this weapon with Santier's Spear, the huge variety of movesets of both can catch people off guard while wielded together, while Santier's Spear moveset will make it even more agile. equip both Illusory Rings if you decided to go for dual wielding Yorgh's Spear and Santier's Spear to make it even more unpredictable.
  * A useful combo for Santier + Yorgh moveset is Santiner rolling 1H L1 + Yorgh 1H R1/R2 for strafing and Santier L1 + Yorgh R1 for slightly faster Yorgh poking.
  * This weapon is devastating in PvE. With 40 DEX/40 STR and a Yorgh's Spear+5 you may deal up to 1500 damage with (relatively) quick two-handed R1-R1 combo (tested on dragons in Dragon Aerie).
  * Seems to respond extremely well to infusion; when infused with Magic, Fire, Lightning, or dark, the elemental damage alone is almost as much as the physical was before infusing (281 at +5 vs 300). This can prove extremely useful as a single 2h R1 can do well over 900 damage to other players with [Old Leo ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring"), +5 magic infusion, and [Great Magic Weapon](/Great+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Great Magic Weapon"), and result in a near instant victory with its deadly combo potential.
