**Hollow Skin** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki").

_"A hood imitating the head of a Hollow._   
_Provides curse resistance, and makes it easier to detect messages from other worlds._   
_Finely crafted to perfectly imitate the head of a Hollow, only without the abhorrent stench._   
_Whoever created this was surely deeply respectful of those lost to Hollowing."_

### Location

  * Found in [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower"): After placing the Scorching Iron Scepter next to the Foyer bonfire, take the elevator up, step out and go to the next elevator going up. As soon as you step on the elevator move close to the front wall and keep pressing the "interact" button as it goes up. When it comes down an illusory wall will be open, roll into that room and open the chest that contains the Hollow Skin.

### Hollow Skin Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Upgraded stats are 4 times higher and physical defenses are 6 times higher.
  * Completely negates [Curse](/Curse "Dark Souls 2 Curse").
  * When worn during [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") boss fight, it turns the cursing effect of grey wisps into regular damage (damage type and amount unknown).
  * Grants the effect of the [Guidance](/Guidance "Dark Souls 2 Guidance") miracle, allowing the wearer to identify illusionary walls.
