**Heide Spear** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**.

> _A spear originating in Heide.  
>   
>  A special alloy makes it very durable._   
>   
>  _The composition of the alloy of these spears remains a mystery, but in Drangleic the attempt to imitate it resulted in the similar bradden steel._

###  **Acquired From**

  * Drops from the spear-wielding [Heide Knights](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") in the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille")
  * Drops from the spear-wielding [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") in [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame") (SotFS)
  * Guaranteed drop from the [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") in [Sinners' Rise](/Sinners'+Rise "Dark Souls 2 Sinners' Rise") (SotFS)

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgrades with regular titanite
  * This weapon shares it's move set with the [Stone Soldier Spear](/Stone+Soldier+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Stone Soldier Spear").
  * Lightning infusion is a straightforward upgrade for this spear, it loses a neglectable amount of physical damage.
  * This is the best spear in the game for pure faith or dex/faith build. Technically, [Yorgh's Spear](/Yorgh's+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Yorgh's Spear") has more AR, but it requires 30 str and has a resistance penalty. Difference is very small though, usually around 10-15 AR. Generally speaking, its not worth 18 more stat points into str.

With 30 str, 25 dex, 99 faith: 

Lightning Heide Spear - 505 AR 

Lightning Yorgh's Spear - 515 AR
