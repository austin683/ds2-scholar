#  Rise of the Dead

* * *

##  Location:

#### 

After finishing off the Demon of Song in the Shrine of Amana, you will notice a path off to the right as you head towards the Undead Crypt (it may be easier to see and follow when holding a torch). Follow this path into the tower. (Sotfs: The doorway is blocked by petrified hollow that you need Fragrant Branch of Yore for). Inside you will find the bonfire on the bottom floor. There is a locked door up the spiral staircase. (rescue the 2 [Milfanito](/Milfanito) to unlock the door {the one before the demon of song, and one from unlocking the embedded})   
NOTE: You must **not** be human to unlock the door.   

##  Bosses:

None   

##  Bonfire Ascetic Use:

####  Burning a bonfire ascetic here respawns the following items/enemies

  * [Aldia Warlock](/Aldia+Warlock)
  * [Hollow Crawler](/Hollow+Crawler)

##  Special Notes:

This area contains the Fire of Nito which the [Milfanito](/Milfanito) pray to. If you pray to the fire (upon prompt) when you are hollow and have no human effigies in your inventory you will become human again. It is the game's fail safe to allow for becoming human when all other options are unavailable.
