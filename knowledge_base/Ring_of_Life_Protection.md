### Dark Souls 2 Ring of Life Protection Effects

**Durability** : 340

**Weight:** 1.0

  * Do not turn Hollow or lose Souls upon death. Will not prevent death by [Petrification](/Petrification "Dark Souls 2 Petrification"), but dying from petrification while wearing the ring will still retain all souls and human form. Breaks when activated but can be repaired for 3000 souls (14000 in SotFS). *Note: If you are cursed while wearing this ring, you will turn hollow but the ring will not break. You will need to spend one Human Effigy (or other ways of regaining humanity) to return to human form.

### DS2 Ring of Life Protection Tips and Notes

  * You will retain souls and humanity upon death. You may, however, still be cursed and thus lose your humanity even if you don't die (for example during the Nashandra boss fight).
  * You may also treat this as a method of taking off [Black Dragon Set](/Black+Dragon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Set") as it requires dying (but not necessary to be hollowing) to take off the armor.
  * This ring CAN be repaired at a blacksmith for 14000 souls in SotFS version. This makes it a very useful way of remaining human without burning through your Human Effigies. Essentially, this ring allows you to purchase unlimited human effigies for 14000 souls in SotFS version, with an added bonus of not having to retrieve your souls.
  * If you die without this ring equipped, you can equip it, and essentially die a second time and your original bloodstain will NOT disappear except if you died when you're invading as Red Phantom. This is most likely because you are not dropping a new bloodstain when you die with this ring on. This also applies to the [Ring of Soul Protection](/Ring+of+Soul+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Soul Protection"). This is a great way to retrieve souls if you do not want to wear this ring 100% of the time, and instead simply equip it when it's needed.
