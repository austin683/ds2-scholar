**Work Hook** is a **[Claw Weapon](/Fist+Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Fist Weapons")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Work Hook** is known for its unique potential when infused with mundane. The mundane infusion significantly increases its strength. When infused with Bleed, its performance is comparable to the [Bandit's Knife](/Bandit's+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Bandit's Knife") and default [Claws](/Claws "Dark Souls 2 Claws"). Equipping it in an active slot boosts [Dexterity](/Dexterity "Dark Souls 2 Dexterity") by 5 but decreases [Adaptability](/Adaptability "Dark Souls 2 Adaptability") by 3.

> A hook that covers the hand.   
>    
>  Clearly not intended as a weapon, but certainly sharp enough to shred an enemy's skin. 

### How to get Work Hook in Dark Souls 2

  * Dropped by a [Mimic](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic") in Earthen Peak, in a room filled with poison urns.

### DS2 Work Hook Hints & Tips

  * By using mundane on this weapon it will definitely become stronger, unless your lowest stat is 1. (mundane scales based on your lowest stat, for each point under 20 is 6 damage added to 1/2 of base damage) So at +0 with 2 being your lowest stat you'll have 22+62 damage, therefore, this is a mundane dedicated weapon.
  * if you infused it with Bleed, the result is close to [Bandit's Knife](/Bandit%27s+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Bandit%27s Knife") and default [Claws](/Claws "Dark Souls 2 Claws"), but with less physical damage.
  * When equipped in an active slot, increases Dexterity by 5, but decreases Adaptability by 3.
  * **Apparently the work hook degrades enemies equipment. (needs testing)**
