**Mirrah Hat** is a Helm in Dark Souls 2.

  
_A hat from the land of Mirrah. An elite order of knights in a far land used this hat in a ceremonial capacity. Masterfully crafted, but of little practical use on the battlefield._

### Location

  * Found in [Frigid Outskirts](/Frigid+Outskirts "Dark Souls 2 Frigid Outskirts"), on a corpse next to outer wall of the ruins closest to summon signs.
  * [Location Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvHZNOPYG7k)

### Mirrah Hat Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * An alternate masked version of this hat is worn by [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah").
  * There is a glitch where if you go down a set of stairs, the feather stretches upwards. It can be reversed by going up stairs.
  * [Speculation] Presence of this mask in Frigid Outskirts might mean that she died there, but it's unlikely since she has another mask and her adventure ends in Aldia's Keep.
