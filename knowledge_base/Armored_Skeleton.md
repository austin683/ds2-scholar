**Armored Skeleton** is an [enemy](/enemies "Dark Souls 2 enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Armored Skeletons** , resurrected from humanoid remains through necromancy, are controlled by a Necromancer. Continuously revived until their master's demise, their past allegiances, be it to the Iron King or otherwise, are irrelevant in their current undead state. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Armored Skeleton Information in Dark Souls 2

Skeletons are enemies in Dark Souls II. They can first be encountered in the basement of the [Majula Mansion](/Majula+Mansion "Dark Souls 2 Majula Mansion"). They are reanimated remains of humanoids, and manifestations of necromancy. In most cases, if a skeleton is nearby, so is a [Hollow Mage (Black)](/Hollow+Mage+%28Black%29 "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Mage %28Black%29"). This is not true for the [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") and [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley") skeleton. Those that are slain can be revived repeatedly by a nearby [Hollow Mage (Black)](/Hollow+Mage+%28Black%29 "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Mage %28Black%29"), until the Hollow Mage is killed. Skeletons are relatively weak, both in damage and HP, but move and attack swiftly. They also have the ability to parry, if carrying a shield. They are extremely resilient to thrust (i.e. spear) based attacks, somewhat resistant to slash (i.e. sword) based attacks, and weak against strike (i.e. mace) based attacks. Oddly, skeletons are vulnerable to [Yearn](/Yearn "Dark Souls 2 Yearn") and [Alluring Skull](/Alluring+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Alluring Skull"), as they're mindless, in short, [Force](/Force "Dark Souls 2 Force") can dispatch them by pushing them to bottomless pit.   
  
_"This curved sword-wielding Skeleton is hiding in Cale's house in Majula. It's unknown whose Skeleton this might be or what force animates it; perhaps Cale inadvertently disturbed this poor soul's resting place. Either way, it must be dispatched before Cale will return to the residence… and if you want the treasures it guards." - Majula Skeleton Description_   
  
_"These reanimated corpses are often under the control of a Necromancer, and they will be revived repeatedly until their Wizard is killed. Whether they served the Iron King or fled from his troops in life makes no difference now, as they are the property of their necromantic masters" - Huntsman's Copse Skeleton Description_   
  
_The skeletons in this region are of unknown origins. They could be former subjects of the Iron King who were worked to death in the poisonous mines or poor Souls who wandered in more recently. Regardless, whether it was the massive Pools of Poison or giant monsters overseeing the Laborers, something killed these poor fools… but they've left it to you to finish the job." - Harvest Valley Skeleton Description_
