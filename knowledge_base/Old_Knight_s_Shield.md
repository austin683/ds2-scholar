**Old Knight's Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"An undated ancient shield._

     _Wielded by a warrior from a time so ancient that there exists no record of his endeavors. Has extremely low durability._

     _Sometimes, just as a thing falls to pieces, it unleashes its last flash of great power..."_

### Acquired From:

  * Dropped by [Old Knights](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") (Sword and Shield)
  * Chance to drop from the [Dark Spirit](/Dark+Spirit "Dark Souls 2 Dark Spirit") on the ship at [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man%27s Wharf") (NG+). 

### 

### Old Knight's Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Has the highest stability rating of all the medium shields and excellent all around defense stats. Well worth using if the strength requirements are met. Be wary of the low durability. (Durability is OK for NG.)
