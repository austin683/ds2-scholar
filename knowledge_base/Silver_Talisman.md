**Silver Talisman** is a type of [Consumable](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. The **Silver Talisman** is a tiny charm embedded with imitative magic, allowing you to transform into something to blend in. It serves as a tool to hide from invaders, offering only the most superficial camouflage, yet sometimes that is enough to do the trick. [Consumable Items](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") grant various effects such as restorative properties for recovering HP, removing certain negative status effects, applying temporary buffs and debuffs, as well as activating various actions and effects.

### Silver Talisman Usage

  * Transform into an object in the current environment, similarly to the [Chameleon](/Chameleon "Dark Souls 2 Chameleon") spell.

### Silver Talisman Location

  * 4x In a jar in a side cavern in the "arena" of the two giants hidden beneath [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch").
  * Sold by [Titchy Gren](/Gren "Dark Souls 2 Gren"). Sells an infinite amount.
  * Dropped by Dragon Priests in [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine").
  * 2x In a trapped wooden chest near [Lonesome Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan") in [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man%27s Wharf").

### Silver Talisman Notes and Tips

  * Counts as a [Body Buff](/Buffs+&+Debuffs "Dark Souls 2 Buffs & Debuffs").
  * You will break camouflage if you roll, interact, use items, gesture, or take damage. You can however operate summon signs without breaking camouflage.
  * You can still block while camouflaged as long as you don't get your guard broken.
  * Falling will not break camouflage so long as your character does not roll when they land. (This only happens from falling from a high enough height.)
  * You can still sprint.
  * You will break camouflage if going from one area to the next. Ex: [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") >> [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants").
  * NPC summons are not fooled by invaders using silver talismans, and will attack them when in range.
  * Not all areas will have the same set of objects you may transform into. Some areas will allow you to blend as a rock or crate, while in other areas you will blend as pottery or paintings.
  * If you use this talisman in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+Of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine Of Amana") you will turn into [Elizabeth Mushroom](/Elizabeth+mushroom "Dark Souls 2 Elizabeth mushroom")
