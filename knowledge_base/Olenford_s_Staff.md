**Olenford's Staff** is a **[Staff](/Staves "Dark Souls 2 Staves")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Olenford's Staff** is a powerful catalyst for sorceries and hexes, used by Olenford the sorcerer. You can find it in a secret room in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") by using a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros'+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone") on a hidden wall. However, be cautious as the room is dangerous and you may want to do this while a phantom is present.

### How to get Olenford's Staff in Dark Souls 2

  * [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"). Reveal a secret room from a hidden wall in the pit that leads to the shortcut lever, then use a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros'+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone").* It is wise to grab this while a phantom is present, for its location is in a dangerous room. In this room, a hollow will repeatedly ring a bell, summoning approx. 5 Leydia Pyromancers. They will continue to be summoned by the bell even if you kill them, and they deal high damage. If you're making a quick run, equip the [Ring of Life Protection](/Ring+of+Life+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Life Protection") and identify the illusory wall (the wall will be flat unlike the rest of the wall) and use a Lockstone. Then, quickly use a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"), and go hit the new illusory wall, and claim the staff. (Or you can smash the stone slabs the sorcerers are summoned from so that they can never be summoned there again even after resting at a bonfire)* Alternately, destroying the tombstones producing the Leydia Pyromancers will allow you to obtain the staff safely, and they will remain destroyed for the remainder of your playthrough until the next NG cycle. Be careful of the one down one of the side passages, as the other pyromancers will happily trap you if you haven't killed them yet. Once done, the staff is safely obtained.

### DS2 Olenford's Staff Hints and Tips

  * Basically, a Twinkling Titanite version of [Witchtree Branch](/Witchtree+Branch "Dark Souls 2 Witchtree Branch"), although this one is actually much inferior, not only it's heavier and slower, the fully upgraded stat is much worse than Witchtree Branch.
  * Despite being inferior, the stat requirement is, outrageously, 40 Int, twice as high as Witchtree Branch.
  * 362 magic bonus with 50int and 469 dark bonus with 40/30. Outclassed by most when it comes to magic but makes a nice middle ground between witchtree and sunset.
  * **It can be upgraded With**[Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")
