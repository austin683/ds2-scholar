**Titanite Farming** in **Dark Souls 2** is covered on this page.

## Titanite Farming

  
  
Here is a list of areas and enemies which you can farm in order to obtain standard Titanite upgrade ores. As always when farming for drops, remember at least to equip your [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring")—maybe also a [Traveling Merchant Hat](/Traveling+Merchant+Hat "Dark Souls 2 Traveling Merchant Hat"), [Jester's Cap](/Jester's+Cap "Dark Souls 2 Jester's Cap"), or [Prisoner's Hood](/Prisoner's+Hood "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner's Hood")—and to use [Rusted Coins](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin") or [Watchdragon Parma](/Watchdragon+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Watchdragon Parma") if you can.

  * [Titanite Shards](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard") can be looted from the large, green [Steelworker Undead](/Hammersmith "Dark Souls 2 Hammersmith") at lower [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak"), as well from as the peasant villagers in upper [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). Also, one skeleton warrior in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley"), resting his bones in the same cave as [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan"), has a very high drop rate for titanite shards. Once you have cleared [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"), [Stone Trader Chloanne](/Stone+Trader+Chloanne "Dark Souls 2 Stone Trader Chloanne") will sell an unlimited number of Titanite Shards for 1,000 souls each.

  * [Large Titanite Shards](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard") can be found resting in the bellies of the [Parasitic Spiders](/Ducal+Spider "Dark Souls 2 Ducal Spider") in lower [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). Some other creatures are also known to carry them around are the [Iron Keep's](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") [Ironclads](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") and the [Black Gulch's](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch") [Coal Tars](/Coal+Tar "Dark Souls 2 Coal Tar"). If the player retrieves the [Dull Ember](/Dull+Ember "Dark Souls 2 Dull Ember") and gives it to [Steady Hand McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff"), he will then sell an unlimited number of Large Titanite Shards for 2,500 souls apiece. [Stone Trader Chloanne](/Stone+Trader+Chloanne "Dark Souls 2 Stone Trader Chloanne") also stocks ten of them after you clear Iron Keep, and an unlimited number once you have cleared [Drangleic Castle.](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") An additional method preferred by some is by farming the [Great Basilisk](/Great+Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Great Basilisk") in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse"). Starting from the first bonfire, go left and jump down on the mushrooms attached to the wall on the right inside the cave. ([Flying Feline Boots](/Flying+Feline+Boots "Dark Souls 2 Flying Feline Boots") or [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") is highly recommended). Kill the [Great Basilisk](/Great+Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Great Basilisk") to obtain 3 [Large Titanite Shards](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard") every time you kill him. (The use of [Homeward Bones](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"), [Homeward](/Homeward "Dark Souls 2 Homeward"), or if you are further in the game, the [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather"), come recommended for speeding up this process).

  * [Titanite Chunks](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk") can be farmed from the big-boned, chunky [Gyrm](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior") at the [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros"). You can also obtain Titanite Chunks or Large Titanite Shards from the dull-witted, superstitious [peasants](/Hollow+Peasant "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Peasant") living near the first bonfire in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"), or you can pry them away from the sticky-fingered Coal Tars in Black Gulch. Alternatively, [Stone Trader Chloanne](/Stone+Trader+Chloanne "Dark Souls 2 Stone Trader Chloanne") sells ten Chunks after you clear the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"), and an unlimited number after you defeat [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra"). Finally, in online play only, the covenant of the [Bell Keepers](/Bell+Keepers "Dark Souls 2 Bell Keepers") makes farming Titanite Chunks sinfully easy; every time that you successfully defeat a host as a Gray Phantom, you are allowed to slice off a Chunk. Tear 'em to shreds! Additionally, using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at the Poison Pool bonfire in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley") will allow you to get 3 [Titanite Chunks](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk") in the first poison mist area.

  * [Titanite Slabs](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab") drop from the stone spear soldiers outside of the King's Gate bonfire in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"), from the [Imperfect](/The+Imperfect "Dark Souls 2 The Imperfect") near the Lair of the Imperfect bonfire in [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon's+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon's Sanctum"), and from the [Iron Warriors](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior") around [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower") and [Iron Passage](/Iron+passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron passage"). They can also be farmed in the [Dragon Aerie](/Dragon+Aerie "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Aerie") from multiple [Crystal Lizards](/crystal+lizard "Dark Souls 2 crystal lizard").

  * [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") drops from the Archdrake Clerics and [Amana Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") in Shrine of Amana. Drop rates were tested against these enemies while wearing a Gold Serpent Ring +2. Clerics have higher drop rate than Priestesses, and 9 pieces were obtained while fighting through entire area once.

  * Probably the best place to farm for Titanite of all kinds, including [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") and infusion ores, is the [Dragon Aerie](/Dragon+Aerie "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Aerie"). After killing the crystal lizards and the [Guardian Dragons](/Guardian+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Guardian Dragon") and looting everything, you can use a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") to respawn 'em all and start again.
