**Manikin Sabre** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Manikin Sabre** is a [Curved Sword](/Curved+Swords "Dark Souls 2 Curved Swords") with a focus on dexterity scaling and additional bleed damage. Its lightweight design and slash-oriented attacks make it suitable for swift and evasive combat

> Small curved sword of the manikins of Harvest Valley.   
>   
>  The peculiar art of puppetry is a vestige of the two lost lands. The Queen, entranced by poison, used it to beckon unknowing souls to the defiled valley.

###  **Acquired From**

  * Dropped by sabre wielding Manikins in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak"). Two can be found just before the Middle bonfire and one more can be found up the ramp from the middle bonfire, through the gate.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * **Trivia** : The Manikin Sabre is clearly based off of the _Kopis_. Starting as a tool used to cut meat and sacrifice animals, it eventually saw use in battle in the **Macedonian Era** through **Hoplites** , who carried  _Xifos_ swords as their secondary weapon once their Spears broke.  
The _Kopis_ would slowly replace the _Xifos_ through Hoplites equipment over time.
