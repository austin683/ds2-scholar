**Dark Souls 2 Summon Range Calculator** \- This calculator is current to [Patch 1.06 - Reg 1.08](/Regulation+1.08 "Dark Souls 2 Regulation 1.08"). Summon and PvP range in Dark Souls 2 is calculated by [soul memory](/soul+memory "Dark Souls 2 soul memory").

## Summon Range Calculator

##### Finding Online Players

  * **Instructions:** Insert your Soul Memory amount the input box, then move the mouse icon to the item you want to know the Soul Memory range.
  * [Patch 1.10](/Patch+1.10 "Dark Souls 2 Patch 1.10") added a function to make random matchmaking easier: when you're in the warp menu, the areas with multiplayer activity close to your [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory") will be outlined in orange.

There is a tier/threshold of soul memory at 45 million, what some players are calling the "Top Tier", upon passing this threshold, soul memory will become meaningless between players. For example: a player with a soul memory of 45 million can invade a player with a soul memory of 700 million, and vice versa. The Name-Engraved Ring reduces the soul memory required to invade and summon players in the "Top Tier". Another thing to note is the Cracked Blue Eye Orb, a player in the Top Tier can invade downwards to 15 million, however the increased range of the blue eye orb will allow players to invade others who are in the 12 million - 15 million range (a sort of pseudo top tier) and vice versa a 12 million player can invade infinitely upwards.   
  
**_Note: NG and NG+ use the same matchmaking formula._**   
  
***Capping at SL 150?** Many Community members have decided to stop increasing their Soul Level at 150, however this was partly due to their belief that matchmaking worked off of soul level and not soul memory in NG+, this has been proved untrue by Community member Illusorywall (found on gamefaqs or his tumblr blog). By part of doing PvP a player will increase his soul memory, eventually to the point that you will start getting matched with players at a much higher soul level. Capping at 150 does have a purpose though. If your intention is to participate in organised PvP events vs players at 150 only, capping at 150 can be for you, also if you want to only use the duel arena(s). However if you want to be invaded by random players and invade random players, there is absolutely no reason to stop increasing your soul level, you will only weaken yourself in online play if you do not. Skill does determine the winner of some fights, but if you were to remain at 150 and consistently increased your soul memory and say, managed to make it past 15 million (The Top Tier), then you will find yourself facing players with soul levels in the hundreds, with 40 in all stats, or higher. However if one wishes to maintain a focused build there is no reason to continue increasing ones Soul Level

  * [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory")

is the total amount of souls that a player has _accumulated_. Spending them does not add to this total amount, merely _earning_ souls add to this total amount, period. Collecting consumable items that grant souls upon use does not increase your Soul Memory. Using those items however will increase your Soul Memory.

  * Soul memory can be checked in the "Player Status" menu. If you are having trouble locating a summon sign it is often beneficial to leave the area and come back.

### Soul Memory Tiers and Exact Ranges for Multiplayer Connections

**How are the ranges calculated?**   
Soul Memory is divided into tiers, but the tiers are not hard boundaries. Instead, different multiplayer items extend across different amounts of neighboring tiers. So there's no direct math involved, it's a question of   
A) What tier am I in?, and   
B) How many tiers above and below my own can I pair up with?   
It is NOT anything like +/- 25%, 50,000, etc.   
  
**The Tiers**   
Here is a list of the tiers. Bolded values in the left column indicate an increase in tier size.
