**Guidance** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle.

> "A miracle created to help those who have lost their way. Reveals more messages from other worlds.
> 
> Countless worlds loosely overlap, and at the seams of contact, kindred souls, who have lost their way, call out to one another with fleeting messages of hope."

### Acquired From

### Notes

  * While Guidance is active any illusory/breakable walls will be marked with messages saying "Search your surroundings."
  * The balcony in Earthen Peak that contains the Spell Quartz Ring +1 is not marked by a message.
