> _Thrusting sword of Chancellor Wellager. Forged with rare geisteel._   
>   
>  _A masterpiece of the great blacksmith Llewellyn that he brought along as a gift when he left Mirrah for Drangleic._

###  **Acquired From**

  * Talk to [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") after defeating the [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord") to receive the Espada Ropera, [Royal Dirk](/Royal+Dirk "Dark Souls 2 Royal Dirk") and [Llewellyn Set](/Llewellyn+Set "Dark Souls 2 Llewellyn Set").

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Regular [Rapier](/Rapier "Dark Souls 2 Rapier") moveset, also parries with right strong attack, but with a better scaling on dex, this one has A scaling instead of B.
  * You can wield [Royal Dirk](/Royal+Dirk "Dark Souls 2 Royal Dirk") on the left hand to compensate the horizontal attack and rolling attack, also it's quite easy to connect the powerstance, hence the intended "Rapier And Dagger" style.

  
**Trivia:**

  * Historically, Espada Ropera (Dress Sword) was a sword developed in the mid-15th century in Spain. The name referred to swords worn by civilians, as opposed for those meant for battlefield use.
  * Compared to earlier thrusting swords, the espada ropera was lighter, thinner, and more ornate.
