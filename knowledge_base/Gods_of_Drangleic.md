**Gods of Drangleic** are long-lost deities prayed to by the various residents of the dilapidated kingdom. Whether or not they are real or fictitious is unknown, only that some of them draw from real figures in history, perhaps known by different names.

### Name-engraved Ring Gods

  * Nehma, Goddess of Love whose symbol is an [Estus Flask](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask").

  * Kremmel, God of Struggle whose symbol is a debuff.
  * Evlana, Goddess of the Hunt whose symbol is an armament.

  * Nahr Alma, God of Blood whose symbol is the [Brotherhood of Blood](/Brotherhood+of+Blood "Dark Souls 2 Brotherhood of Blood") crest.
  * Zinder, God of Desire whose symbol is a pig head, reminiscent of the [Porcine Shield](/Porcine+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Porcine Shield").
  * Quella, God of Dream whose symbol is the spirit tree from [Spirit Tree Shield](/Spirit+Tree+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Spirit Tree Shield") and [Grand Spirit Tree Shield](/Grand+Spirit+Tree+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Grand Spirit Tree Shield").
  * Caffrey, Goddess of Fortune whose symbol is the [souls](/Souls "Dark Souls 2 Souls")/currency icon.

### Other Deities

  * Zandroe, God of Greed
  * War God [Faraam](/Faraam "Dark Souls 2 Faraam")
  * God of Sun

### Perhaps they are the very same gods as ours

Many of the gods of Drangleic bear similarities to past characters from the previous _Dark Souls_ , which is further given credence by the [Hunter's Hat](/Hunter's+Hat "Dark Souls 2 Hunter's Hat")/[Blackbow](/Hunter's+Blackbow "Dark Souls 2 Hunter's Blackbow") description which tells how a ordinary yet skilled bow huntress became deified after death. With this in mind, some comparisons can be drawn between certain characters within reason.

Confirmed:

  * [Pharis](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Pharis "Dark Souls 2 Pharis") is highly likely to be the identity of the unnamed skilled huntress as both the Hunter's Hat and Hunter's Blackbow are attributed to her in both _Dark Souls_ and _Dark Souls 3_. This would make her Evlana, Goddess of the Hunt.

Strong Connection:

  * [Dark Sun Gwyndolin](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Dark+Sun+Gwyndolin "Dark Souls 2 Dark Sun Gwyndolin") has a strong connection to Quella, god of dreams, as members of the [Blue Sentinels](/Blue+Sentinels "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinels") use [Cracked Blue Eye Orbs](/Cracked+Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Blue Eye Orb") just as [Darkmoon Blade](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Blade+of+the+Dark+Moon "Dark Souls 2 Blade of the Dark Moon") knights used [Blue Eye Orbs](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Blue Eye Orb") in _Dark Souls_. The two covenants would be further linked in _Dark Souls 3_. Additionally, the [White Ring](/White+Ring "Dark Souls 2 White Ring") grants an illusionary power which is what Gwyndolin is capable of since he had shrouded Anor Londo with an illusion.
  * [Gravelord Nito](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Nito "Dark Souls 2 Nito") has a strong connection to Galib, god of disease as in the opening cutscene for _Dark Souls_ , Nito "_unleashed a miasma of death and disease_ " after obtaining his Lord soul. Galib is worshipped by [Leydia Witches](/Leydia+Witch "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Witch") who occupy the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"). Curiously, using the [Old Dead One's Soul](/Old+Dead+One's+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Old Dead One's Soul") (Nito's) with [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex") will grant the [Crypt Blacksword](/Crypt+Blacksword "Dark Souls 2 Crypt Blacksword") further linking Nito to the Undead Crypt.
  * [Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Gwyn+Lord+of+Cinder "Dark Souls 2 Gwyn Lord of Cinder") has a strong connection to the God of Sun worshipped by the [Heirs of the Sun](/Heirs+of+the+Sun "Dark Souls 2 Heirs of the Sun"). According to the [Lightning Spear](/Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Lightning Spear") description, it was said to be the legacy of an ancient clan whose leader was revered as the God of Sun. The name of the clan has been lost to time, but the gross incandescence of our magnificent father shall never wane. It references the [Warriors of Sunlight](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Warrior+of+Sunlight "Dark Souls 2 Warrior of Sunlight"), and in particular dialogue from [Solaire of Astora](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Solaire+of+Astora "Dark Souls 2 Solaire of Astora"), who also describes the covenant as adherents to the Lord of Sunlight. The [Old King Soul](/Old+King+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Old King Soul") also grants [Blinding Bolt](/Blinding+Bolt "Dark Souls 2 Blinding Bolt") when given to [Straid](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis"), and mentions the God of Sun. [Aldia](/Aldia,+scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Aldia, scholar of the First Sin") also refers to Gwyn as the Lord of Light.

Loose Connection:

  * The goddess Fina has a loose connection to Nehma, Goddess of Love as while being known for her "fateful beauty", her love is in fact as fickle as the weather. Despite this [Knight Lautrec](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Knight+Lautrec "Dark Souls 2 Knight Lautrec") wore a golden armor set depicting the goddess's embrace, forsaking all else.
  * [Gwynevere](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Gwynevere "Dark Souls 2 Gwynevere"), Princess of Sunlight has a loose connection to Hanleth, Goddess of Bliss as she was cherished by all as the symbol of bounty and fertility. Her miracles were a blessing to many warriors, and Hanleth's title in Japanese is more closely translated to Goddess of Blessing.
  * [Darkstalker Kaathe](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Darkstalker+Kaathe "Dark Souls 2 Darkstalker Kaathe") has a loose connection to Zinder, God of Desire, as they are both serpentine and it is through the Chosen Undead's desire that Kaathe may guide them to becoming the Lord of Dark. It should be noted that many believe the difference between Zinder/Zandroe to be an English translation issue.
  * [Kingseeker Frampt](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Kingseeker+Frampt "Dark Souls 2 Kingseeker Frampt") has a loose connection to Zandroe, God of Greed, as they are both serpentine and is through the Chosen Undead's greed that Frampt may guide them to rekindling the First Flame. It should be noted that many believe the difference between Zinder/Zandroe to be an English translation issue.
  * [Kirk, Knight of Thorns](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Knight+Kirk "Dark Souls 2 Knight Kirk") has a loose connection to Kremmel, God of Struggle, as aside from the similar theme with the [Ring of Thorns](/Ring+of+Thorns "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Thorns"), acquiring the +2 variant of the ring requires invading and defeating other players a thousand times, just as Kirk continuously invades the Chosen Undead in _Dark Souls_.
  * Alternatively, Kirk may also have a loose connection to Nahr Alma, God of Blood, as he is an invader in both _Dark Souls_ and _Dark Souls 3_ , and uses a sword and shield that can both inflict [bleed](/Bleed "Dark Souls 2 Bleed").
  * [Gwyn's Firstborn](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Lord+Gwyn's+Firstborn "Dark Souls 2 Lord Gwyn's Firstborn"), a mentioned-only character from  _Dark Souls,_ has a loose connection to the war god Faraam. Each of them are referred to as war gods, though Gwyn's Firstborn was stripped of his deific status along with his name. They both have an association with lions, given the lion knights of Forossa and the [lion clan warrior](/Lion+Clan+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Clan Warrior") enemies which are later connected in _Dark Souls 3_ to a mad war god, as well as [Dragonslayer Ornstein](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Ornstein+and+Smough "Dark Souls 2 Ornstein and Smough") being the first knight of the Firstborn. It could be that the lion clan warriors are under the same curse as the [crow demons](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Crow+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Crow Demon") from _Dark Souls_ , just from an affiliation with the Firstborn rather than Velka. The Firstborn was also a renowned dragonslayer who later sided with dragons, and a dragon is featured prominently on the [Faraam Helm](/Faraam+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Faraam Helm").
  * Yulva, a mentioned-only character from _Dark Souls,_ has a loose connection to Caitha, Goddess of Tears. Caitha is mentioned in _Dark Souls 3_ , and the [Caressing Tears](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Caressing+Tears "Dark Souls 2 Caressing Tears") miracle is attributed to her. This spell is the same as [Caressing Prayer](/Caressing+Prayer "Dark Souls 2 Caressing Prayer"), which was recently developed, and may not be an authentic [miracle](/Miracles "Dark Souls 2 Miracles"). This is because it's actually similar to the [Remedy](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Remedy "Dark Souls 2 Remedy") sorcery in _Dark Souls_ , which is a sorcery of the red-robed Yulva, one of the Sealers of New Londo.
