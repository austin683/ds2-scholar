**Pilgrim's Spontoon** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**.

> _Spontoon used by warriors on pilgrimage._   
>   
>  _Rather worn from the long journey it has doubtless seen._   
>   
>  _A spear which also doubles as a catalyst for sorceries, making it an ideal choice for light-footed pilgrims._

###  **Acquired From**

  * DLC [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King"): After using the Scorched Iron Scepter, walk from the [Upper Floor](/Upper+Floor "Dark Souls 2 Upper Floor") bonfire, head to the room full of elevators, and hop on the one that leads to a doorway in the wall. Facing the wall, jump to the right to reach the third platform. It's in an iron chest.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Strong attack casts Sorceries/Hexes
  * Buffing it increases its spell damage (similar to the Blue Flame)
  * Can be powerstanced with 17 STR and 18 DEX.
  * Either Infuse path will increase both Magic and Dark scaling, but the base damage decreases slightly, unlike most other weapons.
  * **This weapon has only 2 upgrade paths: Magic and Dark**
