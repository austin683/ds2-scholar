**Wanderer Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
  
_"A hood/coat/manchettes/boots for the roving type._   
_Light, sturdy leather made for long journeys."_   

###  Set Location

  * Starting equipment of Swordman class.
  * Found in [The Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille): find a yard with a well in it and a rock sitting on well's edge, knock the rock in, wait for a cage to arrive and kill three [Rupturing Hollows](/Rupturing+Hollow). 
    * Let hollows out of the cage first, lest loot will drop inside of it and possibly out of direct reach (you'll have to use the elevator found nearby, in a storage with few metal chests and Pharros' contraption, to get above the cage and drop into it to pick up loot).
    * The yard itself is accessed either from Exile Holding Cells bonfire (follow the castle wall, climb down the ladder, cross the storage past a boarded crack in a wall) or from Servants' Quarters bonfire (reach the tower nearby, cross it without going up, follow the castle wall, drop down).
    * [Scholar of the First Sin] Same spot, but loot is attached to a corpse, so it's easily reached.

  
  

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite).
