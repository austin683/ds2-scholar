Requirements: STR 13 / D(*E), DEX 15 / B(*C)

Weapon Type: Piercing Sword

Attack Type: Thrust

Enchantable: Yes

Special: Yes

*When infused: 191 physical dmg/145 elemental dmg and B scaling with chosen element. Dex scaling changes to C. 

**Ice Rapier** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**.

> _Rapiers wielded by sorcerers of Eleum Loyce, imbued with a magic that is released with a strong attack._   
>   
>  _A great protective wall was erected to protect Eleum Loyce from the encroaching chaos, and these sorcerers were amongst its defenders._

###  **Acquired From**

  * DLC: [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King")
  * Dropped by [Rampart Soldier](/Rampart+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Rampart Soldier").

###  **Hints and Tips**

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5.
  * Strong attacks unleash a bolt of ice, similar to a [Soul Spear](/Soul+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Soul Spear"). Hitting an opponent at point blank will cause significantly more damage as you are also hitting with the weapon itself.
  * Strong attack can be parried if within range but the ice bolt can still damage the person parrying, it also neglects spell parry with the exception of [Repel](/Repel "Dark Souls 2 Repel").
  * Loses very little physical damage upon elemental infusion and has the highest character sheet AR of any rapier, at the cost of losing the scaling.
