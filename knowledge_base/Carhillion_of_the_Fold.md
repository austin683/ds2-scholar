### Carhillion of the Fold Dialogue

**\- When first met in No-Man's Wharf, with INT under 8**  
Hmm…  
I see light, but it remains dim…  
I am Carhillion, and I've no interest in the magic-impaired.

**\- When first met in No-Man's Wharf, with INT over 8**  
Hmm…I sense power…  
Very well. From this day, you shall be my new pupil.  
I am Carhillion. Carhillion of the Fold. Surely you've heard the name?  
Now, now, do not be afraid. Let us explore the limits of sorcery.

**\- When talking to him to open the interaction menu**  
Do you seek my teachings? Very well, very well.  
(or)  
Back already? Your diligence is commendable.  
(or)  
Your visit is welcome. I trust you've kept up your studies.  
(or)  
Oh, there you are. Do you seek my teachings?

**\- When leaving, having used his services**  
Young pupil, do not take my teachings lightly.

**\- When leaving, without having used his services**  
One day, my teachings will save you.

**\- When walking off without closing the menu**  
The path is yet long, young pupil.

**\- Using 'Talk' option**  
The forces of magic, and souls, lie dormant in this land.  
It is a fitting place to hone my sorceries.  
I suspect that I may even conjure up new spells here.  
Sorcery is yet a mystery, even to me. Let us mature together, young pupil.

**\- Using 'Talk' option**  
Use scrolls to unleash the power of sorceries.  
But the power of each scroll is reliant on that of its owner.  
The untrained cannot wield a scroll to its proper potential.  
Never forget, young pupil… There are no shortcuts to mastery.

**\- When leaving, in No-Man's Wharf after defeating Flexile Sentry**  
Young pupil, may we meet again, in Majula.

**\- When first met in Majula**  
Oh, so you've finally decided to join us?  
Let us resume our exploration of sorcery.

**\- Using 'Talk' option in Majula**  
Sorcery and pyromancy thrive in Melfia. I've spent much time there, trying to perfect my art.  
But staying was a mistake. The fools there had no interest in truth.  
Their ambitions were paltry, and their smiles cloying. I was sick to the back teeth of their petty squabbles.  
There was nothing for me in that forsaken land.

**\- Using 'Talk' option before rescuing Rosabeth**  
On my trip here, I met a strange girl once or twice.  
After a time, I never saw her again. I wonder where she went off to.  
We spoke only a few times, but… A fair lass, if a bit clumsy.  
I hope that she is safe.

**\- Using 'Talk' option in Majula**  
I sense a dark power here.  
Something akin to sorcery… Only more…primordial…  
I wish to find out more about it, but as we see, this place is in ruins.  
Just what happened here?

**\- Using 'Talk' option in Majula**  
Sorcery was created long, long ago.  
Some say it was originated by the great pale being…  
But we've no way of knowing if such claims are true.  
Many sorceries were lost over the ages.  
Before pyromancy, there were fire sorceries, but they are long forgotten.

**\- Using 'Talk' option after Rosabeth moves to Majula**  
So, the girl's been here too.  
I'm glad to see her safe, whatever that's worth.

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
Ah, here, a fitting gift for you.  
Seek higher planes, young pupil.

**\- When attacked but not aggroed**  
Stop that!  
(or)  
Have you lost your head?  
(or)  
Damn, you bloody fool!

**\- When attacked and aggroed**  
The arrogance of the young!

**\- When killing the player**  
How very tragic…

**\- When re-encountered after aggroing**  
Behold my true power.

**\- When attacked and health is under 50%**  
Hmph! How very sporting!

**\- When killed**  
(scream of death; no subtitle)
