_"Robe worn by Drangleic clerics."_

_"The clerics of Drangleic have retained their status throughout the ages, but were always at arms length from the royal family, as if their existence was little more than a formality."_

_"It is customary for clerics to wear different garb depending on their area, but the reason for this practice is unknown..._

_This is a woman's robe."_

### Location

  * [Dark Priestess](/Dark+Priestess) (located only in dragon shrine), [Merciless Roenna](/Merciless+Roenna), & [Peculiar Kindular](/Peculiar+Kindular).

### Notes

  * Part of the [Priestess Set](/Priestess+Set). 
    * Gives the same effect of the White Priest set, this is simply a female version.
  * Upgraded from [Titanite](/Titanite+Shard).
  * Also believed to be a clothing of [Aldia Warlock](/Aldia+Warlock) (especially [Merciless Roenna](/Merciless+Roenna)), if you switch the helm into [Warlock Mask](/Warlock+Mask), the colour scheme fits well.
