**Mastodon Greatshield** is a [Greatshield](/Greatshields "Dark Souls 2 Greatshields") in Dark Souls 2. **Greatshields** can be used not only to block an enemy but allows player to do **shield bash**(Great shields replaced parry ability with heavy shield bash).

     _"Shield of the Primal Knights that defend Drangleic castle. Very heavy, and has the power of lightning._

     _The brutish and mighty Primal Knights wield this shield as if it were made of paper, but to the ordinary warrior it is a chore to even hold up, owing to its great weight._

     _Whatever was created by Lord Aldia was lost with his disappearance, but the King attempted to revive these things, even if only fragments remained."_

### Acquired From:

  * Drop from [Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight") (Mastodons) in [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros") and [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle").

### Mastodon Greatshield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Does decent damage because of its additional lightning damage.
  * If infused with a Boltstone, this shield has 100 lightning resistance.
  * This shield makes the fight against [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Knight"), [Licia of Lindelt](/Licia+of+Lindelt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindelt") and [Fume Sorcerer](/Fume+Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sorcerer") almost trivial.
