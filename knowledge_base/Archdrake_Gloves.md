**Archdrake Gloves** is a **gauntlet** in Dark Souls 2.

### Archdrake Gloves Description

_"Gloves of the Archdrake sect of Lindelt._

_Little is known about the Archdrake sect_  
 _and its ancient rituals, and those who dare to indulge_  
 _their curiosity have been known to simply vanish._

_The Archdrake sect are the keepers of Lindelt's_  
 _histories, including the only record of its_  
 _foundation, a tome they have good reason to_  
 _keep hidden away. "_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Dropped by [Lindelt Cleric](/Archdrake+Priest "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Priest")

### Archdrake Gloves Notes

  * Upgraded with normal [Titanite](/titanite "Dark Souls 2 titanite").
  * The helm increases intelligence by one point.
  * Originally it was named the Dragonknight Set and the Archdrake sect of Lindelt was named Silverdrake Knights of Lindelt.
