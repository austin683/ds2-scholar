### DS2 Old Knight Greatsword Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Easier to obtain from bonfire intensity 2+
  * This greatsword does higher poise damage than any other greatsword in the game by far (50, most GS are 35). With the stone ring this weapon will stagger opponents easily.
  * The downside to this weapon is its high weight for its damage compared to other weapons fof its type, and its low durability. However, its UGS-par poise damage more than makes up for it. With this weapon, you can out perform Ultra Greatsword wielders in PvP, as you can swing faster and stagger them on every hit, even with their heavy armor. As for the durability, just keep some repair powders on hand if you plan on using it for PvE.
