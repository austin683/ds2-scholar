_"Hood worn by miracle-casting clerics. Grants slight increase to spell uses. Belonged to Licia of Lindelt._   
_Lindelt is founded upon stringent commandments. Its inhabitants often travel to distant lands for ascetic training, but more than a few of these trainees liberate themselves from Lindelt's teachings in the process"_   
_"Dress/gloves/trousers worn by miracle-casting clerics. belonged to Licia of Lindelt._   
_While its true Licia dedicated herself to miracles, its rare for anyone to pass through life without trouble. even clerics arent always who they seem."_
