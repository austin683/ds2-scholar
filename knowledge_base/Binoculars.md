**Binoculars** are a special tool item in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Binoculars** are designed for observing distant sights, a rare tool crafted in Volgen. While not useful in battle, a bit of creativity can make them quite practical. [Tools](/Tools "Dark Souls 2 Tools") are unique, reusable items which assist the player during various facets of gameplay ranging from basic communication to assisting in boss encounters.

### Dark Souls 2 Binoculars Usage

  * Equip them in a weapon slot, and use the light attack button to look through them. 
    * It is still possible to look and move around (albeit much slower) while using them.

  * The most practical use is for enabling first-person aiming for lining up projectiles. 
    * Particularly useful for sorceries and hexes whose range extends beyond that of your lock-on. Simply look through the Binoculars and line up your desired target exactly in the middle of the screen, then cast your projectile, and it should travel exactly on target.  

      * It's possible to get extra damage out of your projectiles this way, by aiming at the target's head to deal bonus headshot damage (only works on certain humanoid enemies with little to no head armor). This is applicable to any projectile, like spells, arrows, and throwables.

### Binoculars Location in Dark Souls 2

  * [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), on a ledge just off to the side of the pathway to the [Forest of Fallen Giants. ](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants")
  * The optimal way to reach these is to head towards Things Betwixt from Majula or vice versa and look towards the cliff for a drop-off area. There you will find a cleric sacred chime and a morning star on a body behind you. Following the path will lead towards a dead body with the binoculars on it.
