### DS2 Drakewing Ultra Greatsword Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5.
  * Fires off a ranged projectile attack (Two-hand Strong attack), lowering its durability by 10 points.
  * Two projectiles can be fired in a row.
  * Equipping the [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring") +2 will reduce the durability cost by half.
  * One of the two lightest Ultra Greatswords, the other being the [Zweihander](/Zweihander "Dark Souls 2 Zweihander").
  * If you plan to use the special attack often, be sure to take some [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder") or duplicate swords with you, or the [Repair](/Repair "Dark Souls 2 Repair") sorcery.
  * In melee range both the normal hit and ability will hit on the R2, hits around 900 damage (or 1600 damage with Resin) and capable of knocking down most enemies.
  * Hightly recommended to buff it with Resins and land a two handed strong attack at melee range, extremely handy for both killing bosses and PvP.
  * This can reach up to 1730 damage, which can result in **INSTANT KILL** during PvP.
  * Especially useful against [Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner") and [Guardian Dragon](/Guardian+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Guardian Dragon") if buffed with [Dark Pine Resin](/Dark+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pine Resin").
