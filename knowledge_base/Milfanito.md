**Milfanito** is an [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**.** The Milfanito are a group of mystical beings who can be encountered in several locations throughout the game, including the Shrine of Amana. They are known for their hauntingly beautiful singing voices, which have a calming and soothing effect on those who hear them. The Milfanito are said to be the sisters of the Fenito, another group of beings who serve as guardians of the undead. Despite their ethereal nature, the Milfanito are deeply connected to the world around them and offer valuable insights into the nature of the curse that plagues Drangleic.

### Milfanito Information in Dark Souls 2 

  * The Milfanito are a group of 4 sisters that sing to the Undead. They do not have individual names, and think of themselves as one entity. As their name and [Singer's Dress](/Singer%27s+Dress "Dark Souls 2 Singer%27s Dress") implies, they were given their power by Gravelord Nito of _Dark Souls_.
  * Will talk to you and reward you for helping them.
  * You **don't** need to release all three of them to allow you to access and use the altar at [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana") (after the final bonfire, [Rise of the Dead](/Rise+of+the+Dead "Dark Souls 2 Rise of the Dead")), an altar which allows you to become human _without_ using a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). However, you must not kill any of them for the door which leads to the altar to open.
  * In order to be revived by the altar, you can't have human effigies in your inventory or box. Also, dropping them does not work. I discarded all of my 73 human effigies to test it, and it worked. So, basically, you must be hollow (doesn't matter how much, I tried at many points of hollowing) and had NO human effigies at all. Also, you must have rescued the other 2 Milfanitos to use it.
  * They don't have gravestones if you have killed them. (needs confirmation)
  * Because of her rusty clothing, the second Milfanito is often mistaken for an enemy, especially when she's seen from a distance. Some players use the the hex [Affinity](/Affinity "Dark Souls 2 Affinity") which automatically chases all NPCs, and this ends up killing her accidentally. It's also possible to lock onto her like other enemies, **DO NOT** cast any homing spells on her or else you'll have to either wait till NG+ or burn a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") to respawn her so you can seek for [Aldia Warlock](/Aldia+Warlock "Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock"). You can skip [Demon of Song](/Demon+of+Song "Dark Souls 2 Demon of Song") if you visited the bonfire before though.
  * Oddly, Milfanito is listed as an enemy in the official Far Fire site, whether it's the second Milfanito or the hollow crawlers is another question.
  * If you accidentally killed the second Milfanito, using a bonfire ascetic on [Rhoy's Resting Place](/Rhoy%27s+Resting+Place "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy%27s Resting Place") bonfire will respawn her, since she's counted as an enemy instead of NPC, allowing you to save her and subsequently access the locked door at Rise of the Dead bonfire (and by extension, the Aldia Warlock)

From the Central Castle Drangleic bonfire, head down the hallway with the descending stairs until you reach a small circular room. Ride the rising platform up to find the room containing her.

### Dark Souls 2 Milfanito Trivia

  * In SotFS (needs confirmation for the original) the Amana Aberrations will have firefly like effects around them while the Milfanito sing. They are also more docile. Perhaps this is what the Milfanito refer to when they say "When we sing, the little ones dance."
  * They are singing the nameless song.
