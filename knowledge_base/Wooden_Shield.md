**Wooden Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A long wooden shield. Its face features a lion._

     _Its wooden construction makes lightweight and easy to use,  
but as a shield it's inferior to its metal counterparts."_
