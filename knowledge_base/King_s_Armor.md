_Armour of Vendrick, King of Drangleic._

_What makes a king?__Some say that it is birthright,__while others call it destiny._

_Perhaps it is not important, as long as_ _the king's name serves to unite his people._

### Location

  * Found past the Crumbled Ruins bonfire in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana), behind the door on the left, past a narrow stone bridge guarded by a [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dragonrider"). The door only opens once [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Vendrick") is defeated and the player must be in human form to unlock the door (using [Ring of the Dead](/Ring+of+the+Dead "Ring of the Dead") won't do).

### Notes

  * Part of the [King's Set](/King's+Set).
  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite).
  * Crown has the durability almost twice as high as any other item in the set.
  * Requires 14 STR and 12 DEX.
