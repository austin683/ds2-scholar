**Melfia** is a mentioned-only location in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). It was founded by sorcerers who escaped the king of Olaphis' decree long ago and is where the Melfian Magic Academy currently resides. The Academy is a place of study for both [sorceries](/Sorceries "Dark Souls 2 Sorceries") and [pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies"), making it quite unique in that regard. [Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes") however are admonished by nearly all manner of sorcerer.

### Melfia Lore

A former king launched a campaign to capture these terrors of the high seas, but rather than imprison them, forced them into hard labor at [No-man's Wharf](/No-man's+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man's Wharf"). The king of Olaphis, wracked with fear and suspicion, began to see the progenitor of the curse in anything and everything. During his reign, sorcerers in particular suffered dreadful persecution. [The Lost Bastille](/The+Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 The Lost Bastille") was turned into a prison, and was left abandoned to rot with its prisoners. The [sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry") crammed inmates of the overflowing Bastille onto a rickety ship, and cast them out to the open sea. The majority of them drowned or starved but a few hardy survivors made land to the south, and imparted their knowledge of sorcery to the people there. Olenford, revered as the father of sorcery in Melfia, sought knowledge that surpassed mankind's ken, and so ventured into the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"), and did away with his humanity. Some hold the theory that Melfian sorceries and pyromancies originated within the boundaries of Drangleic, in ages past. Though the precise origins of the Magic Academy are hazy, for over its long history, its faculty has been dissolved and reestablished at least a dozen times.

Special quartz rings are bestowed upon students of a certain standard at the Melfian Magic Academy. Pyromancer Glocken crafts various replicas, much to the dismay of the conservative old-guard faculty. Astrologists believe that magical powers can be obtained at moments of special heavenly alignment. Even the collective wisdom of the Melfian Magic Academy cannot pull magic out of the sky, but the ideas of the astrologists led to the creation of new and very useful magic devices. Sorcerers at the Melfian Magic Academy once attempted to imbue [titanite](/titanite "Dark Souls 2 titanite") with various elements, but are said to have failed. Someone must have succeeded, though; what else would explain the altered states of titanite? The Melfian Magic Academy was also able to rework an ancient sorcery into [Soul Spear Barrage](/Soul+Spear+Barrage "Dark Souls 2 Soul Spear Barrage"), it was a simple idea, but potentially highly effective. [Soul Greatsword](/Soul+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Soul Greatsword") was popular with the magic warriors of Melfia due to its similarity to swordplay. Wielding a sword and casting a sorcery are two different things, and some members of the Melfian Magic Academy view these varieties of spells such as [Magic Weapon](/Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Magic Weapon") impure. This is because the old purists of the Melfian Magic Academy view swordplay as a barbaric form of engagement. Still a rare weapon used by very few warriors was the [Sorcerer's Twinblade](/Sorcerer's+Twinblade "Dark Souls 2 Sorcerer's Twinblade") originating in Melfia that doubles as a catalyst for sorcery.

### Dialogue Related to Melfia

#### [Carhillion of the Fold](/Carhillion+of+the+Fold "Dark Souls 2 Carhillion of the Fold")

_Sorcery was created long, long ago. Some say it was originated by the great pale being… But we've no way of knowing if such claims are true. Many sorceries were lost over the ages. Before pyromancy, there were fire sorceries, but they are long forgotten._

_Sorcery and pyromancy thrive in Melfia. I've spent much time there, trying to perfect my art.__But staying was a mistake. The fools there had no interest in truth.__Their ambitions were paltry, and their smiles cloying. I was sick to the back teeth of their petty squabbles.__There was nothing for me in that forsaken land._

#### [Rosabeth of Melfia](/Rosabeth+of+Melfia "Dark Souls 2 Rosabeth of Melfia")

_I have my very own teacher. His name is Carhillion of the Fold, a famed sorcerer in Melfia, our home town. I was fascinated by sorcery! And so...! Well, he's so unique, you see... When he set out for Drangleic, I couldn't let him go alone. But we were separated...quite early on, I'm afraid.._

_Master Carhillion polished his art at one of our renowned magic academies. But he argued that the academies were terrible places to learn magic... This quite angered Master Glocken, my previous teacher..._

#### [Felkin the Outcast](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast")

_I...went to a great school in the South but... Neither sorcery nor pyromancy appealed, I...I...learned nothing...nothing at all. It...was there that I...happened upon the dark... It drew me in...the nebulous Dark...soon I was drawn to this land where Dark runs deeper than anywhere else._

_Hexes originated in...ancient times. They were once...a form of sorcery. But the practice was lost...then later rediscovered. Those devoted to hexes are a lonely lot... But nevertheless...they give their lives to their art. Such is the fate...of we practitioners of Dark..._
