**Ring of Prayer** is a [Ring](/Rings) in **Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)**. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "NG+"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

### Ring of Prayer Effects

**Durability** : 120

**Weight** : 

  * 0.5

  * Increases faith by 5

### Ring of Prayer Locations

  * Purchased from [Licia of Lendeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt) for 28000 souls.

### Notes

  * Since the ring effectively grants each of the 5 points of faith for 5,600 apiece, this ring is not cost effective until approximately lvl. 60, when the cost of each level-up begins to exceed 5,600. Once this occurs, purchasing this ring will be cheaper than paying the requisite number of souls for 5 levels.
  * Wearing this ring to increase your Faith stat to a certain threshold (typically 10 points) will not allow you to talk to NPCs that have such requirements.
