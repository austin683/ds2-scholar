**Sanctum Mace** is a **[Great Hammer](/Great+Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Great Hammers")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. **Sanctum Mace** inflicts poison with each attack, and the two-handed moveset includes lance moves. To prevent poisoning yourself, consider wearing the [Poisonbite Ring](/Poisonbite+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Poisonbite Ring"), [Ring of Resistance](/Ring+of+Resistance "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Resistance"), and high poison defense armor. Note the low durability, making the [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring") advisable for extended use. 

> A mace wielded by sanctum soldiers.   
>   
>  This mace was corrupted by poison when Sinh, the sleeping dragon, awoke.   
>   
>  A mere mortal would be asphyxiated by the poison emitted when wielding this, but for the noxious sanctum soldiers, this fact matters none. 

### How to get Sanctum Mace in DS2

  * Located on a body in [Shulva, Sanctum City](/Shulva+-+Sanctum+City "Dark Souls 2 Shulva - Sanctum City") near the Tower of Prayer (second bonfire)
  * Dropped from [Sanctum Soldiers](/Sanctum+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier") in [Shulva, Sanctum City](/Shulva+-+Sanctum+City "Dark Souls 2 Shulva - Sanctum City") (Crown of the sunken king DLC)

### DS2 Sanctum Mace Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite"). Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * This mace poisons the player with each attack
  * The two-handed moveset also includes some of the lance moveset, the first R1, the second R2, and the running attack are all lances moveset.
  * It is recommended to wear the [Poisonbite Ring](/Poisonbite+Ring#fex "Dark Souls 2 Poisonbite Ring#fex") and/or the [Ring of Resistence](/Ring+of+Resistance#fex "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Resistance#fex") in combination with high poison defence armor to prevent poisoning yourself
  * Wearing above rings together with the [Shadow Set](/Shadow+Set#fex "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Set#fex") and [Yorgh's Spear](/Yorgh%27s+Spear#fex "Dark Souls 2 Yorgh%27s Spear#fex") fully negates the poison damage taken by the sanctum mace.
  * The mace can be buffed with [Rotten Pine Resin](/Rotten+Pine+Resin#fex "Dark Souls 2 Rotten Pine Resin#fex"), thus infusing the weapon with poison is not recommended.
  * This weapon has extremely low durability for a weapon of its class. In addition, having poison buildup when you attack seems to drain even more of the durability. This makes it very hard to make proper use of it without the [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring")
