One of the first covenants you're able to join in **Dark Souls 2** , The **Way of the Blue** , also referred to as "the covenant of the meek", is a co-op covenant that allows Blue Sentinels, wearing the Guardian's Seal, to summon themselves to your world automatically when you are being invaded, in order to protect you. This covenant is mostly aimed towards players who have trouble beating invaders or just like to have some added security. (The question must be asked whether it is the covenant victim who is meek or the invader who invades and kills someone who is unable to defend themselves, but suspiciously the meme labels of meekness only apply to people who use teamwork to repel aggression.)  

**Covenant Leader** : [Crestfallen Saulden](/Crestfallen%C2%A0Saulden "Dark Souls 2 Crestfallen%C2%A0Saulden")   
**Where to Join** : [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula")

## How to Join Way of the Blue

As soon as you reach [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), you can head up the hill past the [bonfire](/bonfire "Dark Souls 2 bonfire"), towards a large monument structure. [Crestfallen Saulden](/Crestfallen+Saulden "Dark Souls 2 Crestfallen Saulden") is sitting in front of it, and he will invite you to join the covenant upon exhausting his dialogue. [Crestfallen Saulden](/Crestfallen+Saulden "Dark Souls 2 Crestfallen Saulden") will give the player a [Blue Seal](/Blue+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Blue Seal") upon joining the covenant. This ring slightly increases the wearer's HP, so it can also be useful for people who plan to join a different covenant later. It's **NOT** necessary to equip this ring in order to summon [Blue Sentinels](/Blue+Sentinels "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinels") to aid you. 

### Rank

Ranks are obtained by killing invaders. You do not need to wear the covenant ring to acquire rank score.
    
    
    | Rank | Requirement | Rewards |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0 | Initial | Blue Seal |
    | 1 | Defeat one invading phantom | Bloodbite Ring |
    | 2 | Defeat 5 invading phantoms | Hush |
    | 3 | Defeat 10 invading phantoms | Blue Tearstone Ring |
    

### Notes, Hints and Tips

  * Defeating invading NPC phantoms that show an invasion notice counts toward rank requirements as well.
  * Summoning an invader yourself via a [Red Soapstone](/Red+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 Red Sign Soapstone") sign or a Dragon Eye and defeating them does **NOT** count. 
  * Blue invaders, aka Arbiter invaders, do **NOT** count toward rank score.
  * Bell Keepers, also known as grey phantoms, do **NOT** count towards rank.
  * All of the items you get by gaining ranks in this covenant can be found or acquired somewhere else as well.
  * After patch 1.0.4 you do not need to wear the [Blue Seal](/Blue+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Blue Seal") to summon Blue Sentinels.
  * If your Blue Sentinel protector dies, another (or the same) will be summoned as long as the invader is still present in your world.
