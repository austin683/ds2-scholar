I don't know who you are…But leave me be.  
The frailty…of the weak… Disrupts the Dark…

**\- When talking again, with INT and FTH under 8**  
Leave me alone.  
I am interested in one thing. Dark. You haven't the gift.

**\- When first met, with INT and FTH above 8**  
The Dark stirs…  
I see…The Dark has sparked within you…  
My name is Felkin.  
I will trade with you. What do you need?

**\- When talking to open interaction menu**  
You are…always welcome…yes…?  
(or)  
The Dark…watches over you…

Come again…as you like…  
The Dark…Is always within you…

**\- When leaving, without having used his services**  
No matter…the time will come…

**\- When walking off without closing the menu**  
Till we meet again.

**\- Use 'Talk' options**  
This land…lies closest to the Dark… Th-that is…that is why I came here.  
This kingdom…collapsed long ago.  
All that are left… Are either Undead or Hollow…  
Save a few misfits like myself…hah hah.

**\- Use 'Talk' options**  
I w-went…I went…I went to a great school…in the south… But neither sorcery nor pyromancy appealed…I…  
I-I learned nothing…nothing at all… I-it was there that I happened upon the Dark.  
It drew me in… The nebulous Dark…  
Soon, I was drawn to this land, where Dark runs deeper than anywhere else.

**\- Use 'Talk' options**  
Hexes originated in…ancient times.  
They were once…a form of sorcery. But the practice was lost…then later rediscovered.  
Those devoted to hexes are a lonely lot… But nevertheless…they give their lives to their art.  
Such is the fate…of we practitioners of Dark…

**\- Use 'Talk' options**  
What drew me to the Dark…I…I…I do not know.  
Hexes are…are more than mere tools to me…  
I feel affinity…and warmth… Something universal, nostalgia…even…  
Those who discover Dark…realize this… And…they never come back.

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
These…are for you…  
Together, into the Dark…

**\- When attacked but not aggroed**  
Hrk…

What are you doing?  
(or)  
Stop this.

One day…I will share your fate.

**\- When re-encountered after aggroing**  
I cannot…let you have this.

**\- When attacked and health is under 50%**  
Ahhhh…ahh…my…my…Dark

**\- When killed**  
Look…the Dark…I see it…I see it…

**\- Unknown**  
Dark…Deliver me…
