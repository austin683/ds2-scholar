**Engraved Gauntlets** are a pair of [Gauntlets](/Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Gauntlets") in **Dark Souls 2.**

_Stone gauntlets engraved with odd writing. Said to bring good fortune to the wearer._   
 _The wealthy merchant Fiorenza searched for these rare and precious gauntlets his entire life, but was not the one who found them._

_Effect: Rare chance normal attacks become critical hits._

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Found in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"), in a chest behind an outer wooden and inner locked door just before crystal mine. The inner door is unlocked with [Tseldora Den Key](/Tseldora+Den+Key "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Den Key") received after helping either [Mild Mannered Pate ](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate")or [Creighton the Wanderer.](/Creighton+the+Wanderer "Dark Souls 2 Creighton the Wanderer") Note that helping neither of the two will prevent you from obtaining the key and will then lock you out of receiving this item. The outer door, when interacted with, makes the message "Too heavy to open" appear, you have to break the door by attacking it, be aware this will damage you and **will** kill you if your [HP](/HP "Dark Souls 2 HP") is low enough.

### Engraved Gauntlets Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Gauntlets offer the highest petrification resistance and second highest curse resistance.
  * Effect: rare chance (5%) that normal attacks become critical hits (with 1.5x damage). A distinctive sound is heard when it happens.
  * Notes:  

    * Gauntlets are compatible with bows, crossbows, spells, backstabs, ripostes, consumable throwing items, and even guard breaks (although no extra damage is applied in this case).
    * Counter damage WILL be applied to the attacks (assuming the attack that procs the effect is a counter) which can deal borderline ridiculous damage when combined with [Old Leo Ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring") and a thrusting weapon with high counter damage modifier, such as [Espada Ropera](/Espada+Ropera "Dark Souls 2 Espada Ropera") or [Shadow Dagger](/Shadow+Dagger "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Dagger").
    * Gauntlets have great synergy with items that hit more than once or quickly such as curved swords or [Channeler's Trident](/Channeler's+Trident "Dark Souls 2 Channeler's Trident").
    * Gauntlets also combine well with [Vanquisher's Seal](/Vanquisher%27s+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Vanquisher%27s Seal"), resulting in more than 800 barehand damage with 2 handed strong attack with every critical hit.
    * Gauntlets are often used in pvp as that crit could be the deciding factor of the fight.
