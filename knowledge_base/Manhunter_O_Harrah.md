#  ManHunter O'Harrah    
  

  * ManHunter O'Harrah is an NPC you can summon in the Iron Keep.
  * She wields an [Alonne Greatbow](/Alonne+Greatbow "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Greatbow"), with [Fire Great Arrows](/Fire+Greatarrow "Dark Souls 2 Fire Greatarrow"), and a [Light Crossbow](/Light+Crossbow "Dark Souls 2 Light Crossbow"), with [Magic Darts](/Ammunition "Dark Souls 2 Ammunition").
  * Her ranged attacks are effective against the Old Iron King, but this will focus the boss' aggro on her, resulting in O'Harrah being easily thrown into the lava.
