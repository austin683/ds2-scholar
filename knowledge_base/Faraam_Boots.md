**Faraam Boots** is a **legging** and a part of [Faraam Set](/Faraam+Set "Dark Souls 2 Faraam Set") in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Faraam Boots Description

     _"Boots worn by the Forossa Lion Knights._

     _The mighty Lion Knights, worshippers of the war god Faraam, wore heavy armor and were feared for their nimble two-handed swordplay._

     _But their legacy was cut short with the fall of Forossa."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * When you proceed from the kings gate bonfire,In [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") Make a right and head into the great hall with the petrified spear men, kill the ones at the top left corner to expose a room with a sentinel, a piece of the floor inside the room will collapse, exposing a cave, which includes a bonfire, and after landing a corpse containing the Faraam set will be directly behind you.  
**Notes:**  

    * Before obtaining this armor, in the room with the stone soldiers and the doors, each door except for the nearest right (from bonfire) contains a sentinel.
    * When obtaining this armor, there is a large chance that the sentinel will follow you into the cave, if this happens, you can fight it, or run into one of the two rooms attached to hide. (you can still attack it while hiding if you don't want to risk anything)

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite Shard, Large Titanite, Titanite Chunk, Titanite Slab](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores")
