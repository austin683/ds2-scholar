**Slumbering Dragon Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _Shield of the Archdrake sect of Lindelt. Represents a slumbering dragon, and is intended for use in covert rituals. Recovers stamina._

     _The fools who woke the slumbering dragon earned not only its ire, but also the destruction of an entire country._

     _The survivors buried their wrongdoings in the past, and in a show of terrible conceit, attempted to make amends by carrying on the knowledge of the wasted land.  
  
Effect: stamina recovery. _(Sotfs) 

### Acquired From

  * Rare drop from [Archdrake Pilgrims](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana").

### Slumbering Dragon Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * When farming for shield, best to travel to Shrine of Amana: Rhoy's Resting Place. Kill off the bug in front of you, and to the right. Use a great bow (or any type of range), with Covetous Gold Serpent Ring, and snipe out the 3 Archdrake (Knight or Caster) enemies standing by the cave entrance. Repeat and rest to continue farming.

  * Shield gives a passive %5 Stamina Regen.
  * Stamina Regen stacks with both [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom") and [Chloranthy Ring](/Chloranthy+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Chloranthy Ring") variants.
  * Infusing with Bleed and Poison seemed to raise the Lightning Scaling to S without decreasing base damage, decent for bashing if you have stamina boosting rings, items and equipment.
  * Stamina regeneration gained by using the shield does not offset the stamina regeneration loss of having the shield equipped. 
    * Tested with 60.2 Max Equip load and 42 equip weight (69.77%). 35.51 regen with the Shield equipped, 36.49 without the shield equipped. 
      * Note that it scales with max equip load and equipped weight, meaning that if you had 99 vitality and very light things you would see a benefit to stamina regenerating.
