### DS2 Ivory Warrior Ring Tips and Notes

  * If you get killed (e.g. by the white phantom) after killing the [White Covetous Demon](/Covetous+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Demon") without picking up the Ivory Warrior Ring, the ring will despawn.
  * DLC [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King").
  * It gives a flat bonus of 20 stamina damage to every attack.
  * Because of the flat bonus, a dagger's R1 and an ultra weapon's R1 will get the same +20 stamina damage bonus, so it is more efficient to use the ring with a fast weapon to drain enemy stamina.
  * It is particularly efficient with weapons that do damage multiple times in one attack (Twinblades, Ricard's Rapier R2, Channeler's Trident, Lances, attacks with spin moves...), some spells (Soul Barrage, Focus Souls, Fire Whip...), because it adds a 20 stamina damage bonus to each little attack, even to chip damage. For example one Twinblade's R1 does 3 hits, so the ring will add 60 extra stamina damage.
  * The flat bonus completely ignores shield stability, making it particularly powerful against players with greatshields.
  * The stamina drain of Hexes is buffed by this ring even if the enemy is not blocking.
  * Attacks that are also affected: ranged weapons, shield bash, guard break (naturally does 0 stamina damage, now 20), jumping/running/rolling attacks...
  * Consumables are unaffected by this ring. (not even Dragon Head Stone)
  * Some spells that receive a significant boost by the ring (x2-x3 their normal stamina damage): Soul Barrage, Soul Shower, Soul Bolt/Focus Souls, Soul Vortex, Fire Whip, Dark Hail, Recollection, Dark Dance, some AoE spells.
  * Some spells that are unaffected by the ring: Affinity, Homing (Crystal) Soulmass, Immolation
