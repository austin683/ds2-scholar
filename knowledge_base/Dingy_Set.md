**Dingy Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
_"An unassuming dingy hood/robe/cuffs._   
_Although by now gray with soot and nearly unraveled, its fabric was originally a pure white"_   
_"An unassuming dingy skirt. Originally pure white._   
_A close inspection reveals old dried blood. What tragedy could have befallen its original owner?"_

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by dark spirit Firekeeper found at the bottom of [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Grave of Saints") on NG+ (along with dark spirit [Faraam Knight](/Faraam+Knight+Phantom "Faraam Knight")).
  * Only obtainable in true NG+, using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic) won't do.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Titanite").
  * Found in +5 state.
  * Robe offers the highest petrification resistance and third highest curse resistance.
  * Skirt offers the highest petrification and curse resistance.
  * When fully upgraded, the skirt is arguably the best lightweight leg attire in the game.
