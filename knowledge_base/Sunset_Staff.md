**Sunset Staff** is a **[Staff](/Staves "Dark Souls 2 Staves")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Sunset Staff **is a powerful staff used for casting [Sorceries](/Sorceries "Dark Souls 2 Sorceries") and [Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes"), particularly known for its effectiveness with [Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes"). You can obtain the **Sunset Staff** from [Felkin the Outcast](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast") in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman's+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman's Copse").

> A staff said to have been forged in Aldia. A catalyst for sorceries and hexes. Particularly powerful for casting hexes.   
>   
>  The mysterious Lord Aldia secluded himself inside a manor to conduct various experiments. Those invited to the manor disappeared, replaced over time with malformed beasts that roamed its halls. 

### How to get Sunset Staff in Dark Souls 2

  * Given by [Felkin the Outcast](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast"), in Huntsman's Copse, if your INT and FTH are both 20+. Talk to him and exhaust his conversation path, and he will give you the staff and the Hexer's Set (If your INT and FTH isn't high enough then use a soul vessel to respec your stats so your INT and FTH are 20+ and then use another soul vessel to change back your stats).
  * Outside [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep") left to the stairs there is an iron chest (mimic) containing another staff. This one is also useful if you want to complete Royal Sorcerer Navlaan's questline without actually killing Felkin when you do not have the required INT and FTH to obtain his staff. _Note: The mimic does not drop the staff in SotFS_

### DS2 Sunset Staff Hints and Tips

  * The best staff for hex damage, especially infused with Dark.
  * The only downside is its casting speed is somewhat slow, as well as its relatively low durability compared with other catalysts.
  * If you want to seek for a faster Hex dedicated catalyst, try [Witchtree Branch](/Witchtree+Branch "Dark Souls 2 Witchtree Branch") or equip a [Clear Bluestone Ring](/Clear+Bluestone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Clear Bluestone Ring") to cope with the cast speed.
