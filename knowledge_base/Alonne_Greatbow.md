###  **Acquired From**

  * Rare drop from [Alonne Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain) in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep)
  * Rare drop from [Alonne Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain) in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle)
  * An Alonne Greatbow +5 can be found in the [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King) DLC area. Backtrack from the [Foyer](/Foyer) bonfire. Once out of the Foyer, go down the stairs and walk down the giant chain connected to the cursed tower. The Alonne Greatbow +5 can be found on a circular platform with an enemy. Make a jump from to circular stairs to the platform in order to reach the item.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * As all Greatbows, every shot requires a large amount of stamina, but inflicts great knock-back and singular damage.
  * Slightly faster rate of fire and lower stamina cost than the [Dragonslayer Greatbow.](/Dragonslayer+Greatbow)
