### Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Medal Notes and Tips

  * Co-Op hotspots: 
    * Early-game: [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant") or the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer"). Note that this means you must first rush your way through Heide's Tower of Flame to beat the [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider"),fight through the [Skeleton Lords](/Skeleton+Lords "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton Lords") at the Huntsman's Copse to get to the Harvest Valley and then access the Covenant. You may also want the [Agape Ring](/Agape+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Agape Ring") from [Straid](/Straid "Dark Souls 2 Straid") at the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille") to keep your Soul Memory from going too high.
    * Another lucrative area for medals is in Huntsmans Copse, at the Bridge Approach bonfire, most players are happy to have a hand for the Undead Chariot boss fight (and the trip there.) Typically short wait times for summoning.
    * Late-game: [Guardian Dragon](/Guardian+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Guardian Dragon"), or Throne of Want (especially if you find players taking on the Throne Watcher/Defender, Nashandra, and Aldia all in sequence
    * DLC: [Sir Alonne](/Sir+Alonne "Dark Souls 2 Sir Alonne"), [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight"), and [Burnt Ivory King](/Burnt+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Burnt Ivory King"). For the last of these, take the opportunity to farm [Loyce Souls](/Loyce+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Soul") too.
  * You cannot drop these with a phantom present (need confirmation, got one from a Banedigger while a white phantom was present in my world).
  * Another another easy way to farm those is to equip Soul Appease and either Profound Still or Promised Walk of Peace once you do it warp to the first bonfire of tseldora and come up to the fence and cast [Profound Still](/profound+still "Dark Souls 2 profound still") or [Promised Walk of Peace](/Promised+Walk+of+Peace "Dark Souls 2 Promised Walk of Peace") and the Falconers will rush at you and then you can cast Soul Appease and easily kill the 3 closest Falconers.
