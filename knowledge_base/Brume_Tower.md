### Brume Tower Walkthrough

### Access

To commence this quest, head to the primal bonfire in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") and examine the obelisk that is in the room after the bonfire, to be teleported to a new area. When you arrive, you will see some stairs going up and a room on either side. The side rooms can be accessed by players without the DLC, they can place their summon signs there and be summoned into the [Iron Passage](/Iron+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron Passage") or the [Memory of the Old Iron King](/Memory+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the Old Iron King") (random). Head up the stairs and open the big door with the [Heavy Iron Key](/Heavy+Iron+Key "Dark Souls 2 Heavy Iron Key").

Straight ahead you'll find an elevator that you can call using the lever on the right. Get on and ride it up to the fog gate. Pass through it and continue right, up some stairs, until you reach the remains of an Ashen Idol holding 6x [Smelter Wedges](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge"). Loot it then continue up the chain to reach the **Brume Tower** , and find the **[Throne Floor Bonfire](/Throne+Floor "Dark Souls 2 Throne Floor")**.

### Ashen Encounters

As soon as you reach an ash covered area after the stairs, an [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol") will emerge. It will blow up and cause several fire pillars to erupt around it. So once you see it surface, retreat to a safe distance and let it throw its flame tantrum before approaching it and using a [Smelter Wedge](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge") to destroy it and pick up the [Soul of Nadalia, Bride of Ash (fragment)](/Soul+of+Nadalia%2C+Bride+of+Ash+%28fragment%29 "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Nadalia%2C Bride of Ash %28fragment%29") it leaves behind. _NOTE_ : Be sure to keep at least one [Smelter Wedge](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge") to bring to the boss fight, as you'll need one to disable the Idol that constantly heals the boss.

Go down the stairs on the left side to find a [Dexterity Ring](/Dexterity+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Dexterity Ring"). Head back up take the first doorway on the right to travel down another flight of stairs until you reach a suspended elevator. Drop onto it and pick up 2x [Old Growth Balm](/Old+Growth+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Old Growth Balm") on the corpse, before dropping down again. Continue through the doorway and down to another ash field. This time, an [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") will emerge from the ground. Deal with him then pick up 2x [Twilight Herb](/Twilight+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Twilight Herb") on the cliff next to you. Destroy all ash figures in the area and pickup a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight") from the last one. Down the ramp and awaits a fight against a group of [Ashen Warrio**rs**](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior"). After you kill all 4, check on the right of the stairs for a corpse containing a [Rouge Water](/Rouge+Water "Dark Souls 2 Rouge Water").

Back to the main route, proceed through the doorway and down the ladder. Around the structure, you'll find a [Blackweed Balm](/Blackweed+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Blackweed Balm"), pick it up before proceeding down the next ladder. At the bottom, you'll find a corpse holding a [Scythe+7](/Scythe "Dark Souls 2 Scythe"). Continue through the doorway and you'll find 10x [Prism Stone](/Prism+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Prism Stone") on a corpse .   
Keep going down that hallway to arrive at a chest containing a [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab").

### Upper Floor Bonfire

You'll find a ladder that leads down to a big room with an [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol") in the center, surrounded by some **Ashen Warriors**. The [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol") will continue to buff the [Ashen Warrior**s**](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior"), if not destroyed. On the right there's a room with 2 more **Ashen Warriors** guarding a corpse holding the [Pyromancy: Dance of Fire](/Dance+of+Fire "Dark Souls 2 Dance of Fire"). In the main room, destroy the idol for another [Soul of Nadalia, Bride of Ash (fragment)](/Soul+of+Nadalia%2C+Bride+of+Ash+%28fragment%29 "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Nadalia%2C Bride of Ash %28fragment%29"), to make taking on the enemies in this room easier. At the end of the room, a lever on the left can be used to open the metal door. Go through the door and turn left.

[Ashen Warrior**s**](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") will emerge from the ash. Make quick work of them before destroying the ash figures in the area to acquire 2x [Old Mundane Stone](/Old+Mundane+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Old Mundane Stone") from the last one. Once done, continue down until you reach a body holding 5x [Lloyd's Talisman](/Lloyd%27s+Talisman "Dark Souls 2 Lloyd%27s Talisman") on a cliff. Across the body you'll find an illusory wall that you can uncover by pressing the "use" button on it. Through it, you'll find two chests, one containing 4x [Old Radiant Lifegem](/Old+Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Old Radiant Lifegem") and 4x [Wilted Dusk Herb](/Wilted+Dusk+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Wilted Dusk Herb"), while the holds 2x [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel").

Go back up right of the doorway this time. Open the metal door on the right at the end of the patio and enter the room where you'll find 3 **Barrel Carriers** , which passive until provoked; be careful if you choose to provoke them, as they are explosive and a fire sources are not far off wherever these buggers are. Whether you've chosen to take them out or not, proceed down the ladder on the left. Continue down the stairs and you'll find a corpse holding 2x [Goldenfruit Balm](/Goldenfruit+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Goldenfruit Balm"), at the bottom . A [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor") will attack here as well, kill it to continue forward to find another fire-spouting statue and several **Barrel Carriers** around it.

Go down the ladder, kill the [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") there and go down the next ladder. 2 more [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") will be waiting there, kill them and open the wooden chest on the right for a [Caestus+8](/Caestus "Dark Souls 2 Caestus"). Enter the doorway and on the right you will find the **[Upper Floor Bonfire](/Upper+Floor "Dark Souls 2 Upper Floor")**. _BEWARE_ : This area is riddled with [Invader Prowlers](/Prowlers "Dark Souls 2 Prowlers"), so be ready for a handful of surprise fights against red-glowing foes.

### Big Boy Bomb

Continue in the same direction to arrive at a metal door that doesn't open from this side so turn left and loot the wooden chest for 3x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). Return to then past the bonfire, follow the right path and find a fog gate. Head left into an alcove, walled by metal bars, to find a ladder in a corner. At the bottom of the ladder you'll find a **Barrel Carrier** standing by a metal trap door. Ignore it for now and turn right when exiting the alcove to arrive at a pile of dead bodies and a metal door. On the other side of this door, you'll find 3 more **Barrel Carriers** and a covered hole in the floor. 3x [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem") can be found by the ladder at the end of the room.

Now before you make the descend down that ladder, be wary of the several [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") and [Iron Warrior](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior") that await at the bottom. A good strategy to employ here is to herd the Barrel Carriers down the ladder and blow them up to clear some of the enemies before proceeding down. Either way, they've all been defeated, use a [Smelter Wedge](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge") on the [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol") and pick up another [Soul of Nadalia, Bride of Ash (fragment)](/Soul+of+Nadalia%2C+Bride+of+Ash+%28fragment%29 "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Nadalia%2C Bride of Ash %28fragment%29") and a [Flame Quartz Ring +3](/Flame+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flame Quartz Ring") from the body near the ladder. Down here you'll also find a giant metal door that you'll need to proceed through, and can be opened by pulling the nearby lever -do so.

### Foyer Bonfire

At the bottom of the first set of steps, a [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor") will rise and attack you, next to a couple of corpses. Defeat it and claim the following loot from the bodies:

  * 5x [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard")
  * 1x [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy")
  * 2x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")
  * 1x [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root")

Continue down the path until you reach 2 [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior"), and a [Fume Sorcerer](/Fume+Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sorcerer") on the cliff. As you approach the sorcerer, another couple of [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") will emerge from the ground. _TIP_ : whenever you see a [Fume Sorcerer](/Fume+Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sorcerer"), always try to rush them first, or take them out at range, before going in. There is also a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") on the corpse next to the sorcerer. If you continue in the same direction, you'll encounter more [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") and another [Fume Sorcerer](/Fume+Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sorcerer"). Go down the ladder at the end and kill the 3 [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") nearby.

To the left you will see a big ash field with many ash figures. In here, 2 [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") will emerge and try to ambush you from the wall on the left. After you kill them, destroying all the figures grants you 2x [Soul of a Great Hero](/Soul+of+a+Great+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Great Hero") and a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight"). Return to the ladder and this time, head down the stairs ahead to exit the building then continue around on the left. Pick a [Raw Stone](/Raw+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Raw Stone") from the corpse then return to the ladder and hug the left side of the stairs while approaching it. Once you reach the end of the stairs, do a 180 to the left and proceed here to find a fog gate. Go down the stairs continue right, past the locked iron door, to find the **[Foyer](/Foyer "Dark Souls 2 Foyer") bonfire**.

### Iron Scepter

Follow the path past the bonfire and you'll find a body with 2x [Magic Stone](/Magic+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Magic Stone") on the right. From here, turn right and take the ladder down to continue into the next area. Pull the lever at the end near the metal bars. In this area there will be many flame spitting heads, remember that you could move them by hitting them with sword or arrows. This is useful in toning down health of sorcerers or Iron Warriors, or blasting barrel carriers near them. Kill the sorcerer after the flame spitting head. Behind the sorcerer is a breakable wall with a chest, the chest contains 8x [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"), the wall can only be broken by exploding a **Barrel Carrier**. Pull the next lever and kill the sorcerer nearby, run/roll by the flame spitting statue and kill the other two sorcerers, behind these two is another breakable wall that has a chest holding [Catarina Leggings and Gauntlets](/Catarina+Set "Dark Souls 2 Catarina Set"); again, blow it up using a Barrel Carrier. Further down the path is another lever and an [Iron Warrior](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior").

After killing the warrior, pull that lever and the other lever next to it. Head outside and turn left into a small doorway, at the end turn left into a small room and go up the ladder. Pull the lever to open a shortcut to the previous bonfire and pick up a [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root"). Go back and cross the chain on the left. Enter the fog gate and kill the 5 [Ashen Crawlers](/Ashen+Crawler "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Crawler") in that hallway. In the end of the corridor there is a body with 2x [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). Go through the doorway and down the ladder. You will be invaded by the NPC [Quicksword Rachel](/Quicksword+Rachel "Dark Souls 2 Quicksword Rachel"), she will be waiting at the bottom of the ladder. Kill her and open the metal doors.

Two [Ashen Crawlers](/Ashen+Crawler "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Crawler") will be waiting behind each door. Behind one door are 2 bodies that hold 2x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") and the hex [Recollection](/Recollection "Dark Souls 2 Recollection"), a [Fume Sorcerer](/Fume+Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sorcerer") will appear after you pick up the items. One of the door will lead to a ladder, go down that ladder and keep following the path until you reach another metal door, open it and 6 [Ashen Crawlers](/Ashen+Crawler "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Crawler") will be guarding the [Scorching Iron Scepter](/Scorching+Iron+Scepter "Dark Souls 2 Scorching Iron Scepter"). Try and use some alluring skulls to get them to kill each other for you. If you can't bait them into fratercide, do a suicide run to grab the scepter.

### Tower Key

Go through the doorway on the right, kill the Ashen Crawler and follow the path and pull the lever to activate the elevator. When the elevator comes down, kill the [Ashen Crawler](/Ashen+Crawler "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Crawler") that is on it, step on the elevator and go up. Cross the corridor and drop down he hole on the left. Go out and cross the chain again and go all the way back to the bonfire (use a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone") or the [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") to speed up the process).

Go to the structure in the middle of the room and use the [Scorching Iron Scepter](/Scorching+Iron+Scepter "Dark Souls 2 Scorching Iron Scepter"). This will activate the elevators in this room. In one of the corners of the room, you'll find a body that holds a [Spell Quartz Ring +3](/Spell+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Spell Quartz Ring"). Go down the elevator near the Sceptre, enter the doorway on the left and ignore the barrel carriers there, you will see an ash field. Three [Iron Warriors](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior") will emerge from the ash. Kill them and destroy all the ash figures. Pick up the loot from corpses and figures for a total of:

  * 1x [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier")
  * 2x [Titanite Chunk](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk")
  * 1x [Wilted Dusk Herb](/Wilted+Dusk+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Wilted Dusk Herb")
  * [Tower Key](/Tower+Key "Dark Souls 2 Tower Key")
  * 5x [Charcoal Pine Resin](/Charcoal+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Charcoal Pine Resin")
  * 2x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")
  * 2x [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy")
  * 1x [Skeptic's Spice](/Skeptic%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic%27s Spice").

Go back to where you exited the elevator to use the [Tower Key](/Tower+Key "Dark Souls 2 Tower Key") on the locked door in front of it. Follow the path and go down the stairs. On the right you'll find a body holding 2x [Twilight Herb](/Twilight+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Twilight Herb"). The elevator there will take you down to an optional area, the [Iron Passage](/Iron+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron Passage").

### Knight is Fuming

Go back to the **Foyer Bonfire** and take the elevator right in front of it to go down. Step out at the bottom and go right to the next elevator going down. When it stops, don't step out, wait for it to start going up again and jump/roll to the platform above. Follow that path into a room where you'll find a chest containing a [Strength Ring](/Strength+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Strength Ring") on the left.

Drop down the hole and kill the [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") there. Drop down the next hole and be careful not to step on the patched ground, or you will go down a few levels of patched grounds and die at the bottom. This floor has only one [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior"), with the next floor having two, and the subsequent floor only holding one. The one after is clear but the one after that will hold two more -in this same floor there is a body holding a [Partizan +6](/Partizan "Dark Souls 2 Partizan"). The final floor will contain an [Iron Warrior](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior").

After killing him, pull the lever to open the big metal door and you'll encounter a [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor"), on the other side. Killing it will cause another to emerge from the ground. After dealing with them, you will encounter another [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") and find two doorways.

  * Right - In here, you'll find the [Sorcery Clutch Ring](/Sorcery+Clutch+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Sorcery Clutch Ring").
  * Left - In here, you'll find an elevator that takes you down to a large field and a fog gate.

Don't enter the mist yet. Instead, head right to face two [Iron Warriors](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior") back to back. Deal with them then continue on until you see a bonfire on the right. Light the **[Lowermost Floor Bonfire](/Lowermost+Floor "Dark Souls 2 Lowermost Floor")** then now destroy the 4 [Ashen Idols](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol") with [Smelter Wedges](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge"). If you don't destroy them, they will keep healing the boss that is inside that structure. At this point, consider doing the optional stuff listed below. Now enter the fog and face the big boy.

BOSS FIGHT: [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight")

After killing this boss enter the small room and examine the petrified body to obtain the [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King Helm"). After killing the [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight"), you can explore the two optional areas, the [Iron Passage](/Iron+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron Passage") and the [Memory of the Old Iron King](/Memory+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the Old Iron King").

### Optional Content in Brume Tower

  * The guide above focused on the essential and on loot that doesn't take the player too far away from the main objective, but Brume Tower has more areas to explore and more items to get. It's recommended to explore these areas wearing the [Hollow Skin](/Hollow+Skin "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Skin"), because two of them inflict curse and this head gear gives the player 1000 curse resist, and before killing the [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight") so other players can be summoned to help.

As soon as you step on the elevator move close to the front wall and keep pressing the "interact" button as it goes up. When it comes down an illusory wall will be open, roll into that room and open the chest that contains the [Hollow Skin](/Hollow+Skin "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Skin").   
  
**[Baneful Bird Ring](/Baneful+Bird+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Baneful Bird Ring"):** This ring is close to the first bonfire of Brume Tower, but its only reachable after the [Scorching Iron Scepter](/Scorching+Iron+Scepter "Dark Souls 2 Scorching Iron Scepter") has been placed near the Foyer bonfire. Teleport to the first bonfire and look around, you will see a body with an item and a blocked path. Now that the elevators are working wait for the elevator nearby to come up and jump/roll to it. From the elevator walk to the landing where the body is and pick up the ring.

At the top go right and open the door at the end.

Kill the [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor") here and make one of the Barrel Carriers go to the fire the head is spitting, the explosion will break the wall and reveal a body holding the [Dispelling Ring +1](/Dispelling+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Dispelling Ring"). Continue through this path, kill the 2 Ashen Warriors waiting on the left and the 2 [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor") at the end (again, exploding the barrels or the carriers nearby is the easiest way), in the end of this corridor on the left there is a chest that has the 4x [Smelter Wedge](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge").   
  
**[Pilgrim's Spontoon](/Pilgrim%27s+Spontoon "Dark Souls 2 Pilgrim%27s Spontoon"):** From the Upper Floor bonfire go to the circular room with the elevators.

**[Life Ring +3](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring"):** From the Upper Floor bonfire go to the circular room with the elevators. Enter the room and turn right, wait for the elevator to be on its way up and drop to it. Then quickly walk across to next ledge.

Open the chest in the end for 2x [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). Equip the [Hollow Skin](/Hollow+Skin "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Skin") before going down the stairs, since the Ashen Idol keeps this place cursed. Go down the stairs and 2 Ashen Warriors will emerge in the circular structure in the middle, and a Possessed Armor will attack you as soon as you are in range. You can't kill the Armor because of the Idol in the bottom, it will keep bringing it back to life. The best to do is to run to the bottom and destroy the idol so you can kill the enemies there. A body in the stairs at the start holds 5x [Silver Talisman](/Silver+Talisman "Dark Souls 2 Silver Talisman"). In the 2nd round structure in the middle is a body holding a [Alonne Greatbow+5](/Alonne+Greatbow "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Greatbow").

### Brume Tower Walkthrough

### Access

To commence this quest, head to the primal bonfire in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") and examine the obelisk that is in the room after the bonfire, to be teleported to a new area. When you arrive, you will see some stairs going up and a room on either side. The side rooms can be accessed by players without the DLC, they can place their summon signs there and be summoned into the [Iron Passage](/Iron+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron Passage") or the [Memory of the Old Iron King](/Memory+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the Old Iron King") (random). Head up the stairs and open the big door with the [Heavy Iron Key](/Heavy+Iron+Key "Dark Souls 2 Heavy Iron Key").

Straight ahead you'll find an elevator that you can call using the lever on the right. Get on and ride it up to the fog gate. Pass through it and continue right, up some stairs, until you reach the remains of an Ashen Idol holding 6x [Smelter Wedges](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge"). Loot it then continue up the chain to reach the **Brume Tower** , and find the **[Throne Floor Bonfire](/Throne+Floor "Dark Souls 2 Throne Floor")**.

### Ashen Encounters

As soon as you reach an ash covered area after the stairs, an [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol") will emerge. It will blow up and cause several fire pillars to erupt around it. So once you see it surface, retreat to a safe distance and let it throw its flame tantrum before approaching it and using a [Smelter Wedge](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge") to destroy it and pick up the [Soul of Nadalia, Bride of Ash (fragment)](/Soul+of+Nadalia%2C+Bride+of+Ash+%28fragment%29 "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Nadalia%2C Bride of Ash %28fragment%29") it leaves behind. _NOTE_ : Be sure to keep at least one [Smelter Wedge](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge") to bring to the boss fight, as you'll need one to disable the Idol that constantly heals the boss.

Go down the stairs on the left side to find a [Dexterity Ring](/Dexterity+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Dexterity Ring"). Head back up take the first doorway on the right to travel down another flight of stairs until you reach a suspended elevator. Drop onto it and pick up 2x [Old Growth Balm](/Old+Growth+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Old Growth Balm") on the corpse, before dropping down again. Continue through the doorway and down to another ash field. This time, an [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") will emerge from the ground. Deal with him then pick up 2x [Twilight Herb](/Twilight+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Twilight Herb") on the cliff next to you. Destroy all ash figures in the area and pickup a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight") from the last one. Down the ramp and awaits a fight against a group of [Ashen Warrio**rs**](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior"). After you kill all 4, check on the right of the stairs for a corpse containing a [Rouge Water](/Rouge+Water "Dark Souls 2 Rouge Water").

Back to the main route, proceed through the doorway and down the ladder. Around the structure, you'll find a [Blackweed Balm](/Blackweed+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Blackweed Balm"), pick it up before proceeding down the next ladder. At the bottom, you'll find a corpse holding a [Scythe+7](/Scythe "Dark Souls 2 Scythe"). Continue through the doorway and you'll find 10x [Prism Stone](/Prism+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Prism Stone") on a corpse .   
Keep going down that hallway to arrive at a chest containing a [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab").

### Upper Floor Bonfire

You'll find a ladder that leads down to a big room with an [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol") in the center, surrounded by some **Ashen Warriors**. The [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol") will continue to buff the [Ashen Warrior**s**](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior"), if not destroyed. On the right there's a room with 2 more **Ashen Warriors** guarding a corpse holding the [Pyromancy: Dance of Fire](/Dance+of+Fire "Dark Souls 2 Dance of Fire"). In the main room, destroy the idol for another [Soul of Nadalia, Bride of Ash (fragment)](/Soul+of+Nadalia%2C+Bride+of+Ash+%28fragment%29 "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Nadalia%2C Bride of Ash %28fragment%29"), to make taking on the enemies in this room easier. At the end of the room, a lever on the left can be used to open the metal door. Go through the door and turn left.

[Ashen Warrior**s**](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") will emerge from the ash. Make quick work of them before destroying the ash figures in the area to acquire 2x [Old Mundane Stone](/Old+Mundane+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Old Mundane Stone") from the last one. Once done, continue down until you reach a body holding 5x [Lloyd's Talisman](/Lloyd%27s+Talisman "Dark Souls 2 Lloyd%27s Talisman") on a cliff. Across the body you'll find an illusory wall that you can uncover by pressing the "use" button on it. Through it, you'll find two chests, one containing 4x [Old Radiant Lifegem](/Old+Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Old Radiant Lifegem") and 4x [Wilted Dusk Herb](/Wilted+Dusk+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Wilted Dusk Herb"), while the holds 2x [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel").

Go back up right of the doorway this time. Open the metal door on the right at the end of the patio and enter the room where you'll find 3 **Barrel Carriers** , which passive until provoked; be careful if you choose to provoke them, as they are explosive and a fire sources are not far off wherever these buggers are. Whether you've chosen to take them out or not, proceed down the ladder on the left. Continue down the stairs and you'll find a corpse holding 2x [Goldenfruit Balm](/Goldenfruit+Balm "Dark Souls 2 Goldenfruit Balm"), at the bottom . A [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor") will attack here as well, kill it to continue forward to find another fire-spouting statue and several **Barrel Carriers** around it.

Go down the ladder, kill the [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") there and go down the next ladder. 2 more [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") will be waiting there, kill them and open the wooden chest on the right for a [Caestus+8](/Caestus "Dark Souls 2 Caestus"). Enter the doorway and on the right you will find the **[Upper Floor Bonfire](/Upper+Floor "Dark Souls 2 Upper Floor")**. _BEWARE_ : This area is riddled with [Invader Prowlers](/Prowlers "Dark Souls 2 Prowlers"), so be ready for a handful of surprise fights against red-glowing foes.

### Big Boy Bomb

Continue in the same direction to arrive at a metal door that doesn't open from this side so turn left and loot the wooden chest for 3x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). Return to then past the bonfire, follow the right path and find a fog gate. Head left into an alcove, walled by metal bars, to find a ladder in a corner. At the bottom of the ladder you'll find a **Barrel Carrier** standing by a metal trap door. Ignore it for now and turn right when exiting the alcove to arrive at a pile of dead bodies and a metal door. On the other side of this door, you'll find 3 more **Barrel Carriers** and a covered hole in the floor. 3x [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem") can be found by the ladder at the end of the room.

Now before you make the descend down that ladder, be wary of the several [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") and [Iron Warrior](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior") that await at the bottom. A good strategy to employ here is to herd the Barrel Carriers down the ladder and blow them up to clear some of the enemies before proceeding down. Either way, they've all been defeated, use a [Smelter Wedge](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge") on the [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol") and pick up another [Soul of Nadalia, Bride of Ash (fragment)](/Soul+of+Nadalia%2C+Bride+of+Ash+%28fragment%29 "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Nadalia%2C Bride of Ash %28fragment%29") and a [Flame Quartz Ring +3](/Flame+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flame Quartz Ring") from the body near the ladder. Down here you'll also find a giant metal door that you'll need to proceed through, and can be opened by pulling the nearby lever -do so.

### Foyer Bonfire

At the bottom of the first set of steps, a [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor") will rise and attack you, next to a couple of corpses. Defeat it and claim the following loot from the bodies:

  * 5x [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard")
  * 1x [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy")
  * 2x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")
  * 1x [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root")

Continue down the path until you reach 2 [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior"), and a [Fume Sorcerer](/Fume+Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sorcerer") on the cliff. As you approach the sorcerer, another couple of [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") will emerge from the ground. _TIP_ : whenever you see a [Fume Sorcerer](/Fume+Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sorcerer"), always try to rush them first, or take them out at range, before going in. There is also a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") on the corpse next to the sorcerer. If you continue in the same direction, you'll encounter more [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") and another [Fume Sorcerer](/Fume+Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sorcerer"). Go down the ladder at the end and kill the 3 [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") nearby.

To the left you will see a big ash field with many ash figures. In here, 2 [Ashen Warriors](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") will emerge and try to ambush you from the wall on the left. After you kill them, destroying all the figures grants you 2x [Soul of a Great Hero](/Soul+of+a+Great+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Great Hero") and a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight"). Return to the ladder and this time, head down the stairs ahead to exit the building then continue around on the left. Pick a [Raw Stone](/Raw+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Raw Stone") from the corpse then return to the ladder and hug the left side of the stairs while approaching it. Once you reach the end of the stairs, do a 180 to the left and proceed here to find a fog gate. Go down the stairs continue right, past the locked iron door, to find the **[Foyer](/Foyer "Dark Souls 2 Foyer") bonfire**.

### Iron Scepter

Follow the path past the bonfire and you'll find a body with 2x [Magic Stone](/Magic+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Magic Stone") on the right. From here, turn right and take the ladder down to continue into the next area. Pull the lever at the end near the metal bars. In this area there will be many flame spitting heads, remember that you could move them by hitting them with sword or arrows. This is useful in toning down health of sorcerers or Iron Warriors, or blasting barrel carriers near them. Kill the sorcerer after the flame spitting head. Behind the sorcerer is a breakable wall with a chest, the chest contains 8x [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"), the wall can only be broken by exploding a **Barrel Carrier**. Pull the next lever and kill the sorcerer nearby, run/roll by the flame spitting statue and kill the other two sorcerers, behind these two is another breakable wall that has a chest holding [Catarina Leggings and Gauntlets](/Catarina+Set "Dark Souls 2 Catarina Set"); again, blow it up using a Barrel Carrier. Further down the path is another lever and an [Iron Warrior](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior").

After killing the warrior, pull that lever and the other lever next to it. Head outside and turn left into a small doorway, at the end turn left into a small room and go up the ladder. Pull the lever to open a shortcut to the previous bonfire and pick up a [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root"). Go back and cross the chain on the left. Enter the fog gate and kill the 5 [Ashen Crawlers](/Ashen+Crawler "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Crawler") in that hallway. In the end of the corridor there is a body with 2x [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). Go through the doorway and down the ladder. You will be invaded by the NPC [Quicksword Rachel](/Quicksword+Rachel "Dark Souls 2 Quicksword Rachel"), she will be waiting at the bottom of the ladder. Kill her and open the metal doors.

Two [Ashen Crawlers](/Ashen+Crawler "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Crawler") will be waiting behind each door. Behind one door are 2 bodies that hold 2x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") and the hex [Recollection](/Recollection "Dark Souls 2 Recollection"), a [Fume Sorcerer](/Fume+Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Fume Sorcerer") will appear after you pick up the items. One of the door will lead to a ladder, go down that ladder and keep following the path until you reach another metal door, open it and 6 [Ashen Crawlers](/Ashen+Crawler "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Crawler") will be guarding the [Scorching Iron Scepter](/Scorching+Iron+Scepter "Dark Souls 2 Scorching Iron Scepter"). Try and use some alluring skulls to get them to kill each other for you. If you can't bait them into fratercide, do a suicide run to grab the scepter.

### Tower Key

Go through the doorway on the right, kill the Ashen Crawler and follow the path and pull the lever to activate the elevator. When the elevator comes down, kill the [Ashen Crawler](/Ashen+Crawler "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Crawler") that is on it, step on the elevator and go up. Cross the corridor and drop down he hole on the left. Go out and cross the chain again and go all the way back to the bonfire (use a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone") or the [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") to speed up the process).

Go to the structure in the middle of the room and use the [Scorching Iron Scepter](/Scorching+Iron+Scepter "Dark Souls 2 Scorching Iron Scepter"). This will activate the elevators in this room. In one of the corners of the room, you'll find a body that holds a [Spell Quartz Ring +3](/Spell+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Spell Quartz Ring"). Go down the elevator near the Sceptre, enter the doorway on the left and ignore the barrel carriers there, you will see an ash field. Three [Iron Warriors](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior") will emerge from the ash. Kill them and destroy all the ash figures. Pick up the loot from corpses and figures for a total of:

  * 1x [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier")

On the right you'll find a body holding 2x [Twilight Herb](/Twilight+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Twilight Herb"). The elevator there will take you down to an optional area, the [Iron Passage](/Iron+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron Passage").

### Knight is Fuming

Go back to the **Foyer Bonfire** and take the elevator right in front of it to go down. Step out at the bottom and go right to the next elevator going down. When it stops, don't step out, wait for it to start going up again and jump/roll to the platform above. Follow that path into a room where you'll find a chest containing a [Strength Ring](/Strength+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Strength Ring") on the left.

Drop down the hole and kill the [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") there. Drop down the next hole and be careful not to step on the patched ground, or you will go down a few levels of patched grounds and die at the bottom. This floor has only one [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior"), with the next floor having two, and the subsequent floor only holding one. The one after is clear but the one after that will hold two more -in this same floor there is a body holding a [Partizan +6](/Partizan "Dark Souls 2 Partizan"). The final floor will contain an [Iron Warrior](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior").

After killing him, pull the lever to open the big metal door and you'll encounter a [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor"), on the other side. Killing it will cause another to emerge from the ground. After dealing with them, you will encounter another [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") and find two doorways.

  * Right - In here, you'll find the [Sorcery Clutch Ring](/Sorcery+Clutch+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Sorcery Clutch Ring").
  * Left - In here, you'll find an elevator that takes you down to a large field and a fog gate.

Don't enter the mist yet. Instead, head right to face two [Iron Warriors](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior") back to back. Deal with them then continue on until you see a bonfire on the right. Light the **[Lowermost Floor Bonfire](/Lowermost+Floor "Dark Souls 2 Lowermost Floor")** then now destroy the 4 [Ashen Idols](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol") with [Smelter Wedges](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge"). If you don't destroy them, they will keep healing the boss that is inside that structure. At this point, consider doing the optional stuff listed below. Now enter the fog and face the big boy.

BOSS FIGHT: [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight")

After killing this boss enter the small room and examine the petrified body to obtain the [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King Helm"). After killing the [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight"), you can explore the two optional areas, the [Iron Passage](/Iron+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron Passage") and the [Memory of the Old Iron King](/Memory+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the Old Iron King").

### Optional Content in Brume Tower

  * The guide above focused on the essential and on loot that doesn't take the player too far away from the main objective, but Brume Tower has more areas to explore and more items to get. It's recommended to explore these areas wearing the [Hollow Skin](/Hollow+Skin "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Skin"), because two of them inflict curse and this head gear gives the player 1000 curse resist, and before killing the [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight") so other players can be summoned to help.   
  
**[Hollow Skin](/Hollow+Skin "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Skin"):** After placing the [Scorching Iron Scepter](/Scorching+Iron+Scepter "Dark Souls 2 Scorching Iron Scepter") next to the Foyer bonfire, take the elevator up, step out and go to the next elevator going up.

Kill the [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor") here and make one of the Barrel Carriers go to the fire the head is spitting, the explosion will break the wall and reveal a body holding the [Dispelling Ring +1](/Dispelling+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Dispelling Ring"). Continue through this path, kill the 2 Ashen Warriors waiting on the left and the 2 [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor") at the end (again, exploding the barrels or the carriers nearby is the easiest way), in the end of this corridor on the left there is a chest that has the 4x [Smelter Wedge](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge").   
  
**[Pilgrim's Spontoon](/Pilgrim%27s+Spontoon "Dark Souls 2 Pilgrim%27s Spontoon"):** From the Upper Floor bonfire go to the circular room with the elevators.

Equip the [Hollow Skin](/Hollow+Skin "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Skin") before going down the stairs, since the Ashen Idol keeps this place cursed. Go down the stairs and 2 Ashen Warriors will emerge in the circular structure in the middle, and a Possessed Armor will attack you as soon as you are in range. You can't kill the Armor because of the Idol in the bottom, it will keep bringing it back to life. The best to do is to run to the bottom and destroy the idol so you can kill the enemies there.
