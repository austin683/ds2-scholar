### How to get Black Knight Greatsword

  * Located behind [illusory wall](/illusory+walls "Dark Souls 2 illusory walls") after [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol").
  * Rare drop from [Kobold](/Kobold "Dark Souls 2 Kobold") enemies at the entrance of [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep").

### Black Knight Greatsword Hints and Tips

  * Despite the clear reference to the Black Knight sword of the first Dark Souls, this weapon bears little resemblance to that weapon.
  * When you reach the ledge at the end of [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") where you can drop back down to the [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") bonfire there is a hidden wall to the right. There are 2 chests in the room. The sword is in the left chest.
  * As of Patch 1.03 this weapon can be buffed with spells.
  * One handed moveset is similiar to [Claymore](/Claymore "Dark Souls 2 Claymore"), While two handed moveset is same as [Thorned Greatsword](/Thorned+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Thorned Greatsword")'s two handed light attack, swinging speed is varied by light or strong attack.
  * Cannot use resins to buff weapon, however it is buffable with magic.
  * Considering the length and damage of this greatsword it's a viable option for STR/DEX fire caster builds, however it uses a sizable chunk of stamina for strong attacks. It can also knock down enemies with lunge attacks.
  * Two-handing this weapon alters your stance, allowing the wielder to leverage the weight of their body while striking; however, this greatly reduces the range of this weapon, which may cause inexperienced users to miss swings they expect to hit and leave themselves open to retaliation.
  * At Fire +5 with 40 STR/DEX, and 30 INT/FTH the Black Knight Greatsword does 268 + 81 Physical and 115 + 93 Fire Damage (AR 557).
  * The stats requirements in Scholar of the First Sin are different; you need 28 STR, 20 DEX, 8 INT (12 INT pre-SOTFS) and 12 FTH.
  * Used by [Syan Soldiers](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier") wielding swords.
