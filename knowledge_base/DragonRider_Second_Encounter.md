**The Twin Dragonriders** are a [Boss](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. The Twin Dragonriders consist of two formidable foes. One of them, stationed on a platform, employs a Great Bow, while the other adopts the moveset akin to the [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider") from [Heide's Tower](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame"). These dragonriders coordinate their attacks, providing a challenging encounter. [Bosses](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses") are unique and challenging Enemies that drop [Boss Souls](/Boss+Souls "Dark Souls 2 Boss Souls") capable of being transformed into powerful [Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons"), [Spells](/Spells "Dark Souls 2 Spells"), and [Items](/Items "Dark Souls 2 Items") for the player.

## The Twin Dragonriders Overview in Dark Souls 2

As the name implies, there are two Dragonriders. One of the dragonriders uses a Great Bow from a platform; the other uses the same moveset as the [Dragonrider](/DragonRider "Dark Souls 2 DragonRider") from [Heide's Tower](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame"). They will attack you together. The archer can come down after a certain threshold of damage has been done or if the player ever locks on to them; when the archer drops, it will switch to using a halberd as well.

### **The Twin Dragonriders Hints in Dark Souls 2**

  * The archer can be lured down by taking a certain amount of damage, standing in its blind spot, fighting the second Dragonrider beneath its platform, or destroying the pillars supporting its platform.
  * It is also possible to make the Red Dragonrider attack and destroy the platform, causing the archer to fall down and thus useful in ranged strategies.
  * It is recommended to use dark mist as soon as you hit the fog gate, on the archer, then just avoid the melee one until the archer stops taking damage. This will get him about 3/4 the way dead.
  * The archer has less HP than the melee Dragonrider (around 1470 vs 3670).
  * Both Dragonriders can be poisoned; it takes about 4 - 5 hits from a [Poison Throwing Knife](/Poison+Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Poison Throwing Knife") or [Poison Arrow](/Poison+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Poison Arrow") for the poison to take effect, and you will need at least 10 [Poison Throwing Knives](/Poison+Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Poison Throwing Knife") to finish off each of them. The archer should die within one cycle of poisoning, and the melee Dragonrider within 2 cycles plus a few melee hits.
  * [Pilgrim Bellclaire](/Pilgrim+Bellclaire "Dark Souls 2 Pilgrim Bellclaire") can be summoned near the fog gate for this fight. (Sotfs only)
  * [Bashful Ray](/Bashful+Ray "Dark Souls 2 Bashful Ray") can be summoned and led to this fight from his summon sign in the room full of Golems, Stone Soldiers, and Ruin Sentinels.

### **Magic/Ranged**

When the fight begins, focus your attacks on the archer; for magic users, [Great Lightning Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear"), [Soul Spear](/Soul+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Soul Spear"), [Dark Fog](/Dark+Fog "Dark Souls 2 Dark Fog"), and [Chaos Storm](/Chaos+Storm "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Storm") are effective. After the archer is dead, the fight can be continued according to the same strategy as the lone [Dragonrider](/DragonRider "Dark Souls 2 DragonRider") in [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame").

Or use dark mist as soon as entering, as this will get the archer 3/4 the way dead, then just avoid punishment for killing his best friend.

### **Melee**

Focus your attacks on the ground level Dragonrider according to the same strategy as the lone [Dragonrider](/DragonRider "Dark Souls 2 DragonRider") in [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame") until the archer jumps down. After the archer jumps down, focus on that one, then return to the second one. Long, fast weapons are recommended, such as the Ultra Greatsword, the Black Knight Greatsword, or a buffed katana. Melee weapons infused with Fire or Lightning are also a good choice, as the Twin Dragonriders are weak to both those damage types.

### **Pyromancy**

Once again, lure the archer into jumping down, then hit them both with [Fire Whip](/Fire+Whip "Dark Souls 2 Fire Whip"). With some luck, this will stagger one or both of them, and you'll be able to pull of consecutive casts. When you run out of casts use one or two [Chaos Storm](/Chaos+Storm "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Storm") spells to finish them off. If you see them wind up to attack, try to dodge it and move behind their backs. It is recommeded to have Pyromancy Flame +9. No rings necessary, but equipping the [Northern Ritual Band](/Northern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Northern Ritual Band") and the [Clear Bluestone Ring](/Clear+Bluestone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Clear Bluestone Ring") might help.
