**Darkstorm** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> "An esoteric spell created by Navlaan, the infamous exiled sorcerer.  
> Creates a local vortex of dark flame.  
>   
> The heretic Navlaan was executed along with his entire village, and the mere utterance of his name became a crime. Some say it was because he sought to restore the banned art of resurrection.  
>   
> Catalyst: sacred chime"

### Acquired From

  * [Darkdiver Grandahl](/Darkdiver+Grandahl "Dark Souls 2 Darkdiver Grandahl") for 4700 souls.
  * [Magerold of Lanafir](/Magerold+of+Lanafir "Dark Souls 2 Magerold of Lanafir") for 4700 souls.

### Notes

  * A vortex of black flame with orbs of darkness (similar in appearance to the orbs of the [Affinity](/Affinity "Dark Souls 2 Affinity") spell) will begin to circle your character and spiral outwards, dealing damage to those it comes into contact with. Knocks down certain enemies.
  * Hex version of [Soul Vortex](/Soul+Vortex "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vortex"), although the orbs circle the caster around instead of having the vortex projected out.
