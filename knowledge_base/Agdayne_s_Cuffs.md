_"Robe/Cuffs/Kilt worn by Agdayne of the Undead Crypt._   
  
_Life itself is suffering; or karma, as some have called it._   
  
_The embrace of death awaits all things. But does death mean an end to suffering?"_   
  
  

###  Set Location

  * Receive from Agdayne after obtaining the King's Ring
  * Dropped from Agdayne if you decided to kill him, it's possible to get 2 duplicates if doing both.

  
  
  

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with Twinkling Titanite
  * Handcuff gives 1 extra point of faith
  * The armor resembles the Ancient Antiquity toga, tunic, and sandals from Ancient Rome and Greece.
