**Crest of Blood** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **Crest of Blood** , the ring of the Brotherhood of Blood Covenant. It's unremarkable, yet behind its simple design lies the potent commitment of those who take the oath. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> Ring of the Brotherhood of Blood Covenant. This is nothing special. Perhaps, in the end, an oath is but a window into the ambitions of the oath taker. If you have taken this oath, then you know what you want. To be soaked in the blood of your kind."

### DS2 Crest of Blood Tips and Notes

  * [Shadow Gauntlets](/Shadow+Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Gauntlets") provide the same effect as this ring, and the two effects stack together.
  * It has been confirmed that you DO NOT need to wear the crest ring to rank up and it serves NO PURPOSE within the Covenant. The ONLY purpose of wearing the ring is for its increase to Bleed effects.
