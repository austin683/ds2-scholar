### How to get Longsword in Dark Souls 2

  * A [Fire Longsword](/Fire+Longsword "Dark Souls 2 Fire Longsword") can be acquired from a cavern near the Cardinal Tower bonfire (The one with the [Flame Lizard](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") at the end, behind a broken grate), this variant is commonly used by beginners and seasoned players alike, as enemies in this area are susceptible to fire. Most enemies later on are not.
  * Sold by [Blacksmith Lenigrast](/Blacksmith+Lenigrast "Dark Souls 2 Blacksmith Lenigrast") for 1300 souls.
  * Drop from [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") in [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man's+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man's Wharf").
  * In Majula Mansion as limited edition reskinned weapon during the release of [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King") DLC, and with the 1.10 patch. See [Events](/Events "Dark Souls 2 Events") for seasonal details.

### DS2 Longsword Hints and Tips

  * The Longsword has slightly lower base damage than a [Broadsword](/Broadsword "Dark Souls 2 Broadsword"), but it has a powerful thrusting attack when 2-handing and exceptionally fast, which the broadsword lacks and is overall one of the most versatile weapons in the game.
  * Has a full suit of thrusting attacks except for the one handed strong attack which is a slashing attack.
  * The 2 handed thrust has a [Counter Modifier](/Counter+Damage "Dark Souls 2 Counter Damage") of 100 instead of 110. Therefore you can't inflict Counter damage with it unless you have the [Old Leo Ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring") equipped.
  * The one handed normal attack is incredibly fast and can easily catch opponents midroll if they try to roll through your attack.
  * Most heavily armored enemies, such as the large sentinels in Heide's Tower of Flame and many bosses, are resistant to straight sword slashing damage but weak to strike (blunt) damage. Upgrade weapons with different damage types or you will struggle with some enemies.
