### Throne of Want Walkthrough

### Back-to-Back-to-Back

In order to reach this place, travel to [Drangleic Castle's](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") "[King's Gate](/King's+Gate "Dark Souls 2 King's Gate")" bonfire. Leave the bonfire room and head left, equip the [King's Ring](/King%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Ring") and the door will open, and you'll find [Emerald Herald](/Emerald+Herald "Dark Souls 2 Emerald Herald"). She will explain her origins, and [Nashandra's](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") intentions to you, before sending you on your way. 

Follow the torch-lit stone path to the fog gate, where the summon signs for [Vengarl](/Head+of+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Head of Vengarl"), [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo") and [Bradley of the Old Guard](/Bradley+of+the+Old+Guard "Dark Souls 2 Bradley of the Old Guard") (who will only be available if [Aldia, scholar of the First Sin](/Aldia,+scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Aldia, scholar of the First Sin") is the final boss), are all available in close proximity. Proceed through the fog to start your final battles.

BOSS FIGHT: [Throne Watcher and Throne Defender](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher and Throne Defender")

If you have the [Giant's Kinship](/Giant%27s+Kinship "Dark Souls 2 Giant%27s Kinship"), the second fight begins as soon as the first finishes. If you haven't acquired it yet, you'll have to return once you do to fight [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") and proceed to the throne.

BOSS FIGHT: [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra")

However, if you have interacted with the [Scholar of the First Sin](/Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin") and defeated [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick"), he will appear right after defeating [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra"). Thus making the choice of leaving the throne possible.

BOSS FIGHT: [Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin](/Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin")

### Endings

See [Endings](/Endings "Dark Souls 2 Endings") page.

### Throne of Want Notes

  * If the player enters the Throne of Want before the [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord") is defeated only the Throne Watcher and Throne Defender boss is encountered here. This can be utilized to avoid back to back boss fights as the player is free to leave after.
  * Anyone summoned for the first fight will stay for the second if the player has the [Giant Lord Soul](/Giant+Lord+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord Soul") prior to entering the Throne of Want.
  * Despite the fact that the golems move to form a bridge towards the throne of want in the ending cutscene, the golems stay in the same position after the cutscene ends, this makes reaching the throne in-game impossible.
  * Even with the [Giant's Kinship](/Giant's+Kinship "Dark Souls 2 Giant's Kinship") already acquired, it is still possible to avoid back to back fights. To achieve this, use the [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") right after defeating the Throne Watcher/Defender Boss.
