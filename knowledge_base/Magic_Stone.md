**Magic Stone** is a type of [Upgrade Material](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Magic Stone** , a modified form of titanite. Apply it to a weapon to translate the wielder's intelligence into an offensive attribute. Inapplicable to shields. Exclusive usage at Blacksmith [Steady Hand McDuff's](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff") forge. [Upgrade Materials](/Upgrades "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades") are items that are used to strengthen the statistical value and to increase the effect of a certain piece of equipment.

> An altered state of titanite. Use on weapon to convert wielder's intelligence into attack. Cannot be used on shields.  
> Sorcerers at the Melfian Magic Academy once attempted to imbue titanite with carious elements, but are said to have failed. Someone must have succeeded, though; what else would explain this stone?

### Dark Souls 2 Magic Stone Usage

  * Can only be used at Blacksmith [Steady Hand Mc Duff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff")
  * Used to imbue weapons with an Intelligence-based magic bonus. This removes all the other scaling a weapon has. (Different weapons add different tiers of scaling). Can not be used on shields. Comparable to Dark Souls 1's Enchanted upgrade.
  * At 50 Int, the Enchanted path will outscale the Raw path if the weapon has no scaling by default.
  * Even at maximum INT, and base stats to wield a weapon, many +10 weapons will see a damage reduction from infusing with this stone. This is due to the Enchanted path having extremely poor scaling.
