**Simpleton's Spice** is a type of [Consumable](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Simpleton's Spice** , an aromatic spice, makes a chosen spell attainable with 1 less intelligence, offering a shortcut for the devoted. It requires assistance from a specific individual and doesn't increase intelligence but only obfuscates the requirement. [Consumable Items](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") grant various effects such as restorative properties for recovering HP, removing certain negative status effects, applying temporary buffs and debuffs, as well as activating various actions and effects.

### Dark Souls 2 Simpleton's Spice Usage

  * Lowers INT requirement of a spell by 1, to a minimum of 10. (Similar to [Skeptic's Spice](/Skeptic%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic%27s Spice") for miracles)
  * You can use Spice multiple times on the same spell.
  * Can be used to lower the INT requirement for hexes.
  * Affects all copies of the spell, not just the single scroll chosen.
  * Take to [Magerold of Lanafir](/Magerold+of+Lanafir "Dark Souls 2 Magerold of Lanafir") in the Iron Keep to use.

### Simpleton's Spice Notes and Tips in DKS2

  * You can use as many spices as you want on one spell until the spell only requires 10 int and/or faith.
  * Spell duration stacks with intelligence, not catalyst power.
  * Spell strength stacks with catalyst power, not intelligence.
  * Using a Simpleton's Spice in itself will NOT reduce the efficacy of a spell, only the lower INT the player has will affect the spell's damage/duration. Example: You have a spell that needs 40 INT and use 10 spices to lower the requirement to 30. While you have 30-39 INT the spell will be less efficient, not because of the spice, but because you have less INT than initially needed. Once you have 40 INT, the spell will behave the same as before the use of the spice.

### Dark Souls 2 Simpleton's Spice Locations

  * 2 in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley") after the "The Mines" bonfire. down the center hole into the cave filled with poison gas and another in one of the tunnels in the area with the sickle-wielding undead.
  * 1 in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") at the opposite end of the outside ledge, where [Gilligan](/Laddersmith+Gilligan "Dark Souls 2 Laddersmith Gilligan") is standing.
  * 1 in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") under the webs just before [The Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja").
  * 1 in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"). Go up the ladder past the Mimic Chest and drop to the ledges below.
  * (Actually Simpletons's spices) 3 in [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"). First on a body between the tower with the stairs to the roof and the outer fence, second near the fence on the roof with the dual Avelyn NPC, and the final one near the fence close to the bottom of the ladder beside the exit fog gate. This is the easiest area to farm for this item with bonfire ascetics, as there are three locations very close to one another.
  * 2 in [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") on the hidden ledge under the stairs with the two knights just past [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne")'s room. Fall next to the ladder in the corner. The second is just outside the second bonfire.
  * 1 in[ Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep"), just before the second [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") breaks the wall.
  * 1 in [Iron Passage](/Iron+passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron passage") in one of the cells holding an [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") after the second lever.
  * 1 bought from Sorcerer [Carhillion of the Fold](/Carhillion+of+the+Fold "Dark Souls 2 Carhillion of the Fold") for 13,000 souls.
  * 1 is rewarded by [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan") for killing Cale.
  * Dropped by the hollows near the Harval's Resting Place bonfire in [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints").
  * Dropped by white undead mages in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") (very uncommon).
  * Dropped by [Leydia Witches](/Leydia+Witch "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Witch") in [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") (very uncommon).
  * (SotFS confirmed) Dropped by [Insolent Spirits](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits") in [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") after lighting the sconces on the bridge and below the shortcut area. It's advised that you first beat the boss and light all bonfires and only attempt to kill the spirits after. Do not light the sconces if you don't wish to kill them yet. (fairly common drop)

#### Spice Farming with Bonfire Ascetic in Dark Souls 2

  * 3 can be farmed in [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") and only requires you to defeat The Old Iron King for the first time making this by far the most efficient method as the 2 enemies that can drop it do so extremely rarely
  * 2 can be farmed in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley") via "The Mines" bonfire but you will have to defeat the [Covetous Demon](/Covetous+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Demon") each time. You will also net 2 Skeptic's spice.
