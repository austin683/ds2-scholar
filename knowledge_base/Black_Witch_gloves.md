### Black Witch Gloves Description

_"Robe worn by Zullie the witch,seducer of Alva of Wayfarer. Boasts excellent magic defense._  
_When Zullie the witch learned of Alva's dedication to Saint Serrate she used all manner of tricks and deceit to ruin him, but in the end she would spend her life with him, supporting his endeavors."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Buy from [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan) (Speak to him while Hollow after completing his quest line)
  * Black Witch Domino Mask is a droppable item from the dual-Avelyn wielding phantoms in Belfry Sol, who will only spawn once per ascetic/playthrough(very rare drop)
  * Black Witch Veil is a droppable item from Zullie the witch at the very beginning of Belfry Sol, who will only spawn once per ascetic/playthrough(very rare drop) [Needs confirmation: The drop is certain, but the Grey Phantom might not be the real Zullie the Witch, due to the fact of being actually male.] [It is not Zullie the Witch because the first Grey Phantom in Belfry Sol is male and he's wearing the Astrologist set.]
  * DropGutter Denizen - after all the sconces in The Gutter are lit

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with: [Twinkling Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore)
  * Very good magic protection if complete set
  * Gloves change your nails appearance (Tested on female character - PC)
