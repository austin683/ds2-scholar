**Black Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Black Hood/Robe/Gloves/Boots Belonged to Straid of Olaphis.  
>    
>  Straid was invited to the old kingdom of Olaphis for his wisdom, but its depth was such that people soon feared him, and in the end Straid was led into a dreadful trap.  
>    
>  Straid spent several lifetimes as stone. During this hiatus, kingdoms rose and fell, until the land called Drangleic came to be.

###  Set Location

  * Obtained from [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis") by trading him 4 boss souls and speaking to him.
  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") (15k, minus hood) if Straid is killed.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Hood grants +2 to INT and FTH and improves casting speed (edit: more than Chaos Hood).
  * Robe offers second highest magic defense.
  * Boots offer the highest magic defense, as well as second highest fire defense (equal to that of [Black Dragon](/Black+Dragon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Set") leggings, [Bone King](/Bone+King+Set "Dark Souls 2 Bone King Set") and [Saint's](/Saint's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Saint's Set") boots and almost equal to that of [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Set") and [Syan's](/Syan's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Syan's Set") leggings).
  * The set requires 16 INT.
