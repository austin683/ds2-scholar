### Drangleic Castle Walkthrough

### Access

The Castle is reached after defeating and acquiring the souls the four [Bosses](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses"): The [Old Iron King](/Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Old Iron King") in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"), [The Rotten](/The+Rotten "Dark Souls 2 The Rotten") in [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch"), [The Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner") in [Sinners' Rise](/Sinner%27s+Rise "Dark Souls 2 Sinner%27s Rise"), and [Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja") in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). Alternatively, the door can be opened by acquiring sufficient [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory"), that vary according to your NG status - click [here](/Shrine+of+Winter "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Winter") for more details. 

From the **Ruined Fork Road Bonfire** in the [Shaded Woods,](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") head up the stairs to find three doorways. Out the left doorway, you'll find a path riddled with [Falconers](/Falconer "Dark Souls 2 Falconer") that lead down a slope until you reach a [Forest Grotesque](/Forest+Grotesque "Dark Souls 2 Forest Grotesque"), a [Ghost](/Roaming+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Roaming Soul"), a door arch blocked by rubble. Look left for a stone path, and you will enter the [Shrine of Winter](/Shrine+of+Winter "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Winter"). If you have all four souls or sufficient [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory"), the **Black Gate** will open you can proceed through the other doorway, and down the path to take you to the Castle.

On your way, when you come down the zigzag slope, head right to pick up a [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero"), then continue left. You will shortly come across a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing"), and a couple of [Ghosts](/Roaming+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Roaming Soul"). Continue down the path to find a corpse on a small wall on the right, containing a [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier"), and a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Shortly after, you'll find the entrance to a tunnel that leads a set of stairs. Eventually, you'll reach the outdoors. Proceed forward and you will reach a long spiral staircase, atop of which you will find three [Royal Swordsmen](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman") on your left. Proceed up the next set of stairs, making sure to check a boulder on the right for 2x [Holy Water Urn](/Holy+Water+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Holy Water Urn"). Walk a little further to be prompted with the title, signifying your entry to the Castle.

### Exterior Staircase

Note: While you are in the outside area of the Castle, the rain will drench you and any enemy in water, reducing everyone's lightning resistance and increases everyone's fire resistance.

Immediately after seeing the 'Drangleic Castle' title prompt, you'll find a [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard") on the stairs. At the first archway, the [Emerald Herald](/Emerald+Herald "Dark Souls 2 Emerald Herald") from [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") will be there to allow you to exhaust her limited dialogue. If you continue up the stairs, you'll come across two [Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight") statues; they will attack when you get too close, so get the jump on them, before they do on you.

Once you make it to the castle doors, you will be attacked by a total of five [Royal Swordsmen](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman"). If you stray to the right, one of the [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier") statues will come to life and join in the attack; if you stray to the left, two of the three here will also reanimate. This can get tricky to deal with since you also have to feed a soul to each of the Golems by the doors to actually open them (defeat an enemy near each of the Golems, you will not receive souls from enemies killed but can see them fly to activate the golems), however the big open space can play well into your hands. Once they've been dealt with, search the right side of the building to find a chest containing a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed") and [Great Combustion](/Great+Combustion "Dark Souls 2 Great Combustion"), then into the doors to enter the castle.

### Interior Castle

Once inside talk to the invisible NPC, [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager"), on the staircase. After exhausting his dialogue options and learning about the King and Queen, he will become a merchant.

After speaking with him, head down the left stairwell (facing the entrance). Once you enter the hallway on your left, a [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier") guarding a door, containing a chest with a [Sublime Bone Dust](/Sublime+Bone+Dust "Dark Souls 2 Sublime Bone Dust"). Continue down the hallway, baiting the [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier") statues to come alive, and killing any that do; including the one you killed first, there should be four statues that come to life in this particular hallway. Open the door at the end, and before you head down the ladder, one of the two "statues" is actually a [Royal Swordsman](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman"). Down the ladder will be two sets of pale blue doors. Open both to find the **[King's Gate bonfire](/King%27s+Gate "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Gate")**.

### Golem Door Hall

From the bonfire there will be two paths, left and right. Since you need a Key item to go left, you should go right instead. You will enter a room with several [Stone Soldiers](/Stone+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Stone Soldier"). Some in pairs in front of Golem doors that you have to feed a soul to in order to open, just like how you entered the castle. All the Golem doors in this room house a [Ruin Sentinel](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel"). At the back of the room are two Golems that will light torches if you feed them a soul. Once the Golems are fed souls, they need not be fed again.  
  
Once you kill a foe near one of the Golem doors it will open, but don't get excited. Behind each door except the first one on the right as you enter, a [Ruin Sentinel](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") guards an item or chest:

  * **Left side** : 
    1. Nothing to collect from the first room.
    2. 1x [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros Lockstone") in the middle room.
    3. The last room on this side hides a hole leading to a [darkdweller](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") guarding the [Faraam Set](/Faraam+Set "Dark Souls 2 Faraam Set"). If you take the tunnel on the left from down here, you may find [Darkdiver Grandahl](/Darkdiver+Grandahl "Dark Souls 2 Darkdiver Grandahl"). If this is the third time see him, you will be able to enter his Covenant '[the Pilgrims of the Dark](/Pilgrims+of+Dark "Dark Souls 2 Pilgrims of Dark")'. Make your way to the other tunnel to the [Under Castle Drangleic bonfire](/Under+Castle+Drangleic "Dark Souls 2 Under Castle Drangleic"). 
  * **Right side** : 
    1. For progress, enter the first room.
    2. Claim a [Mastodon Greatsword](/Mastodon+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Mastodon Greatsword") from the middle room.
    3. The [Royal Soldier's Ring +1](/Royal+Soldier%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier%27s Ring") can be obtained from the last room on this side.

### 

### The First Door on the Right

Once you pass through the Golem door, head to the chest with 15x [Dark Arrows](/Dark+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Dark Arrow") in front of you. Turning right and going up the stairs, you will find a corpse with the [Frozen Flower](/Frozen+Flower "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Flower"). Of the 3 statues in front of you, the right one will come alive as an [Royal Swordsman](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman"). Turn left and grab the 3x [Old Radiant Lifegem](/Old+Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Old Radiant Lifegem"), a [Monastery Charm](/Monastery+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Charm"), and a [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero") from the skeleton beneath the stairwell. Going up the stairs (don't mind the intimidating statues, none of them will come alive), you will eventually come to an outside area (indicated by the returning raining) with corrosive acid covering the floors and contraptions shaped like dragons (which get activated when they are hit by anything) spitting even more acid at you. As you enter the area, you will hear statues coming to life. Carefully looking up on the right, you will see the now alive [Royal Swordsman](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman"), ready to shoot lightning infused bolts at intruders.   
The acid pools will not deal any damage to you, but will greatly damage all of your equipment, so, after having taken care of the Swordsman, follow proper bathing etiquette and remove your equipped items. While taking a nice relaxing acid bath, gather the [Elizabeth Mushroom](/Elizabeth+Mushroom "Dark Souls 2 Elizabeth Mushroom") near the stairs, and the 3x [Corrosive Urn](/Corrosive+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Corrosive Urn") from a chest at the far end. After your bath, remember to reequip your items, then move upstairs. The second-from-right [Royal Swordsman](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman") will come alive to chase you, if you want to fight a bit more, you can also attack the one on the far right right and the one on the second-from-left to force them to come alive.

After taking care of everything in here, go to the right to a small outside passage. Ascend the stairs to come across a door to a room filled with masks. A chest in this room holds a [Large Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Large+Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Brave Warrior") and a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). After opening the chest, the masks all shoot arrows at you from all directions, so stand still and let the first shot shoot, then dash for the door. The arrows will buildup poison quickly, so be sure to have something to cure it in case you get hit too many times. Exiting the room will bring you to a small staircase above the acid pool. Ascend the stairs into the next room, which has three [Syan Soldiers](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier") statues that all come to life if you get too close to them. There is also a big painting of [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") in this room, be careful to not go too close to it, as it will quickly build up curse After dealing with the [Syan Soldiers](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier") pick up the loot that they were guarding which is in total, 10x [Fire Greatarrow](/Fire+Greatarrow "Dark Souls 2 Fire Greatarrow") and 10x [Destructive Greatarrow](/Destructive+Greatarrow "Dark Souls 2 Destructive Greatarrow"), 3x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"), and a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). 

### Dragonriding Duo Duel

Exiting this area via the door, you will get invaded by [Nameless Usurper](/Nameless+Usurper "Dark Souls 2 Nameless Usurper"). After dealing with her, going up some stairs will lead you outside (back into the rain) to some more stairs. You'll encounter two [Royal Swordsmen](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman") in the right, upper area, shooting lightning-infused bolts at you. When you enter the are the Swordsmen were, the [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier") behind you will come to live. After dealing with them, look for a ladder here and climb it down. There will be another [Royal Swordsmen](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman") coming to live her, guarding a corpse with a [Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Brave Warrior"). Examine the middle wall here; press the "use" button on your controller to reveal an illusory wall that opens to the [Forgotten Chamber bonfire](/Forgotten+Chamber "Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Chamber"). This is a good time to rest because of the upcoming boss fight. Another ladder directly in front of the bonfire wall take you down to a chest containing [Hunter's Blackbow](/Hunter's+Blackbow "Dark Souls 2 Hunter's Blackbow") and 20x [Iron Arrows](/Iron+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Iron Arrow"), and another [Royal Soldier](/Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier"). After opening the chest, climb back up the ladder and continue along the path you enter a room with the Queen seated at the far end. Talk to her, exit through the side, and get ready for a boss battle. If you need help for the Boss, a summon sign for [Pilgrim Bellclaire](/Pilgrim+Bellclaire "Dark Souls 2 Pilgrim Bellclaire") can be found on the right of the fog gate.

BOSS FIGHT: [Twin Dragonriders](/DragonRider\(Second+Encounter\) "Dark Souls 2 DragonRider\(Second Encounter\)")

### Elevator Mechanic

After this fight, move right to the next area, where we meet our friend [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo") again, siting near the **[Central Drangleic Castle bonfire](/Central+Drangleic+Castle+bonfire "Dark Souls 2 Central Drangleic Castle bonfire")**. The stairs up to the right only lead to a dead end (for now) as well as an [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"), shooting Great arrows from above, so head down the stairs on the left instead. After a short walk, you come into a room small room, with an elevator, which is currently unavailable to use. The door in front of you is locked as well, so head up the ladder on the right instead. Up the ladder and through a door we drop down into another room with a Golem, that needs to be activated with souls. Continue to the Golem Door Hall, none of these statues will come alive, instead, we have to get to the next room to find a worthy sacrifice. Before we enter the next room though, trigger the [Wall Spectre](/Wall+Spectre "Dark Souls 2 Wall Spectre") on the right of the door and take care of him before he gets a problem, then enter the next room. Carefully proceed further into the room, to trigger two old "friends" to appear, the [Masked Manikin](/Masked+Manikin "Dark Souls 2 Masked Manikin"). Lure at least one of them back to the Golem, to make their souls activate him, who in turn activates the elevator from earlier. After taking care of that, head back into the room, where you can loot the two iron chests: one contains the [Old Knight Hammer](/Old+Knight+Hammer "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight Hammer"), and the other one [Caitha's Chime](/Caitha%27s+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Caitha%27s Chime") and the [Soul Greatsword](/Soul+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Soul Greatsword"). This room also has a summon sign for [Sellsword Luet](/Sellsword+Luet "Dark Souls 2 Sellsword Luet"). The next room has is a big staircase, and an [Executioner's Chariot](/Executioners+Chariot "Dark Souls 2 Executioners Chariot") that drops [Gower's Ring of Protection](/Gower%27s+Ring+of+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Gower%27s Ring of Protection").

At the top of the staircase, an [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") with a hammer will attack you. There's an [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") guarding a chest on each side at the top as well. The chest on the right contains the Pyromancy spell, [Fire Storm](/Fire+Storm "Dark Souls 2 Fire Storm"). While the chest on the left isn't actually a chest, it's a mimic chest containing a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") and a [Washing Pole](/Washing+Pole "Dark Souls 2 Washing Pole"). Head back down the stairs and out the doors to find yourself back outside. On the right, you will see a blue door, and right next to it, a path going down. The door doesn't open, but there is a ladder next to it which you can use to climb, and kill the [Gargoyle](/Gargoyle "Dark Souls 2 Gargoyle") and [Alonne Archer](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain").

Head back down the ladder and go through the small brown door at the bottom of the stair, to two [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress "Dark Souls 2 Desert Sorceress"), another [Wall Spectre](/Wall+Spectre "Dark Souls 2 Wall Spectre") and a corpse with 5x [Repair Power](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder"), and 10x [Flame Butterfly](/Flame+Butterfly "Dark Souls 2 Flame Butterfly"). The chest near the ballista also holds an [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard"). Now pull the lever near the gate and it will open. Open the door and make your way down the stairs to the previous **Central Drangleic Castle bonfire**.

### Passage to the King's Passage

From here head to the elevator and take it upwards, and through the door, entering a room with a caged cell containing an unlucky woman in it and an even more unlucky hollow, chained and bound to it upside down. His side-story can be found here: [The Embedded](/Key+to+the+Embedded "Dark Souls 2 Key to the Embedded").

There are three chests in here - one has the [Key to King's Passage](/Key+to+King%27s+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Key to King%27s Passage"), another contains a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed") and [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel"), and the last one holds the [Strong Magic Shield](/Strong+Magic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Strong Magic Shield"). Last but not least there's a hidden **Hollow** on the bars opposite of The Embedded. Just attack the bars and he'll drop a [Small Smooth & Silky Stone](/Small+Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth & Silky Stone").

Take the elevator back down and use the [Key to King's Passage](/Key+to+King%27s+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Key to King%27s Passage") to open the previously looked big doors to [King's Passage](/King's+Passage "Dark Souls 2 King's Passage").  
  

### Farming (Souls & Titanite)

The [Ruin Sentinels](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") and the [Stone Soldiers](/Stone+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Stone Soldier") respawn, making the Golem Door Hall a constant danger, if you open all of the Golem doors to get the items. While a danger, this also presents an opportunity to farm since the Stone Soldiers spawn infinitely and [Stone Soldiers](/Stone+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Stone Soldier") have a rare chance of dropping [Titanite Slabs](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab"),.

A good way of dealing with the [Ruin Sentinels](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") is to take them back to where the bonfire is, and keep them in that corridor. They won't attack you, but they will keep their shield up. It's slow to kill them, but it's much safer. You just have to stand in front of them while they try to walk back to the big open area. You can pull them towards that corridor so they start walking back, then moving towards them to make them attack. All of these attacks are guardable with a 100% physical resistance shield, and easily evaded by rolling. After they've attacked, you've got time to get one or two attacks or spells in while they don't have their shields up. As soon as their attack animation is complete, they'll raise their shield and ease out of the corridor, allowing you to rinse and repeat until they're finished. Try using poison arrows, 5-6 hits on a [Sentinel](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") are required to trigger the poison effect. You can also use Poison Mist and Toxic Mist through walls to poison them. They give some decent souls and can also drop their armor, so this area is pretty much ideal for farming, but only in NG, as they don't respawn in more advanced playthroughs. [On my third playthrough I found that they respawn just as before, please confirm/edit]

  * [Crystal Lizard](/crystal+lizard "Dark Souls 2 crystal lizard")
  * [Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight")

### Notes

  * The skeleton beneath the stairwell right after you proceed through the progress golem door has [Great Magic Barrier](/Great+Magic+Barrier "Dark Souls 2 Great Magic Barrier") in NG+ instead of 3x [Old Radiant Lifegem](/Old+Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Old Radiant Lifegem"), 1x [Monastery Charm](/Monastery+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Charm"), and 1x [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero").

### Drangleic Castle Walkthrough

### Access

The Castle is reached after defeating and acquiring the souls the four [Bosses](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses"): The [Old Iron King](/Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Old Iron King") in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"), [The Rotten](/The+Rotten "Dark Souls 2 The Rotten") in [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch"), [The Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner") in [Sinners' Rise](/Sinners'+Rise "Dark Souls 2 Sinners' Rise"), and [Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja") in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). Alternatively, the door can be opened by acquiring sufficient [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory"), that vary according to your NG status - click [here](/Shrine+of+Winter "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Winter") for more details. 

From the **Ruined Fork Road Bonfire** in the [Shaded Woods,](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") head up the stairs to find three doorways. Out the left doorway, you'll find a path riddled with [Forest Grotesques](/Forest+Grotesque "Dark Souls 2 Forest Grotesque") that lead down a slope until you reach a door arch blocked by rubble. Look left for a stone path, and you will enter the [Shrine of Winter](/Shrine+of+Winter "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Winter"). If you have all four souls or sufficient [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory"), the **Black Gate** will open and you can proceed through the other doorway, and down the path to take you to the Castle. On your way, when you come down the zig-zag slope, head right to pick up a [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero"), then continue left. You will shortly come across a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing"), and a [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") resting ahead.

Continue down the path to find a corpse on a small wall on the right, containing a [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier"), and a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Shortly after, you'll arrive at a large set of stairs, which eventually leads to a long spiral staircase. Atop of which, you will find three [Royal Swordsmen](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman") on your left. Proceed up the next set of stairs, making sure to check a boulder on the right for 2x [Holy Water Urn](/Holy+Water+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Holy Water Urn"). Walk a little further to be prompted with the title, signifying your entry to the Castle.

### Exterior Staircase

Immediately after seeing the 'Drangleic Castle' title prompt, you'll find a [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard") on the stairs. At the first archway, the [Emerald Herald](/Emerald+Herald "Dark Souls 2 Emerald Herald") from [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") will be there to allow you to exhaust her limited dialogue. If you continue up the stairs, you'll come across two [Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight") statues; they will attack when you get too close, so get the jump on them before they do on you.

Once you make it to the castle doors, you will be attacked by several [Royal Swordsmen](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman"). This can get tricky to deal with since you also have to feed a soul to each of the Golems by the doors to actually open them, however the big open space can play well into your hands. Once they've been dealt with, search the right side of the building to find a chest containing a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed") and [Great Combustion](/Great+Combustion "Dark Souls 2 Great Combustion"), then into the doors to enter the castle.

### Interior Castle

Once inside talk to the invisible [NPC, Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager"), on the staircase. After exhausting his dialogue, learn the "This one's me" Gesture, and learning about the King and Queen, he will become a merchant.

After speaking with him, head down the left stairwell (facing the entrance). Once you enter the hallway on your left, there should be a total of two [Royal Swordsmen](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman") and a [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier") in this particular hallway. Open the door at the end, and take care of the [Royal Swordsman](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman") then head down the ladder to find two sets of pale blue doors. Open both to find the **[King's Gate bonfire](/King%27s+Gate "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Gate")**.

### Golem Door Hall

From the bonfire there will be two paths, left and right. Since you need a Key item to go left, you should go right instead. You will enter a room with several [Stone Soldiers](/Stone+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Stone Soldier"). Some in pairs in front of Golem doors that you have to feed a soul in order to open, just like how you entered the castle. All the Golem doors in this room house a [Ruin Sentinel](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel"), except for the first door on the right. At the back of the room are two Golems that will light torches if you feed them a soul. Once the golems/golem doors are fed, they need not be again.

Once you kill a foe near one of the Golem doors it will open, but don't get too carried away yet. Behind each door except the first one on the right as you enter, a [Ruin Sentinel](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") guards an item or chest:

  * **Left side** : 
    1. Nothing to collect from the first room.
    2. 1x [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros Lockstone") in the middle room.
    3. The last room on this side hides a hole leading to a darkdweller guarding the [Faraam Set](/Faraam+Set "Dark Souls 2 Faraam Set"). If you take the tunnel on the left from down here, you may find [Darkdiver Grandahl](/Darkdiver+Grandahl "Dark Souls 2 Darkdiver Grandahl"). If this is the third time see him, you will be able to enter his Covenant 'the Pilgrims of the Dark'. Make your way to the other tunnel to the [Under Castle Drangleic bonfire](/Under+Castle+Drangleic "Dark Souls 2 Under Castle Drangleic"). 
  * **Right side** : 
    1. For progress, enter the first room.
    2. Claim a [Mastodon Greatsword](/Mastodon+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Mastodon Greatsword") from the middle room.
    3. The [Royal Soldier's Ring +1](/Royal+Soldier%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier%27s Ring") can be obtained from the last room on this side.

### Farming (Souls & Titanite)

These [Ruin Sentinels](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") and the [Stone Soldiers](/Stone+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Stone Soldier") respawn, making this room a constant danger, if you open all of the Golem doors to get the items. While a danger, this also presents an opportunity to farm since they spawn infinitely and [Stone Soldiers](/Stone+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Stone Soldier") have a rare chance of dropping [Titanite Slabs](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab").

A good way of dealing with the [Ruin Sentinels](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") is to take them back to where the bonfire is, and keep them in that corridor. They won't attack you, but they will keep their shield up. It's slow to kill them, but it's much safer. You just have to stand in front of them while they try to walk back to the big open area. You can pull them towards that corridor so they start walking back, then moving towards them to make them attack. All of these attacks are guardable with a 100% physical resistance shield, and easily evaded by rolling. After they've attacked, you've got time to get one or two attacks or spells in while they don't have their shields up. As soon as their attack animation is complete, they'll raise their shield and ease out of the corridor, allowing you to rinse and repeat until they're finished. Try using poison arrows. 5-6 hits on a [Sentinel](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") are required to trigger the poison effect. You can also use Poison Mist and Toxic Mist through walls to poison them. They give some decent souls and can also drop their armor, so this area is pretty much ideal for farming, but only in NG, as they don't respawn in more advanced playthroughs.

### The First Door on the Right

Once you pass through the Golem door, head up the stairs. On the left is a chest with 15x [Dark Arrows](/Dark+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Dark Arrow"), and after going up the stairs you can grab the 3x [Old Radiant Lifegem](/Old+Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Old Radiant Lifegem"), a [Monastery Charm](/Monastery+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Charm"), and a [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero") from the skeleton beneath the stairwell. You eventually come to a room with corrosive acid covering the floors and contraptions shaped like dragons spitting even more acid at you. It does not affect HP but will BREAK your armor quite quickly. Be sure to remove all your gear if you want to play around in the acid. In here you will find a chest if you continue to the left, containing 3x [Corrosive Urn](/Corrosive+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Corrosive Urn"), and a dead body just next to the stairs you will be ascending, holding an [Elizabeth Mushroom](/Elizabeth+Mushroom "Dark Souls 2 Elizabeth Mushroom"). Move up to the platform with the statues, then proceed to the stairs.

Ascend to the next area and you will come across a door to a room filled with masks that will shoot poison arrows as soon as you enter. There is also a drop of a [Large Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Large+Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Brave Warrior") and a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). The best way to go about this is to rush to open the door, then pick up the items. The next room has three [Syan Soldiers](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier"), and a large painting that builds up your 'cursed' state extremely quickly-so easy to avoid, just don't walk in front of it. 

### Dragonriding Duo Duel

Exiting this area via the door will trigger the invasion of the [Nameless Usurper](/Nameless+Usurper "Dark Souls 2 Nameless Usurper") that will spawn to the left of the door. Once that's dealt with, head continue up the stairs until you encounter two [Royal Swordsmen](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman"). Look for a ladder here and take it down, and if you didn't kill them already, there will be another [Royal Soldier](/Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier") waiting for you here guarding a corpse with a [Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Brave Warrior"). Examine the middle wall here; press the "use" button on your controller to reveal an illusory wall that opens to the [Forgotten Chamber bonfire](/Forgotten+Chamber "Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Chamber").

This is a good time to rest because of the upcoming boss fight. Another ladder directly in front of the bonfire wall take you down to a chest containing [Hunter's Blackbow](/Hunter's+Blackbow "Dark Souls 2 Hunter's Blackbow") and 20x [Iron Arrows](/Iron+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Iron Arrow"), and another [Royal Soldier](/Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier"). After opening the chest, climb back up the ladders and continue along the stairy path you enter a room with the Queen seated at the far end, that you can talk to.

Exit through the right side to find the boss fog.

BOSS FIGHT: [Twin Dragonriders](/DragonRider%28Second+Encounter%29 "Dark Souls 2 DragonRider%28Second Encounter%29")

### Elevator Mechanic

After this fight, move right to the next area you will arrive at the **[Central Drangleic Castle bonfire](/Central+Drangleic+Castle+bonfire "Dark Souls 2 Central Drangleic Castle bonfire")** , and find [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo") nearby. From here, head down the stairs. There are three paths to take, two of which are unavailable. One is the iron door "[King's Passage](/King%27s+Passage#King's+Passage-Walkthrough "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Passage#King's Passage-Walkthrough")" and the second is an elevator that has yet to drop down that will cover the big hole in the floor. So take the only route you can, the lengthy ladder to a room with another Golem that needs to be activated by souls again.

As soon as you get to the top, hug the right wall. This will prevent all of the [Stone Soldiers](/Stone+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Stone Soldier") from reanimating at the same time and will let you deal with less. There are a total of six [Stone Soldiers](/Stone+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Stone Soldier") in this room, but using this technique will only force you to deal with three, leaving the fate of the other three in your hands. Hug the wall, taking them out as you go, and ensuring you kill one close enough to the Golem so he may claim its soul and activate the elevator from earlier. There's also a door on the same side of the room that within, contain two iron chests: one contains the [Old Knight Hammer](/Old+Knight+Hammer "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight Hammer"), and the other one [Caitha's Chime](/Caitha%27s+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Caitha%27s Chime") and the [Soul Greatsword](/Soul+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Soul Greatsword"). The next room has a doorway and a big staircase.

At the top of the staircase, it splits to two more stairs, and on each side holds a chest, guarded by two [Alonne Knight Captains](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain"). On the right, the chest that contains the Pyromancy spell, [Fire Storm](/Fire+Storm "Dark Souls 2 Fire Storm"). While the chest on the left is poison-trapped, and contains 10x [Fire Greatarrow](/Fire+Greatarrow "Dark Souls 2 Fire Greatarrow"). Head back down the stairs and proceed to the door to find a [Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight") and two [Syan Soldiers](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier") to deal with before you can find yourself back outside. 

Before you can even take a second to breathe, you have another [Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight") to fight. After you do, on the right you will see a blue door, and right next to it, a path going down. The door doesn't open, but there is a ladder next to it which you can use to climb, and kill the three [Alonne Knight Captains](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") up here. Head back down the ladder and go through the small brown door at the bottom of the stairs, to two [Desert Sorceresses](/Desert+Sorceress "Dark Souls 2 Desert Sorceress"), 5x [Repair Power](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder"), and 10x [Flame Butterfly](/Flame+Butterfly "Dark Souls 2 Flame Butterfly"). The chest near the ballista also holds a [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard"). Now pull the lever near the gate and it will open. Open the door and make your way down the stairs to the previous **Central Drangleic Castle bonfire**.

### Passage to the King's Passage

From here head to the room that had the locked door and giant hole in the floor. It will now have an elevator, the Golem you fed earlier did that for you. You can now take it up by activating the pressure switch in the middle of it. You can also now call it down by pulling the lever right next to it. Once at the top there will be a caged cell with an unlucky woman in it and an even more unlucky hollow, chained and bound to it upside down. His side-story can be found here: [The Embedded](/Key+to+the+Embedded "Dark Souls 2 Key to the Embedded").

There are three chests in here - one has the [Key to King's Passage](/Key+to+King%27s+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Key to King%27s Passage"), another contains a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed") and [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel"), and the last one holds the [Strong Magic Shield](/Strong+Magic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Strong Magic Shield"). Last but not least there's a hidden **Hollow** on the bars opposite of The Embedded. Just attack the bars and he'll drop a [Small Smooth & Silky Stone](/Small+Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth & Silky Stone").

Take the elevator back down and use the [Key to King's Passage](/Key+to+King%27s+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Key to King%27s Passage") to open the previously seen big doors.
