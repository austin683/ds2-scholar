**Buckler** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing. 

     _"A traditional small metal shield._

     _Small shields are very light and easy to use, but have low stability when attacked._

     _The center of a buckler is convex, designed to brush attacks aside, making parrying easier."_

### Acquired From:

  * [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") before the ladder to Cardinal Tower Bonfire.

### Buckler Hints and Tips

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * This shield along with the [Target Shield](/Target+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Target Shield") has the best parry frame of any shield in the game.
  * Strong early game for parrying, but fairly weak for blocking high damage attacks.
  * Parrying barehanded has the same animation, but is much harder.
  * The Bucker appeared in both _[Dark Souls](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Buckler "Dark Souls 2 Buckler")_ and in _[Dark Souls 3](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Buckler "Dark Souls 2 Buckler")_.
