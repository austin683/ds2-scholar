### How to get Bandit Greataxe in Dark Souls 2

  * Treasure pickup in [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"). Start from the first bonfire, proceed over the first bridge, be wary of the hole, and go over the second bridge. From the end of the second bridge, keep going along the left wall and drop down to the platform below. Cross the bridge, be wary of the exploding hollow. At the end of the bridge, keep going straight along the left side of the platform, and look down when you get to the end, preferably with a torch in hand. Drop down to the platform below. From here you only need to proceed along the only possible path. The axe is on a corpse in an urn near the top of a particularly long ladder.
