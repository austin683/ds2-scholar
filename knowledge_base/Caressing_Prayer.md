> 
> Affects both the caster and nearby allies.
> 
> This spell was recently developed, and may not be an authentic miracle."

### Acquired From

  * Purchase from [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt") and [Cromwell the Pardoner](/Cromwell+the+Pardoner "Dark Souls 2 Cromwell the Pardoner") for 2000 souls.

### Caressing Prayer Notes

  * Removes poison and toxic buildup. Allies have approximately 2 seconds after you finish casting to get in range. Also removes all poison soaking into your clothing. This makes it a useful and infinite replacement for Poison Moss in high-poison areas such as Harvest Valley, Earthen Peak, The Gutter, and Black Gulch.
