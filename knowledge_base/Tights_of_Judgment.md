**Location:**   

  * The Judgement Set can be found after the first Drakekeeper in the Dragon Shrine. After you killed him, there are boxes and behind them is a Pharros' Contraption. Activate this, and a magic wall appears on the side wall. Break it and open the chest for the Judgement set and the Staff of Wisdom.

  
**Notes:**   

  * Upgraded with Twinkling Titanite
  * The appearance and item description of this set indicates that these were the clothes worn by Cromwell the Pardorner and Oswald of Carim in the previous game. (Oswald is an NPC with the ability to absolve a player of Sin)
