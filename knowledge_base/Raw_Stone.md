**Raw Stone** is a type of [Upgrade Material](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**.**Raw Stone** , a modified variant of titanite. When applied, it alters a weapon's class to Raw. Not applicable to shields. This exceptionally durable titanite increases a weapon's physical attack potency while diminishing the impact of strength and dexterity bonuses. [Upgrade Materials](/Upgrades "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades") are items that are used to strengthen the statistical value and to increase the effect of a certain piece of equipment.

### Dark Souls 2 Raw Stone Usage

  * Can only be used at Blacksmith [Steady Hand McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff")
  * Used to change a weapons class to Raw. This increases the weapon's base damage but removes all scaling.
  * Adds approximately +6% to the chosen weapon's all-around attack stats. _(Note: Almost every time, there's a better option available for a certain weapon. Make sure that the damage bonus you get from this stone is worth losing ALL the scaling a weapon has.)_
  * Crossbows are a good choice for this upgrade as they don't have scaling.
  * Also a good choice for [Santier's Spear](/Santiers+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Santiers Spear"), as it has no scaling whatsoever. (However, once you get 50+ int, Enchanted will start to outscale Raw.)
