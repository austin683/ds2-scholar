### Soul of a Giant Notes & Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * It is possible to farm Souls of A Giant from the [Ancient Dragon.](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon") Use [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at the [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine") to make him respawn again.
  * [Great Lightning Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear") with high faith does a lot of damage. 
    * The staff hex [Dark Orb](/Dark+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Dark Orb"), despite its short range, is very effective against giants when considering how quickly it can be cast, and the number of casts it naturally provides.
    * The miracle hex [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Great Resonant Soul") is very effective against them as well.
    * Giants are fairly easy if you poison them. They don't take an incredible amount of damage, but if you can get them poisoned when you need to run or heal yourself, it can prove to be a boon to your survival and ending the fight quicker.
  * You keep the soul of giants into NG+
  * **No longer works after[Patch 1.10](/Patch+1.10 "Dark Souls 2 Patch 1.10") but can be used in unpatched version** If the player has accidentally used all of their Souls' of A Giant, or they simply require more to defeat Vendrick, the two Giants in Black Gulch can be farmed for subsequent Souls' of A Giant with the use of a Bonfire Ascetic on the Black Gulch _Mouth_ bonfire. This method can also be used to obtain an infinite number of them, should the player desire to do so.
  * There is a bug wherein if you kill only 1 of the giants in the hidden cave within [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch") then you are summoned to the Belfry Sol by the [Bell Keepers' Seal](/Bell+Keeper's+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Bell Keeper's Seal"), upon returning you will be given the [Forgotten Key](/Forgotten+Key "Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Key") and a [Soul of a Giant](/Soul+of+a+Giant "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Giant"), although killing the other giant does not result in a second Soul of a Giant or Forgotten Key being dropped. (Unsure if this is only if you lose the invasion or if you can win and have the same result.)(<\---- Not specific to Belfry Sol, any form of quit-loading will have the same effect.)
