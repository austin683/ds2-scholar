### DS2 Ring of Thorns Tips and Notes

  * Ring's effect is proc based, meaning that the effect will not trigger every time the player is hit. It deals physical damage in a 180 degree cone the direction the wearer is facing using bolts/projectiles, the same way a crossbow trap in a chest works. This means if you're too close when it procs you can be hit by multiple bolts, each one dealing roughly 200 damage (that's about how much I was hit, not sure if this was scaling off of stats). Does not appear to trigger when taking damage while blocking with a non-100% shield.
