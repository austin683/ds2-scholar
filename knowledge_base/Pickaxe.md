Pickaxe **is a non-traditional weapon that is primarily used for mining but can also deal significant damage in combat. It is acquired by leading a boar through Brightstone Cove Tseldora, which involves a specific sequence of events and requires careful management of the boar's aggro. The **Pickaxe** can be upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") and cannot be infused with Bleed.

> A Pickaxe used for mining. Not intended as a weapon, but packs a powerful punch.

>  This tool, designed to crush hard rock, can easily puncture weaker forms of armor.

### How to get Pickaxe in Dark Souls 2

  * [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"), mini-quest: You must guide one of the boars from the [Royal Army Campsite](/Royal+Army+Campsite "Dark Souls 2 Royal Army Campsite") bonfire all the way down towards the end of the level, past the boss Magus & Congregation and across the spikes. On the room where you are ambushed by ceiling-spiders, right before the dark room with many spiderwebs, there are mushrooms in the middle that will be eaten by the pig, revealing the pickaxe. 
    * Tips: Don't lose it's aggro. The best strategy is to stand near your boar, close enough for him to follow you but doesn't attack, because when he attacks he eventually loses aggro.
    * Killing everything which is on the way to the mushrooms is a good idea, maybe even the spiders in the room because he takes a bit time to eat the mushrooms. This will mean killing some enemies at the bottom of the cove enough times to de-spawn them as there is no easy way back up after clearing the level.
    * If the piglet dies you don't need to burn an ascetic to have him spawning again, the mushrooms don't respawn though, even after burning a bonfire ascetic. They are available in regular NG+
    * The [Redeye Ring](/Redeye+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Redeye Ring") is invaluable here as the pig will only lose you if you wander ridiculously far away. Once he sees you, he will follow you. Recommended: Clear the path all the way to the bonfire after Magnus and then put on the ring and draw him in. Instead of going down the stairs near the fire, take the cliff area and jump across to where Pate and Creighton fight. The pig will make many unexpected jumps and follow you anyway. After going through the building recommended above you may recall you will end up in the area with the humanoid spider enemies and two basilisks.
    * If the pickaxe drops and you die before you collect it, you can still find it on the ground after respawn.
    * possible drop from the red phantom peasant (he can be respawned with bonfire ascetics so you can farm him)

### DS2 Pickaxe Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite"). Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * Note that it deals thrusting damage and it does benefit from the [Old Leo Ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring").
  * Has a small range, attacks mostly only the front by smashing it into the ground, roll attack and second 2H R2 are the only wide swings
  * After Calibration 1.08, the Pickaxe no longer does two instance. Highly recommended to go for two handed R1 attack combo instead,

  
**Trivia:**

  * Note that pigs also dig things up in real life, people use them to hunt truffles, and this is exactly what the boar is doing upon seeing the mushrooms.
  * The way of acquiring the pickaxe may also loosely related to Fairy Fossil from _King's Field 2_.
