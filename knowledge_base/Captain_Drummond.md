### Captain Drummond Dialogue

**\- When first meeting**  
What are you doing here?  
You are not one of our soldiers. And I don't take you for a mercenary.  
Whoever you are, this is no battle to involve yourself in.  
Whether you are guided by bravery, or brashness, this is no place for you.

**\- When talking a second time**  
I am Drummond, and the Lord has placed this fort in my hands.  
Whoever you are, I forgive your trespass. But leave this place immediately.  
Just mention my name, and no man will challenge your exit.  
And even if you don't, by now, my men have not the will to resist.

**\- When talking a third time**  
Soon, the Giants will descend upon this fort.  
It is revenge, for the Kingdom's misguided barbarism.  
The venerable Lord built this kingdom to bring prosperity to His subjects.  
What has transformed him so, I can not imagine.

**\- When talking a fourth time**  
Long ago, the King crossed the seas, pillaged the land of Giants, and brought back a "prize".  
It was then that the golems materialised.  
The Giants are no ordinary barbarians. A singular rage burns within their hearts.  
My father, and his father, both fought the Giants on this very land.  
The Giants have wills of steel.  
They cannot find it within themselves… To forgive the misdeeds of our lord.

**\- When talking a fifth time**  
Did you see him? That towering monster among them.  
That is most certainly their King.  
He will be a thing to topple, hah hah hah hah, even if I should die trying!  
My blade may break, my arrows fall wide, but my will shall never be broken.  
Those who live by the sword will die by it, and I, Drummond, won't go down without drawing mine!

**\- When talking a sixth time**  
Be gone with you, this fort will soon fall.  
Be gone, before the Giants are entirely upon us.

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
Take these. I think you may just need them.  
Don't ask me why. I just do.

**\- When attacked but not aggroed**  
Erg!  
(or)  
How dare you!  
(or)  
Enough with this madness!

**\- When attacked and aggroed**  
You dare to mock me!

**\- When killing the player**  
What a waste.

**\- When re-encountered after aggroing**  
Are you determined to die?

**\- When attacked and health is under 50%**  
Hmph! How very sporting!

**\- When killed**  
I..I am…bested…

**\- Unknown**  
Matters are settled…

### Dark Souls 2 Captain Drummond Trivia

  * It is speculated that the corpse with the [Drangleic Set](/Drangleic+Set "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Set") found by the player underneath the boss arena for [The Pursuer](/The+Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 The Pursuer") belongs to Captain Drummond, which would explain why the set is found without a helmet - the helmet was given to the player in the past, and absent from the corpse in the present.
