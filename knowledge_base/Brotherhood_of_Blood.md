**Brotherhood of Blood** is a PvP covenant in **Dark Souls 2**. It is a dueling covenant that is focused around 3 dedicated arena venues.

  
**Covenant Leader** : [ Titchy Gren ](/Gren "Dark Souls 2 Gren")   
**Location** : [ Undead Purgatory](/Undead+Purgatory "Dark Souls 2 Undead Purgatory")

## How to Join Brotherhood of Blood

The covenant leader, [ Titchy Gren](/Gren "Dark Souls 2 Gren"), can be spoken to in a small area found after the [ Executioner's Chariot ](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses") boss fight. The player must have a [ Token of Spite ](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite") in their possession before speaking to the covenant leader in order to join.

### Dueling:

Upon joining the covenant, players can queue for duels at the three statues near Gren. Again, a [ Token of Spite ](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite") must be present in the inventory in order to duel. The token will not be expended; it need only be present.   
When facing the statues, the three arenas are as follows:

  * **Left statue** : A relatively long bridge that connects one side to another. Falling off the bridge will result in death.
  * **Middle statue** : A labyrinthine arena with two levels. There are stairs in the four corners of the arena which lead to the second level.
  * **Right statue** : A large circular stage with wooden scaffolding in the center. There are steps that lead to the top of the structure.

  
Note: If no one is currently available at a chosen arena, the player will be paired with a duelist in either of the other two arenas.

### Rank

To improve rank for this covenant the player must achieve victory in the dueling arenas _or_ vanquish blue phantoms summoned by members of the [ Way of Blue ](/Way+of+the+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Way of the Blue") during an invasion.   
Being defeated in a duel will result in the loss of one rank point. However, according to Namco Bandai customer support, it is not possible to lose rank by failing an invasion.

  * When invading, defeat the Blue Sentinel summoned as help,   
and the devotion to the covenant will go up +2. (Added with [Patch 1.10](/Patch+1.10 "Dark Souls 2 Patch 1.10"))
  * You do NOT gain rank from successful invasions.

    
    
    | Rank | Requirement | Reward |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0 | 1 Token of Spite | Crest of Blood |
    | 1 | 50 rank points | Curved Twinblade ; aesthetic red aura as a dark spirit |
    | 2 | 150 rank points | Crescent Sickle ; aesthetic neon red glow as a dark spirit |
    | 3 | 500 rank points | Great Chaos Fireball , Gren Set , Scythe of Nahr Alma |
    

### Notes

  * Using the 'Talk' option with [Titchy Gren, ](/Gren "Dark Souls 2 Gren")after reaching rank 3 in the covenant, will cause him to give you his scythe and armor set.
  * If both players have full health when the duel timer ends in the arena, the duel ends in a draw, and the message "STALEMATE" will appear.
  * It is recommended that player record their own victories and defeats in dueling arenas, because the game does not.
  * As of regulation 1.08, healing items and spell restoration items such as [Amber Herb](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb") can no longer be used during a duel. [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder") can still be used in order to counter corrosive weapon, or for infinite casts of special attacks.
  * You still can heal by casting healing miracles such as [Great Heal](/Great+Heal "Dark Souls 2 Great Heal") or the healing pyromancy [Warmth](/Warmth "Dark Souls 2 Warmth"), or by certain equipment like the [Ring of Restoration](/Ring+of+Restoration "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Restoration"), [Loyce Shield](/Loyce+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Shield"), [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King+helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King helm"), but also upon each successful hit of [Butcher's Knife](/Butcher%27s+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Butcher%27s Knife").
  * While fighting in the arena, with a duel that ends in both players defeat. The victory will be given to the player who died last.
  * Unlike other pvp, covenant arenas do not pair players up according to soul memory. Players can be paired up with anyone in the same play through. [I fought the same guy two times in a row using two different characters (150SL and 200SL). So keep in mind that Soul Level doesn't mean much here.]
