## Drangleic Castle Enemies

  

  

###  [The Pursuer](/Pursuer)

  

A giant, aggressive knight that "pursues" the player. Can be encountered in multiple locations -- see [The Pursuer](/Pursuer). The Pursuer can be first encountered on the large terrace outside the [Cardinal Tower bonfire](/Cardinal+Tower). The Pursuer then moves to a later location: behind a fog gate at the top of the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants), and this is where most players first face The Pursuer in a boss fight. It's other appearances are not explicit boss fights, and do not grant as many souls as the first encounter. In NG+, the Pursuer will appear more regularly. 

  

  

###  [Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight)

  

Giant mastadon-like knights. These heavy armor brutes comes in two variants: the Golden ones in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle) and the decayed rusted ones in [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros). They are all armed with giant Halberds.   
  
_One of the original Primal Knights, this ragged creature went Hollow long ago and now wanders mindlessly with its equipment in tatters from long years of neglect. First created through a dark and forbidden ritual in ages past, the Primal Knights are artificial creatures contrived by a twisted and power-hungry mind. Their susceptibility to the Undead Curse, a trait they share with humans, raises foreboding questions about the rituals through which they were given life..._

  

  

###  [Alonne Knight Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain)

  

The Alonne Captains are similar to their subordinates, except they are clad in heavier armor and are physically larger. Using larger, lightning-enchanted Katanas (upon closer inspection the sword more resembles the Ivory King Ultra Greatsword) and the same greatbows as the Knights at their command, Alonne Captains are much more dangerous foes since they tend to go for quickdraw to strike within a split second, though they share the same vulnerabilities. Periodically, when a player gets inside a Captain's natural sword range, the Captain may use unarmed strikes to stun or disrupt the player.   
  
Some Alonne Captains do not carry greatbows (especially Red Phantom version seen at higher bonfire intensity), they'll actively pursue the player and utilize quickdraws, a minor trivia, their shoulder paldron loosely resemble Nineball from the original _Armored Core_ , the red unmaned AC in From Software's early title, this can be seen when Alonne Captains are coated with Red Phantom aura at higher bonfire intensity. 

  

  

###  [Stone Soldier](/Stone+Soldier)

  

The Stone Soldier is an enemy in Dark Souls II. It can first be encountered in the large room beside the castle entrance bonfire   

  * Soldiers remain motionless in a kneeling position and do not attack players until they draw close.
  * After being approached, soldiers will go through a lengthy ~3 second animation where they come to life and become hostile.

  

  

###  [Ruin Sentinel](/Ruin+Sentinel)

  

Very tall and lithe, the Ruin Sentinel is armored from head to toe in what looks to be bronze. It has a narrow helmet slit, giving it a something of a robot-like appearance. These enemies are extremely fast for their size, and come at the player with a variety off attacks, many notable for their wide hit potential. There are three named Ruin Sentinels, Alessia, Ricce, and Yahim, who make up the the boss fight in the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille): three Sentinels fought in a room: one on the platform near the entrance, and two below on the ground. See the [Ruin Sentinel page](/Ruin+Sentinel) for boss fight details and other encounters. 

  

  

###  [Royal Swordsman](/Royal+Swordsman)

  

_The Royal Swordsman were chosen from the bravest of King Vendrick's men, and provided them with the best armor available for the war against the Giants. However, very few survived the battles. While they may be no match for Giants, they still pose a threat when they attack you in numbers_   
  
Royal Swordsmen are encountered in [The Lost Bastille](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Lost+Bastille) and [Drangleic Castle](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Drangleic+Castle). They are often found in teams of around 3-4 soldiers and they will work together to overwhelm the player. They wield greatswords and crossbows.   
Though both of them look alike, the Castle variant are more aggressive and can do more damage. Standing their ground when using the crossbow and switching weapons only when the player approaches within a few units of distance.   
  
They are weak to Thrust (i.e. Spears) type attacks. 

  

  

###  [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier) (Royal Guard)

  

_High-ranking Drangleic knights whose weapons and armor are modeled after those borne by Sir Syan, one of King Vendrick's bravest military leaders. Sir Syan met a dishonorable end on the battlefield during the war with the Giants;' shortly thereafter all of the knights who had been issued replicas of his armor went insane after putting them on._   
  
Equipped with greatswords or halberds, these knights are also equipped with greatshields as well. They wear Syan's Set of armor, and have special lightning attacks they use rarely. 

  

  

###  [Executioner's Chariot](/Executioner%27s+Chariot)

  

Like the name describes Executioner's Chariot, the boss is actually the Chariot and not the skeleton riding it. This boss has two phases. The Death Chase phase and the Fighting Phase. While in the Death Chase phase he will constantly ride in a circular motion around the map, in the fighting phase you will combat the two headed horse that pulls the Chariot.   
  
The boss is stronger and more difficult as any NG+ enemy/boss but so are the enemies (on the pillars) preceding the fight. Be wary and prepared for the mobs before the boss. 

  

  

###  [Old Knight](/Old+Knight)

  

Old Knights are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered immediately after entering [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame) through the [Majula](/Majula) waterway.   

  * Old Knights are giant sentinels from an ancient time, when the Heide Kingdom reigned. They are reminiscent of the brass giants from Dark Souls I
  * Old Knights have fairly high HP, damage output, and staggering attacks, but slow movement and attack speed 
  * Old Knights may use ultra greatswords, swords and shields, or great hammers. They all have telegraphed and relatively slow swing speeds
  * Old Knights cannot be staggered, backstabbed, or parried. But they are fairly easy to circle strafe, and their attacks are easy to roll through
  * Old Knights are weak against magic and strike (i.e. mace) type attacks

  

  

###  [Drakekeeper Knight Phantom](/Drakekeeper+Knight+Phantom)

  

Guards the entrance to the castle, wearing Drakekeeper's armour and holding a Warpick as a weapon 

  

  

###  [Washing Pole Phantom](/Washing+Pole+Phantom)

  

A Red Spirit guarding the Embedded 

  

  

###  [Greatbow Phantom](/Greatbow+Phantom)

  

_The hero Durgo, an expert bowman, and his brother-in-law defended their homeland from aggressors. In spite of Lanafir's policy of isolationism, Durgo was well known even beyond its domain_   
  
Only appears in the original Dark Souls II. 

  

  

###  [Nameless Usurper](/Nameless+Usurper)

  

_A mysterious woman clad in the robes of a Lindelt cleric. Her enigmatic appearance and her presence in Drangleic Castle leave more questions than answers…_

  

  

###  [Forlorn](/Forlorn)

  

_Born of Aldia's Obsession with the First Sin, the Forlorn lost both their corporeal form and a world to call their own. Now they drift into other worlds, ever in search of a home. But without self, one has neither beginning nor end, and so the Forlorn have only to wander._
