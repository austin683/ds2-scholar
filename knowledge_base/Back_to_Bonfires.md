# Table of Contents

Bonfires act as checkpoint and travel portals. Upon dying, the player will respawn at the last bonfire they kindled or rested at and lose the souls they were carrying. Players may also light torches at the bonfire, allowing them some light in dark areas. Players may teleport to any bonfire in the game that they have kindled. In SOtFS, Aldia will come out of the bonfire after you light the last of the four Primal Bonfires, then at the first bonfire in Undead Crypt and the Dragon Shrine bonfire.
