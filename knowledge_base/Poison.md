**Poison** is a [Status Effect](/Status+Effects "Dark Souls 2 Status Effects") in **Dark Souls 2**. It is a deadly damage over time (DoT) effect that drains the [HP](/HP "Dark Souls 2 HP") of those afflicted with it once it is procced. The player has an innate Poison Resistance stat affected by [Adaptability](/Adaptability "Dark Souls 2 Adaptability") and [Vitality](/Vitality "Dark Souls 2 Vitality"), capping at 200 Poison Resist when both stats are 99. Other sources for Poison Resistance will have to come from spells and equipment, capping at 890 Poison Resist.

### Dark Souls 2 Poison Guide

In order to inflict Poison, the buildup meter must be filled, and once it has the target will take 1,050/1,095 damage over 22 seconds. The amount of poison buildup one does with each attack to fill up the buildup meter is affected by the Poison Attack Bonus stat, which is increased by raising [Adaptability](/Adaptability "Dark Souls 2 Adaptability") and [Dexterity](/Dexterity "Dark Souls 2 Dexterity"). [Sanctum Soldier Gauntlets](/Sanctum+Soldier+Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier Gauntlets") and [Crest of the Rat](/Crest+of+the+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Crest of the Rat") increase poison buildup on weapons that have either innate poison or are infused with it:  
Weapons with innate Poison get 50 points of extra buildup.  
Weapons infused with Poison get 25 points of extra buildup.  
Weapons with innate Poison and infused with Poison get 60 points of extra buildup.  
These items stack, so wearing both of them and using a Poison-infused weapon grants 2(60) = 120 points of extra buildup.
