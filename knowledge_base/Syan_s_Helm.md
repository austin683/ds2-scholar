_"Replica of the armor of the loyal knight Syan. This solidly-crafted gear offers high defense._

_Sir Syan was widely known as the Kingdom's most loyal knight, and when the Giants invaded, he volunteered to lead the advance party, but he was slaughtered most dishonorably._

_The King commissioned replicas of Syan's accoutrements and bestowed them on promising knights, but not long after they donned the armor did most go thoroughly mad."_
