###  **Acquired From**

  * Dropped by the Great Hammer wielding [Drakekeepers](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper") in [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine")

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite"). Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * As of regulation 1.08 this weapon has exactly same AR as [Demon's Great hammer](/Demon%27s+Great+hammer#fex "Dark Souls 2 Demon%27s Great hammer#fex") when fully upgraded, and weighs 6 units less.
  * This weapon responds very well to infusion, at +10 with 50 strength it has gains a B scaling in Strength alongside a B scaling in whatever element you choose to infuse. This makes the total AR 315/315 in both physical and elemental damage.
