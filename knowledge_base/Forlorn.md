**Forlorn** is an [enemy](/enemies "Dark Souls 2 enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. Borne from Aldia's fixation on the First Sin, the **Forlorn** have lost both physical form and a world to call their own. Drifting into other realms, they endlessly search for a home. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Dark Souls 2 Forlorn Information

_"Born of Aldia's Obsession with the First Sin, the Forlorn lost both their corporeal form and a world to call their own. Now they drift into other worlds, ever in search of a home. But without self, one has neither beginning nor end, and so the Forlorn have only to wander.__"_

### Forlorn Strategy Tips in DKS2

  * There are two variants of Forlorn that will invade the player. One wields a greatsword while the other posesses a scythe. Both used to be female, according to their character model.
  * Like many invading NPCs the Forlorn will make use of evasive maneuvers, such as rolling and backstepping, along with parrying and jumping attacks to bring the player down.
  * They can be stunlocked by sorceries, however if the player is unable to stunlock them or misses, there is a high chance the Forlorn will follow up with an attack while the player is vulnerable to deal massive damage.
  * They will actively dodge through spells, using melee attacks instead is highly recommended.
  * They seemingly rotate through strategies, one of which being in guard mode for a set amount of time. In guard mode they circle around you while holding their weapon up. Use this opportunity to perform a guard break on them and deal massive amounts of damage by using the counter attack animation. They will never attack while guarding during this time, so you don't have to worry about a surprise attack. When they move towards you with their guard up, they are NOT in guard mode so pay attention.

### Forlorn Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * While attempting to force a spawn, it's recommended to add and select your Homeward Bone, Aged Feather or Darksign on your belt, since they become unavailable for use during an invasion. As soon as an invasion is not triggered you should use any of those items and repeat.
  * If you choose Darksign, consider using the [Agape Ring](/Agape+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Agape Ring") with it to protect your soul memory.
  * Each randomly spawned and defeated Forlorn unlocks a piece of their armor for purchase at [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis"). You cannot unlock their weapons before unlocking their armor first. You must defeat a scythe variant Forlorn after defeating 4 chance spawned forlorns in order to unlock the [Scythe of the Forlorn](/Scythe+of+the+Forlorn "Dark Souls 2 Scythe of the Forlorn"). Same goes for the greatsword. The unlock progression carries over to NG+.

### Location

  * [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") (chance to spawn in the hallway blocked by the two undead wielding giant shields. TP: the room where you fight Lici-_cough_ Nameless Usurper.)
  * [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana") (chance to spawn on the ridge accessed through a wooden door inside the [Tower of Prayer](/Tower+of+Prayer "Dark Souls 2 Tower of Prayer"). TP: the end of the ridge where the chest and basilisk is)
  * [Shulva, Sanctum City](/Shulva+-+Sanctum+City "Dark Souls 2 Shulva - Sanctum City") (chance to spawn at the lower end of the stairs that lead down to the bridge that Sinh airstrikes upon first approach. TP: the beginning/top of the stairs or the middle)

### Move Set

  * **Among the Forlorn's many moves, two of them have the potential to go pass your shield and do some damage. An overhead attack and the back sweep both can bypass the player's shield's defenses to inflict some damage**

### Drops

  * [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy")
