**Heal** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle.

> "A healing miracle widely used by clerics.  
> Slightly restores HP.
> 
> To use miracles, equip a sacred chime and attune a miracle at a bonfire."

### Acquired From

  * Purchase from Licia of Lindeldt and Merchant Hag Melentia for 1500 souls.

### Notes

  * This basic healing spell actually has the second largest AoE next to Great Heal. If you start as a Cleric, it is possible to acquire 9 uses of this spell, due to the fact that you can buy the spell from the Merchant Hag Melentia and Licia of Lindeldt, this can be increased to a maximum of 12 uses if you use the Saint's Hood, also acquired from Licia of Lindeldt after you level your faith to or past 30.
  * Spell also affects allies that step into range very shortly after you finish casting.
  * Cast can be held to delay activation and allow for allies to enter the range of the cast.
