**Builds** or **Character Builds** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are very specific recommendations of how to _build_ your character, from the creation of your character, the skills points spent throughout the game and the specific Magic & Equipment the player should obtain, all that works best to reach a certain goal. Users are able to share their suggested builds, share their chosen stats and equipment for optimized play. Players have created these builds, so their viability to different scenarios will vary. If you are interested on sharing a new build, you are more than welcome to add it to our wiki.

### Create your Build in Dark Souls 2 

Character Building is about coordinating your [stats](/stats "Dark Souls 2 stats"), [equipment](/equipment "Dark Souls 2 equipment") and [magic](/magic "Dark Souls 2 magic") with your play-style. It is recommended to decide on a few factors before thinking of a build:

  * What is this character for? PvE? PvP? Will it co-op?
  * What kind of role will this character play? Offensive? Defensive? Balanced?
  * What [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory") will this character play at? Is the gear you want available in NG or [NG+](/new+game+plus "Dark Souls 2 new game plus")?
  * Is this build for beginners, intermediate or advanced players?

Once you have this general idea, you can think about the equipment you want to provide for your character in detail. You should consider [stamina](/stamina "Dark Souls 2 stamina"), [poise](/poise "Dark Souls 2 poise") and other mechanics outlaid in the [Combat](/Combat "Dark Souls 2 Combat") page before deciding.
