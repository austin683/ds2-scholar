**Pate's Shield** is a [Greatshield](/Greatshields "Dark Souls 2 Greatshields") in Dark Souls 2. **Greatshields** can be used not only to block an enemy but allows player to do **shield bash**(Great shields replaced parry ability with heavy shield bash).

     _"Pate's favorite greatshield. Appears rather humdrum, but in fact was forged by layering thin sheets of iron,  
a process that creates a shield with excellent defense for its weight._

     _It is not always advisable to stand out. Especially if you have something to hide."_

### Acquired From:

  * Kill [Mild Mannered Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate") and it will become available via [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") for 5800 souls.
  * If you summon Pate to assist with [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant") boss fight (below [Cardinal Tower](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower")) and keep him alive throughout the fight, then when you meet him in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") he will give it to you, along with his full armor set and spear. 

### Pate's Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Pate has an unique way of using his shield, it looks like he has it strapped to his forearm while the player uses the shields handle to carry it.
  * Also used by the Grey Phantom NPCs that burst out of mirrors in Aldia and are summoned by the [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Knight").
