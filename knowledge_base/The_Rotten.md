### NPC Summons

#### Lucatiel of Mirrah

[Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah") can be summoned for this fight, provided the player has exhausted her dialogue in the hidden pathway in the [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch"). Her summon sign is located near the [Hidden Chamber](/Hidden+Chamber "Dark Souls 2 Hidden Chamber").   
Lucatiel, as in all of her appearances, can be very useful during this fight by distracting the boss. She will not do a large amount of damage, but she does have a vast health pool and can withstand a pretty good beating while the player deals damage to the Rotten.

#### Lone Hunter Schmidt

[Lone Hunter Schmidt](/Lone+Hunter+Schmidt "Dark Souls 2 Lone Hunter Schmidt") can be summoned for this fight. His summon sign is located before the Razorback Nightcrawlers, near jars.  
Schmidt is not especially durable and doesn't do very much damage, but he can still be useful as a distraction while the player attacks.

#### Bashful Ray

[Bashful Ray](/Bashful+Ray "Dark Souls 2 Bashful Ray") can be summoned as a Shade between the two Razorback Nightcrawlers near Lone Hunter Schmidt's sumon sign.

### Strategies

Wear light armor with the [Old Leo Ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring") and use a thrusting weapon (for example, a [Rapier](/Rapier "Dark Souls 2 Rapier")). Since his attacks are very slow, there is a larger window to take advantage of the Leo Ring's counterattack damage bonus. Roll from his attacks and just jab away but keep an eye on your stamina. Keep in the middle so the flames can't hit you.

  * #### Arm chopping strategy

Using a weapon with an arcing overhead attack can make it easier to remove his limbs. A Bastard Sword one handed heavy attack (R2 on PS3 and RT on Xbox) was effective at doing this and caused heavy damage. If an arm is lost he will still try to attack with it but it will be meaningless to the player. If left alone for too long he will regrow the limb.   
Keep load weight under 55% for effective dodge rolls. Armor not necessary, shield should be used for absorbing minor damage taken.   
Line boss up with a pathway that has no fire pits either behind or in front of you, utilize this as your fighting area (as if on a narrow bridge). KEEP A LOOK OUT for overhead swinging attacks, you need to be vigilant and notice when he's readying his swing. After most attacks you will have 1 or 2 hit window in which you can hit and immediately dodge or walk backwards to avoid damage. *Suggestion, when boss uses Acid Spit use it to utilize heavy hits.

  * #### Easy spell strategy

Equip Lion armor for casting speed buff, priest hoodie really helps to get more spellcasts. Any type of magic works, you have to be a little bit good at pulling off dodges, just don't be afraid. In particular, Soul Vortex is incredibly effective due to his large frame allowing the vortex to hit many times. Bait him to attack if needed, be aware and watch your bars. Check the second video for the kill footage.

  * #### Poke strategy

Wear light armor, and wield a very long ranged fast melee weapon, such as a spear, lance, or Halberd. Walk close to him and bait an attack, then quickly back up to evade it, rolls aren't necessary and can even be dangerous. While using light armor simply sprinting back should be enough to dodge his attacks. After he attacks poke him for some damage, heal, or get away from walls. This strategy is great for dodging every attack he has except cone wave, which can either be blocked by a powerful shield or dodged, though be mindful of the fire pits. Please note; locking on to this boss is a bad idea, and this strategy is best used with weapons that deal heavy damage in 1 hit rather than damage over time.

  * #### Co-op strategy

Best implemented with a phantom being the melee bait for ranged/casters. Bait gets The Rotten to aggro on him and begins to circle without locking on. The Rotten will often keep focus on the bait and follow across the arena allowing him to be drawn away from walls and other players. This also allows the bait to stay just out of range of his melee attacks while still distracting him if desired( works best if other players are ranged/casting to prevent an unexpected shift of aggro). If he moves to attack another player then the bait dashes in an hits him until he follows the bait again. In the event the host is also melee then the bait just circles close in to The Rotten while the other players attack from the other side and repositions The Rotten as needed. - Priority of the bait should be keeping The Rotten's attention over doing damage with most attacks following the Poke strategy.

  * #### Miracle strategy

Heavenly Thunder miracle can easily cheese this boss to near death. 4 casts of Heavenly Thunder (44 faith) will reduce the boss' hp to 1/3 of its maximum health.

  * #### Greatsword Strategy

Bring the boss to center of the arena and lock on. Stay close and rotate clockwise. By doing this, you can out-turn him and most of his attacks will miss, allowing you to deliver 1-2 strikes after each. With luck, you will be able to chop off his sword arm this way. Be wary of his AoE attack, which will still hit you reliably.

  * #### Soul level 1 strategy (mace)

Run up to him and lock on. You should circle his right all the time, baiting his attacks and rolling through. His recovery is slow enough to get a few hits in, but don't be greedy. Keep doing this until he's got about half his HP left, when will start doing his AoE attack. This will kill you if you are too close. After each of your attacks, lock off and run away from him. He may do his AoE attack, but if you are far enough you will be safe. Following this method, you can gradually chop his HP away while taking no damage, granted you dodge well.

#### **The Rotten Video Strategies in DKS2**

### The Rotten Hints in DKS2

  * When trying to cut off The Rotten's arms, try to fight without locking-on. You could also use a weapon with good vertical reach.
  * The Rotten is immune to Dark Fog and Toxic Mist.
  * The Rotten has high resistances to non-physical damage, but has a weakness to thrust damage. Try using a rapier or a spear for a good damage output.
  * When backing up, The Rotten will move his left hand in front of him. Long reach weapons such as spears can attack the hand at least once per animation without fear of a retaliatory attack.

### Dark Souls 2 The Rotten Bugs

  * If you are on the fire and he grabs you, you'll continue to take damage from the fire for a few seconds after. He'll then hurt you with his grab attack and it's basically a 1-Hit KO.

### The Rotten Trivia in Dark Souls 2

  * The Rotten's moveset is modeled after Gravelord Nito from _Dark Souls_ , of whom he is a reincarnation.
  * There is a lone person sticking out of The Rotten's left shoulder. This is possibly Pharros, who is likely controlling each move The Rotten makes. (Needs Confirmation)
  * The Rotten shares some of Nito's movesets, such as dark explosion, grapple attack, and the way he swings his knife (or possibly related to Milldred).
  * During the opening cutscene, it is trying to replace a broken statue's head, suggesting it cares for the statues, or where it lives.
