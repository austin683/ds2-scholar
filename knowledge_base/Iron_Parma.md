**Iron Parma** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing. 

     _"A small shield made of iron. The unusual design suggests a foreign origin._

     _Lightweight despite its iron construction, and sturdy despite its small size, but not sufficient to protect one from real danger."_

### Acquired From:

    * Buy from [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") for 1200 souls.

### Iron Parma Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * You may want to use this shield if you're considering using the [Silver Eagle Kite Shield](/Silver+Eagle+Kite+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Silver Eagle Kite Shield") as, aside from 5 more physical defense, the Iron Parma is either equal or superior stat-wise and benefits from the increased parry frames of a small shield.
  * Its description and likeness may be a reference to Shiva of the East's [Iron Round Shield](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Round+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Iron Round Shield") from _Dark Souls_ , and likewise the [Eastern Iron Shield](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Eastern+Iron+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Eastern Iron Shield") in _Dark Souls 3_.
