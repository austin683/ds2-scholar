### Alonne Captain Gauntlets Description

_"Gauntlets worn by Sir Alonne,_  
_who served the Old Iron King._

_Sir Alonne came to this land from the east,_  
_chose to serve a little-known and unestablished_  
 _lord, and helped him become the Old Iron King._

_Then, at the end of the very peak of his sire's rule,_  
_Sir Alonne set out again, in search of_  
 _lands yet unknown"_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Sold by [Magerold of Lanafir](/Magerold+of+Lanafir) after defeating [Sir Alonne](/Sir+Alonne).

### 

### Notes

  * There are only 2 Alonne Captain pieces (the helm and the chest-piece). The Gauntlets and Leggings are from the regular Alonne Knight set.
  * Upgraded with titanite shards.
  * Armor set has very good poise, and good defense for its weight.
  * The chest offers extremely high amount of fire resistance, highest in the game if fully upgraded for any heavy armor.
