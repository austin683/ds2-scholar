**Moon Butterfly Skirt** is a **Legging** and a part of [Moon Butterfly Set](/Moon+Butterfly+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Moon Butterfly Skirt Description

_"Skirt made from wings of the rare moon butterfly. Poisons those who approach its wearer."_  
_"Also extends jump distance."_  
_"Little is known about the moon butterfly, which only appears on full-moon nights in winter. Some say the butterfly is a magical being, and its larvae have never once been spotted."_  
  
_Effect(all): Poisons nearby foes_  
  
 _Wings/Skirt Effect:Increases length of jump_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * [Maughlin the Armorer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer), in [Majula](/Majula) (Only available in NG+ & the hat requires NG++ (bonfire intensity 3) after spending 16000+ souls with him.
  * In other words, you need to burn two Bonfire Ascetics in Majula to get the entire set)

### Notes

  * Poisons nearby foes, including Mimics in hiding.
  * Hat increases Intelligence by 1.
  * Each piece has a special effect (Effect(All): Poison nearby foes, Effect(Wings/Skirt): Increases length of jumping)
  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore)
  * Leaves poison buildup marking on invisible enemies (needs confirmation)(+confirmed pc 15/6/2014, though since the poison radius is short they're practically on top of you)
  * **IMPORTANT** : Take off before approaching any NPC you don't want to aggro. Poison will affect any NPC that you can attack, including the Emerald Herald.
  * When wearing the wings or the skirt you can jump without having to be sprinting first. 
    * It is still possible to roll in the opposite direction, and it is possible to backstep. This may save you in PVP.
    * Rolling to the side is possible, but very difficult. More often than not, you'll leap.
  * It is possible to immediately and consistently sprint and roll while wearing the wings without jumping simply by tapping forward before pressing the roll button
  * NOTE: this will not prevent you from dying from falls that would normally kill you
  * You can also hide the glove in a sleeve (e.g. Black Hollow Mage Robe) to poison your foe while unnoticed.
