**Syan Soldier** is an [enemy](/enemies "Dark Souls 2 enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Syan Soldiers** are knights donned in Syan's Set of armor, armed with greatswords or halberds, and shielded with greatshields.

### Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier Information

_"_ High-ranking Drangleic knights whose weapons and armor are modeled after those borne by Sir Syan, one of King Vendrick's bravest military leaders. Sir Syan met a dishonorable end on the battlefield during the war with the Giants;' shortly thereafter all of the knights who had been issued replicas of his armor went insane after putting them on.

Equipped with greatswords or halberds, these knights are also equipped with greatshields as well. They wear Syan's Set of armor, and have special lightning attacks they use rarely._"_

### Syan Soldier Strategy Tips in DKS2

  * Halberd knights can be backstabbed more around the arm they wield their halberd in, just around the elbow, while the sword ones are more around the right shoulder, their windows are small so make sure you have enough stamina to block or roll away if you miss
  * Ice Rapier seems very effective on them (thrusting weapons highly effective?)
