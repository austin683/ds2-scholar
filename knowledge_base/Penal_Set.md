**Penal Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Mask of the Lost Sinner. The spikes pointing inward suggest that this was not only used to blind prisoners, but to torture them as well.  
> Effect: Raises equipment load  
>    
> Straightjacket of the Lost Sinner. A tightly cinched belt presses against the waist.  
>   
> Handcuffs of the Lost Sinner. Increases the power of pyromancy. A device used to restrict use of the hands.  
> Effect: Raises power of pyromancies  
>    
> Skirt worn by the Lost Sinner. A tattered skirt that the guilty wear in shame.  
>   
> By now, no one knows who this was used to punish, or for what reason.

###  Set Location

  * Sold by [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") (29,5k) once [The Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner") is defeated (spend 15k souls at Maughlin's shop to unlock boss armor sets).

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Mask offers the highest fire defense.
  * Mask is the only piece offering Poise bonus. It also has increased durability compared to other pieces.
  * Mask increases equip load by ~3%. 
    * Test: 100.0 equip load without mask, 103.1 with it.
  * Handcuffs offer the highest fire defense (equal to that of [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon Set") gauntlets).
  * Handcuffs increase the strength of pyromancy by 7.4% (test results required).(7.4% seems to be correct, 779 Great Fireball damage with, and 725 damage without it, that's a 7.44% increase in damage, tested vs undead jailers and mounted overseers)
