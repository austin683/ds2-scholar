### Location

  * Invisible 
    * Spend 16,000 souls at [Maughlin's](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") shop in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") then return when you have zero souls. Talk to him, and he'll give you the set.
    * Armor can be dropped by Dark Spirit [Rhoy the Explorer](/Rhoy+the+Explorer "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy the Explorer") in [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints").

  * Visible 
    * The entire visible [Aurous Set](/Aurous+Set "Dark Souls 2 Aurous Set") drops from a [Dark Spirit](/Dark+Spirit "Dark Souls 2 Dark Spirit") at [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man's+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man's Wharf") on the ship in NG+ and above (_Spawns once per playthrough,[bonfire ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") required)_.
