### Damage Type Notes

  * If the player does not meet the requirements to wield a weapon, they can still use the weapon, but will deal much lower damage and for a few weapons won't be able to use the weapon art.
  * Regular Damage from _Dark Souls_ was removed going into DS2, leading to only three physical damage types.   
It is reintroduced as Standard Damage in the sequel _Dark Souls 3_.
