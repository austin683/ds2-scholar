**Manikin Claws** are **[Claw Weapons](/Fist+Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Fist Weapons")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Manikin Claws **differ from the default Claws by scaling with both [Strength](/Strength "Dark Souls 2 Strength") and [Dexterity](/Dexterity "Dark Souls 2 Dexterity"), while the default version focuses only on dexterity. To increase the chances of getting this rare drop, players can maximize their item discovery with specific gear. Additionally, infusing the claws with Bleed or Poison alters their damage and scaling

### How to get Manikin Claws in Dark Souls 2

  * A rare drop from three particular [Manikins](/Manikin "Dark Souls 2 Manikin") (the dextrous headless humanoids) in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley"). they are found by jumping off a ledge onto a very small platform right before the [Covetous Demon](/Covetous+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Demon")'s fog door. If the player misses the jump onto the platform, it's extremely likely that they will die.
  * Plunging attack will stop the roll animation when you land your jump, stopping you from rolling over the edge.
  * It is easier to get onto the platform if you run off the edge at an angle as opposed to trying make it by jumping
  * Compared to default claw, this one scales both strength and dexterity with C, while default [Claws](/Claws "Dark Souls 2 Claws") is dexterity dedicated.

### DS2 Manikin Claws Hints & Tips

  * Much like any other rare drop, it is recommended that the player max out their item discovery. This includes wearing either the [Jester Hat](/Jester's+Cap "Dark Souls 2 Jester's Cap"), [Travelling Merchant Hat](/Traveling+Merchant+Hat "Dark Souls 2 Traveling Merchant Hat"), or [Prisoner's Hood](/Prisoner%27s+Hood "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner%27s Hood"), along with the [Prisoner's Tatters](/Prisoner%27s+Tatters "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner%27s Tatters"), the highest available [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring"), and using a [Rusty Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin").
  * Infusing the claws with Bleed or Poison increases the weapons base physical damage but reduces scaling down to D. If the Manikin Claws are upgraded, the scaling for Strength will go up to C but Dexterity scaling remains D.
  * Scholar of the first sin. The claws have bleed effect innately.
