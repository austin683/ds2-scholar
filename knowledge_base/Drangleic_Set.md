**Drangleic Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
_"A traditional Drangleic helmet. Belonged to Captain Drummond._   
_In his day, King Vendrick was fair and just, and expected the same of his liegemen._   
_This helm was proof of King Vendrick's trust, an honor, until his transfiguration."_   
_"Traditional Drangleic Armour/Gauntlets/Leggings. Belonged to Captain Drummond._   
_Drummond's ancestors have served Drangleic for generations, principally as defenders of the great fort, but Captain Drummond is the last in this proud line."_

###  Set Location

  * Drangleic Set (without helm) is found past [Pursuer](/Pursuer)'s main arena in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Forest of Fallen Giants"): go a bit forward and drop into the hole, then follow the slope to find a corpse next to inner wall. Loot also includes [Drangleic Sword](/Drangleic+Sword "Drangleic Sword") and [Drangleic Shield](/Drangleic+Shield "Drangleic Shield").
  * Drangleic Helm is obtained from [Captain Drummond](/Captain+Drummond) in [Memory of Vammar](/Memory+of+Vammar): speak to him after defeating [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Giant Lord") in [Memory of Jeigh](/Memory+of+Jeigh "Memory of Jeigh") (with or without Drummond's aid or even without speaking to Drummond prior to the fight).

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite.](/Twinkling+Titanite)
