    | Location | Object Description | Effectiveness |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Belfry Luna | Stack of three barrels, laid horizontally | Low . Stacked barrels are easily spotted, and players tend to destroy them by rolling |
    | Belfry Luna | A thin brazier, unlit | High . A thin and short prop. Also colored black, making it very easy to blend into shadows |
    | Grave of Saints | Standing rat statue holding a jar | Medium-low . Best used in the hallways with other rat statues. |
    | Grave of Saints | Small rat statue in a quadrupedal position | Low . Found in only one area of the Grave of Saints, and seems out of place anywhere else |
    | Grave of Saints | Bone-filled brazier, unlit | High . Thinner and smaller than the player. Fits almost anywhere in the area |
    | Iron Keep | A moderately sized urn | Medium . This prop blends in well, but few urns exist in Iron Keep, and at a few locations |
    | Doors of Pharros | Rat / Gyrm statue | Medium . A large prop, but the Gyrm statue blends in well with the stone environment |
    | Undead Crypt | Unmarked headstone | High . A small prop, with numerous rooms full of them to hide amongst |
    | Undead Crypt | A cistern stained and bound in ropes | Medium . Hides well amongst similar props in the area |
    | Shrine of Amana | Cursed urn | Low . Few urns exist in the Amana Shrine, and players tend to roll through them out of habit |
    | Shrine of Amana | Broken Column | High . The decrepit nature of the Amana Shrine makes the broken column prop blend in very well |
    | Drangleic Castle | Tall urn | Low . Few urns exist in Drangleic Castle, and their large profile makes them easy to spot |
    | Drangleic Castle | Wall Mirror | Very low . Many exist in the castle, but this prop is large and visibly floats off walls |
    | Drangleic Castle | Small crate | High . Very small prop, hides easily behind pillars, enemies, and in corners |
