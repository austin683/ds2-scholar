**Acid Surge** is a [Pyromancy](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Acid Surge** , an unconventional pyromancy of mysterious origin. Unleashes a corrosive acid that erodes equipment. While it doesn't harm foes directly, it ruthlessly corrodes their gear. A testament to the cunning inspirations behind many pyromancies. To cast a Pyromancy, you must use a Flame or Special Weapons that can cast Pyromancy. This pyromancy works similarly to the [Corrosive Urn](/Corrosive+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Corrosive Urn").

> Does not directly damage foes, but eats away at their equipment instead. Yet another pyromancy inspired by perniciousness."

### Dark Souls 2 Acid Surge Acquired From

  * [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis") by trading in [Royal Rat Authority Soul](/Royal+Rat+Authority+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Authority Soul") and 1,500 souls.

### Acid Surge Notes & Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Deals 18 durability damage to armor and rings.
  * Applies a 5% [debuff](/Buffs+&+Debuffs "Dark Souls 2 Buffs & Debuffs") to enemy defenses when procced.
  * A spell that has a very practical use in PvP. Breaking an opponent's equipment can give you a significant advantage. For example, if Acid Surge manages to break an opponent's [First, Second, or Third Dragon Ring](/First+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 First Dragon Ring"), the opponent may be restricted to a slower roll.
  * You can identify when a ring breaks by the sound of glass breaking. When pieces of armor are broken, a wooden-like sound can be heard instead.
  * In PvP, remove your lock on your opponent and then cast the Acid Surge. Lock on again and if they back away, proceed to cast something ([Forbidden Sun](/Forbidden+Sun "Dark Souls 2 Forbidden Sun"), [Great Lightning Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear"), etc.) through the mist. Since it is difficult to see through, your opponent will have little time to evade which almost guarantees direct hits.
