**Small Shields** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are types of [Shields](/Shields "Dark Souls 2 Shields") that usually weighs very little and have the least form of protection from attacks. They are often used by players who prefer Parrying rather than Blocking. Small Shields have a longer parry animation compared to other Shields, which makes it easier for the player to parry an incoming attack from the opponent. Players cannot use their Weapon's Skill without first putting a Small Shield away or without two-handing their current equipped Weapon. This page covers a list of all Small Shields in Dark Souls 2.
