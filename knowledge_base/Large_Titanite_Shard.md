### Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard Usage:

### Large Titanite Shard Location in DKS2:

  * In a chest underneath the [Cardinal Tower bonfire](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower"). Go down to the room with all the ballistae (just before [Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate")) and go down the ladder. There is a door behind you that you cannot open. Hit the door and the hollows on the other side will open it. Kill them. Inside that room is a chest with a Large Titanite Shard. This is the earliest one you can find in the game.
  * In [No Man's Wharf](/No+Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No Man%27s Wharf") in a hidden room behind a destructible wall on the first floor of the house containing the poison jars and Estus Flask Shard. There is a chest, corpse loot, and lizard in the room. The Large Titanite Shard is dropped by the lizard.
  * Also in No Man's Wharf, behind an illusory wall in the neighboring house.
  * In the [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley") mines.
  * One drops from each of the three Crystal Lizards after the second bonfire in Harvest Valley.
  * In [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep").
  * Sold by McDuff the Blacksmith in the [Lost Bastille ](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille")for 2500 souls after acquiring the [Dull Ember](/Dull+Ember "Dark Souls 2 Dull Ember") (Unlimited Supply)
  * In a chest in McDuff's Workshop (x2)

  * From the [Tower Apart](/Tower+Apart "Dark Souls 2 Tower Apart") bonfire in the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille") go left and hug the wall until you come to a corpse. Shard is on the corpse.
  * Above Lucatiel of Mirrah on a small ledge in the Lost Bastille. (x1 at NG, and x5 at NG+ [Use ascetic at Mc Duff's workshop]) Accessed from the broken wall facing away from McDuff's workshop.
  * In [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"), at the edge of the cliff just before entering the spider caves that lead down to the cathedral.

  * The [Darksucker](/Darksucker "Dark Souls 2 Darksucker")s in the Black Gulch

### Large Titanite Shard Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2:

  * By killing the Great Basilisk in Huntsman's Copse. It always drops 3 LT shards (Best farm, farming possible very early in the game, can be done infinitely by joining Covenant of Champions).
  * Easy farming method: before beating [The Rotten](/The+Rotten "Dark Souls 2 The Rotten") (or using an [ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") to respawn him), summon [Lucatiel](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah") and [Schmidt](/Lone+Hunter+Schmidt "Dark Souls 2 Lone Hunter Schmidt"). Destroy all poison-spitting statues (they won't "respawn" as long as you don't die or leave the area). Use [firebomb](/Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Firebomb")s from a decent range and the [Darksucker](/Darksucker "Dark Souls 2 Darksucker")s won't aggro, but will take damage over time from the ignited tar pits. The phantom duo will do great damage. Send the phantoms home with the [Black Separation Crystal](/Black+Separation+Crystal "Dark Souls 2 Black Separation Crystal"), rest at the bonfire, and repeat. Once all 15 spawns have been exhausted, kill the [Cragslipper](/Cragslipper "Dark Souls 2 Cragslipper")s and work on 15 spawns of the Darksuckers closer to the beginning of the [Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch"). Repeat. You will mostly get large shards, but the Darksuckers also drop [chunk](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk")s, which is only a pleasant byproduct. (As with any farming, ensure that you've maxed out your item find as much as possible.)
