**Heide Knight Leggings** is a **legging** and a part of [Hard Leather Set](/Hard+Leather+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Heide Knight Leggings Description

"Leggings worn by Heide Knights"  
"Whether Heide refers to a kingdom or was just a name for the land is not clear, for no records date back far enough to tell.  
All that is known is that the Way of Blue has its origins in Heide, and that Heide was later subsumed by the sea."

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Heide Knight NG+(only) (or by Bonfire Ascetic)

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite Shards, Large Titanite Shards, Titanite Chunks, Titanite Slab](/Ores)
  * Best way to get the set is to kill the knight that is in Lost Bastille. (Exile Holding Cell bonfire. Short walk to the knight from the bonfire, with only one enemy in the way.) Using a greathammer will make this simple, as your heavy attack will stunlock the red phantom and the Heide Knight.
  * Assuming that you're attempting to get the entire set via bonfire ascetic, you will need more than one, as the armor does not drop all together, but only in pieces
  * Despite its name, the [Heide Knight Iron Mask](/Heide+Knight+Iron+Mask) does not belong to this set
  * The Greathelm is a decent item for dressing as Solaire of Astora from  _Dark Souls_ , although the helm is an entirely different design, and it doesn't have the red feather at the top.
