### How to get Full Moon Sickle in Dark Souls 2

  * Dropped by: [Undead Huntsman](/Undead+Huntsman "Dark Souls 2 Undead Huntsman") and [Crescent Sickle Phantom](/Crescent+Sickle+Phantom "Dark Souls 2 Crescent Sickle Phantom").

### DS2 Full Moon Sickle Hints and Tips

  * Extremely high bleed bulidup, with the cost of slow swinging.
  * Infuse with [Bleed Stone](/Bleed+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Bleed Stone") to make it more effective, it probably has the highest bleed buildup among all the weapons.
  * Power stance light attack is extremely slow since it is reaper-type weapon, and it often misses out small or humanoid targets.
  * Effective for inflicting bleed on large enemies with power stance heavy attack.
  * Cannot be coated in [Bleeding Serum](/Bleeding+Serum "Dark Souls 2 Bleeding Serum"), even before [Bleed Stone](/Bleed+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Bleed Stone") infusion.
  * Using [Shadow Gauntlets](/Shadow+Set "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Set") and [Crest of Blood](/Crest+of+Blood "Dark Souls 2 Crest of Blood") with dual Bleed Full Moon Sickle +10 will push the top notch bleed weapon to full power, it is possible to inflict bleeding **INSTANTLY** with the use of a single power stance strong attack.
  * In [Scholar Of The First Sin](/Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin"), consider [Scythe of the Forlorn](/Scythe+of+The+Forlorn "Dark Souls 2 Scythe of The Forlorn") as well, which has similar stats with slightly lower base damage, but higher DEX scaling and extra Dark damage, making it a possibly better option for hex or mundane builds. However, you have to be fully hollowed for it to even be considered a good substitute.
