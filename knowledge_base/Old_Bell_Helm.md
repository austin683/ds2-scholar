_"Helm forged from an ancient bell.__Appears to be a mere curiosity,_

_but it is in fact quite practical. The top of the helm provides significant defense."_

###  Location

  * Found in [Frozen Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Eleum Loyce"): just before dropping down to the second bonfire (Abandoned Dwelling), turn the opposite direction, pass a room with a [Hollow Prisoner](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner"), and mount an icy slope.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Upgraded stats are only 50% higher.
  * Negates headshot damage (and makes a bell ding sound when you receive a hit to the head).
  * Increases the damage of spells that are cast with chimes (~1%).
