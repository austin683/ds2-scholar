    | Faraam Set |
    

**Faraam Set**   
The armor worn by the Undead Knight which represents the player character, seen in trailers and various forms of media in regards to Dark Souls 2. It likely is going to be the iconic armor of the game just as the Fluted Armor was in Demon's Souls, and the Elite Knight Set in Dark Souls. The armor features fur and a coat which has its own physics and will authentically react to movement and the environmental conditions such as wind. It appears to have a chest plate though the legs are mostly unarmored. The helm is a barbute helm, the ridge on top of it also resembling old forms of rank among warriors. Due to its use in what gameplay has been seen and lack of leg armor it very well may be considered only medium armor. This armor currently is associated with the Warrior starting class, because of this it may actually be called Warrior Armor. At this time it is not known.   
The current description reads as:   
Helm / Armor / Gauntlets / Boots   
  
(Piece) blessed by the war god Faraam.   
  
These (piece) are in the style of the Lion Knights, a once-mighty order from Forossa.   
Although the Lion Knights wore heavy armor, they were feared for their nimble two-handed swordplay.

**White Mask Armor**   
As seen in the trailer there will be figures wearing White Masks that may work against the protagonist.
