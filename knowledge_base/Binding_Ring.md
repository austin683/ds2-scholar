**Ring of Binding** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **Ring of Binding** , a mysterious ring of uncertain origin, limits the reduction of the wearer's HP in a Hollow state, yet wearing it won't restore humanity—what's lost isn't easily reclaimed. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> An unusual ring of unknown origin. Limits the wearer's HP reduction when Hollow. Alas, this ring will not make you human. What is lost is not easily retrieved.

#### DS2 Ring of Binding Tips and Notes

  * If your health is being affected by this ring and you are summoned as a White Phantom to another player's world, then there is a way to become human when you return to your world. Simply remove the Ring of Binding and replace it with another ring since the game spawns you in human form when you're a white phantom. Regardless of whether or not you succeed, you should be in human form when you return to your world.(This happened to me recently, I'll have to check whether or not it wasn't just an isolated incident and whether or not it is indeed this item that is causing it)
  * _**Confirmed Bug:**_ most likely to be patched soon. (Source: [Dark Souls 2 Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/20ekpn/reviving_to_human_after_playing_coop_is_a_bug/))
  * **_Update:_** however, this bug has not a 100% chance to turn you into human form again. it's still completely random.
