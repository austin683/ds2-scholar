### Creighton the Wanderer Dialogue

**\- When met in Hunstman's Copse**

  1. Who are you?  
I thought you were that bastard for a moment.  
You've set me free. Now I can find him.  
The cheeky prick. He won't know what hit him.
  2. I am Creighton, of Mirrah. I travel from land to land to hone my blade.  
I've heard this land was full of danger. I thought it would suit me perfectly.  
I joined forces with a man on the way, but he was no more than a back-stabbing knave.  
He took the first chance he had to try and off me.  
I decided to set a trap for him here, but then I got trapped myself.  
I can't believe that I was so dense. Thank the stars that you came along.
  3. You be careful of him. Pate, I think he said.  
He wears this rather unusual ring. You know it when you see it.  
I've seen his type before. He kills entirely for the pleasure of it.  
I'm sure I won't be his last victim. The man's better off dead, I tell you.  
He's a slick talker, so don't let him fool you.
  4. Pate, the man with the strange ring. Watch out for the slimy rat.  
And don't you believe a word he says.  
I'll find the common footpad, and put an end to his roguery. Heh heh.

**\- When met in Shaded Woods**

  1. Heh heh…Just wait, you dirty rat…  
Hm? Oh…Oh! I-I remember you?!  
Don't you scare me like that. I thought you were him.
  2. That bastard with the ring lives in Brightstone Cove down the way.  
I'm gonna find him and settle the score. Nobody insults me like that.
  3. For the good of the world, and for my own honour.  
I won't let that bastard live another day. Heh heh…

**\- When encountered fighting Pate in Brighstone Cove Tseldora**  
Damn! You're tougher than you look!

**\- When talking after helping him kill Pate**

  1. …Serves you right…Hah hah hah!  
…Hah hah…Hah hah hah hah!
  2. …I did it…Hah hah!  
Thanks for your help. He was no pushover…  
Here, take this, and go to my bolt-hole down the way.  
What's there is yours.  
Just a small token of appreciation.
  3. You did me well.

**\- When talking after he kills Pate without player help**  
…Serves you right…Hah hah hah!  
…Wait… …You weren't friends with that rat, were you?  
Then jog on…You've no business with me.

**\- When talking to him in Brightstone Cove Tseldora after the player has killed Pate somewhere else**  
Oh, you. What do you want?  
That bastard's run off somewhere.

**\- When talking to him in Brightstone Cove Tseldora after the player has killed Pate somewhere else, if wearing the Ring of Thorns**  
Your ring! That's his ring!  
You're not friends with the bastard, are you?  
Hand that ring over to me. He's no friend of yours. You can do without it.  
Think carefully before you answer.

**\- Answer "yes"**  
You killed him, didn't you?  
Fair play. As long as he got what he deserved.  
Here, take this, and go to my bolt-hole down the way.  
What's there is yours.  
Just a small token of appreciation.

**\- Answer "no"**  
I see how it is. You're another slimy toad!

**\- Talking a second time after agreeing to give him the ring**  
You did me well.

**\- When the player opens the trapped chest in Brightstone Cove Tseldora**  
Ooh, that'll leave a nasty scar!

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
Here, these are for you.  
You did me well. Just take 'em.

**\- When attacked but not aggroed**  
Whoah!  
(or)  
Hey, watch it there!  
(or)  
Why, you!

**\- When attacked and aggroed**  
Do you want some? Fine enough!

**\- When killing the player**  
Next time, you think before you pick a fight!

**\- When re-encountered after aggroing**  
Don't you ever give up!

**\- When attacked and health is under 50%**  
Damn! This isn't right!

**\- When killed**  
(whimpering and sighing; no subtitles)

**\- Unknown**  
Heh…Rotten bastard…

### Dark Souls 2 Creighton the Wanderer Notes & Trivia

  * [Cale the Cartographer](/Cale+the+Cartographer "Dark Souls 2 Cale the Cartographer") claims that he saw a man that looked similar to a serial killer in Mirrah, and that his name was "Cray something".
  * His armour has the same family crest as [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo"), though they are probably not related as Benhart's armor's description states that he found it, making it unlikely that he is actually of the same family as Creighton, only that he may have journeyed to Mirrah for his armor set.
  * If you have killed Pate earlier you can still get the key by talking to Creighton in Brightstone Cove Tseldora at the cost of giving him Pate's ring.
  * He does not take the ring; he only wishes to assess whether you are Pate's friend. Just say you will give it to him and he will give you the key. NOTE: this must be the original Ring of Thorns. I accidentally sold mine after buying the Ring of Thorns +1 from Grave Warden Agdayne.
  * In the original Dark Souls 2 trailer it shows three Mirrah Knights identical to Creighton fight and lose to the Faraam knight.
  * Makes an appearance in Dark Souls 3 as an invader and as a part of a sidequest to help another NPC defeat him.
