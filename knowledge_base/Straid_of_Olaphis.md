  * Teaches you the [gesture](/Gestures "Dark Souls 2 Gestures") Mock.
  * Talk to him after trading 4 boss souls and he will give you the [Black Robe Set](/Black+Robe+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Robe Set").
  * If Straid is killed, either by the mummies or by the player, he can be respawned at a cost of 14,000 souls. It'll take several visits for the gravestone to appear.

### Straid of Olaphis Dialogue

**\- When first met**  
Still a bit stiff, I'm afraid. Heh heh heh…  
I must thank you, young traveller.  
I am Straid. A wandering sorcerer of sorts.  
I've been a guest for a very long time. But I don't think that anybody will miss me!

**\- When the player has insufficient INT**  
Cursed one, you lack intelligence.  
Weak, so terribly weak…  
Heh heh heh…

**\- When the player has sufficient INT and FTH**  
Hm-hmm…  
Very good, very good indeed.  
Cursed one, weak you may be, but I, Straid, will teach you my spells.

**\- When talking to open interaction menu, without a boss soul**  
Souls! I need souls! You cursed fool!  
If you seek my strength, bring me souls!  
Bigger, stronger souls! Heh heh…

**\- When talking to open interaction menu, with a boss soul**  
Well! This is a most peculiar soul.  
Very good, very good indeed.  
Unusual souls produce unusual spells. Heh heh heh…  
(or)  
Well! This is a most charming soul.  
Very good, very good indeed.  
My power is yours! Let it serve your desires! Heh heh heh…  
(or)  
Well! This is a most twisted soul.  
Very good, very good indeed.  
Prepare to peer straight into the heart of magic. Heh heh heh…

**\- When leaving, having used his services**  
Feeble cursed one!  
Do you really think you can manage the glories that are my spells?

**\- When leaving, without having used his services**  
Feeble cursed one!  
Let's hope the magnificence of my spells does not deter you! Heh heh!

**\- When walking off without closing the menu**  
Don't just walk off, cursed one. Heh heh…

**\- Using 'Talk' option**

  1. So, how long was I sat petrified…  
Long enough for the old kingdom to have crumbled, I see.  
Long enough for Olaphis to rise, fall, and fade away, evidently.  
Why didn't anyone wake me sooner?! Heh heh…
  2. Drangleic… I've never heard the name.  
Is that what they call this place now?  
Hah hah…Very good, very good indeed.
  3. The cursed ones were imprisoned within this land.  
Of course, you came of your own free will. Heh heh…  
The people feared the cursed ones like a plague.  
Some people would rather keep dreadful things out of sight, out of mind.  
In the end they swept them up and corralled them here.  
So very typical of meek minds, don't you think?
  4. Once people became aware of their own frailty…  
They seized anybody they found undesirable, cursed or no, and impounded them here.  
Whoever posed even the slightest threat, was removed. All so that they could sleep better at night.  
They even turned the great Straid into a stone! Hah hah!
  5. Many kingdoms rose and fell on this tract of earth; mine was by no means the first.  
Anything that has a beginning also has an end. No flame, however brilliant, does not one day splutter and fade.  
But then, from the ashes, the flame reignites, and a new kingdom is born, sporting a new face.  
It is all a curse! Heh heh heh!  
And it is your cursed flesh that will inherit the flame. Heh heh…
  6. Pyromancy was created by the ancient witch of fire.  
She harnessed the power of flame, and melded it into pyromancy.  
The witch led her daughters into war against the Old Ones.  
But legends are legends.  
What are you prepared to believe? Heh heh…

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
Cursed one, take these.  
Put them on, and please, stop being so weak. Heh heh…

**\- When attacked but not aggroed**  
Heh heh heh…  
(or)  
How testy, little cursed one!  
(or)  
You dare challenge me? Heh heh…

**\- When attacked and aggroed**  
Weak, so terribly weak…

**\- When killing the player**  
Hah hah hah hah!

**\- When re-encountered after aggroing**  
Come back for more, little cursed one? Heh heh…

**\- When attacked and health is under 50%**  
Ooh, you're tough, cursed one! Heh heh…

**\- When killed**  
Very good, very good indeed.

**\- When the player has insufficient FTH** (can't be heard in-game, due to every starting class having at least 4 FTH)  
Cursed one, you lack faith.  
You are weak, very weak…  
Heh heh heh…

**\- When the player has both insufficient INT and FTH** (again, can't be heard in-game)  
I sense the curse within you.  
It has made you terribly frail.  
Your faith and intelligence are anaemic. Life must be unbearable. Heh heh...

**\- Unused dialogue**  
Our king, Alvis, feared the cursed ones like the plague.
