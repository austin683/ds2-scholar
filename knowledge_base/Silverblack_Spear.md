**Silverblack Spear** is a [weapon](/Weapons "weapon") in **Dark Souls 2**.

> _A silver-black spear imbued with the power of dark.  
> _   
>  _The grave wardens vowed to ensure the tranquility of those who slumber in the Undead Crypt._   
>   
>  _If one dares disturb them, the grave wardens make no allowance for stature or riches, and will readily bury them along with the others._

###  **Acquired From**

  * Dropped by Spear-Wielding [Grave Wardens](/Grave+Warden) in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak) as well as the grave wardens in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt).

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * When wielding with one hand the initial heavy strike is a horizontal attack, if you miss with this attack there is a large window for enemies to strike before you can recover, or follow up with the one-handed heavy lunge attack that comes after the horizontal strike, after the lunge attack, you can also backstep to cancel the staggering.
  * Since it by default inflicts Dark damage, you may infuse it with Darknight Stone to have it be Dark dedicated on scaling, as well as the increased Dark Damage.
