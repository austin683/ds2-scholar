### Dark Souls 2 Rampart Hedgehog Strategy Tips

  * It's recommended to use a long weapon with high damage that does slash or thrust attacks like halberds, Scythe, spears, ect., or use arrow(s) from afar/high grounds. When too close, their spikes will damage you.  
They are always found in packs and with their speed they can easily overwhelm you with numbers. Just as with any enemy, be careful about them surrounding you.
  * Avoid their spinning attacks, block (with a good shield) or dodge these attacks or take the advantage from high grounds. Combustion or anything similar can interrupt their attacks if they get too close .
