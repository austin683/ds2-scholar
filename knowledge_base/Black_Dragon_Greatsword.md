  * This sword has no scaling of any kind, but it will receive a "D" scaling in INT if infused with the Enchanted upgrade path.
  * Even with 30 on all stats for a Mundane infusion, the AR of the weapon would be still only 370.
  * While the [Raw](/Raw+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Raw Stone") infusion has 391, and they do received additional bonus with [Ring of Blades](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades").

### DS2 Black Dragon Greatsword Trivia

  * Description may be a reference to [Black Dragon Kalameet](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Dragon+Kalameet "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Kalameet") and the Obsidian Greatsword from _Dark Souls_ , or a further extent, Guyra from _King's Field_ which is obtained by cutting off his tail. Additionally, Just like [Black Dragon Sword](/Black+Dragon+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Sword"), the shape of this sword loosely resembles Quelaag's Furysword from _Dark Souls_ , try [Flame Weapon](/Flame+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Flame Weapon") for burning effect, it'll completely look like an enlarged Quelaag's Furysword.
