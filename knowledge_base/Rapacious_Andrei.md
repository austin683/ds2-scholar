**Rapacious Andrei** is an [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki").

_Rapacious Andrei Information:_

  * Andrei is only summonable in one place: At the start of the [Cave of the Dead](/Cave+of+the+Dead "Dark Souls 2 Cave of the Dead"), near the summoning circle. You can also summon [Ruined Aflis](/Ruined+Alfis "Dark Souls 2 Ruined Alfis"), for a total of 2 NPC Phantoms.
  * He wears the full [Travelling Merchant set](/Traveling+Merchant+Set "Dark Souls 2 Traveling Merchant Set"), similar to [Magerold of Lanafir](/Magerold+of+Lanafir "Dark Souls 2 Magerold of Lanafir"). Unlike Magerold, who uses a Scythe and a shield, Andrei uses a [Shotel](/Shotel "Dark Souls 2 Shotel"), which he can either 2-hand or 1-hand.
  * Similar to the [Explorer Starting Class](/Explorer "Dark Souls 2 Explorer"), who has a plethora of items, Andrei has quite the selection of consumables. He is one of the phantoms who can drink [Estus](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask"), can use [Gold Pine Resin](/Gold+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Gold Pine Resin") to buff his Shotel, and can even chuck [Witching Urns](/Witching+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Witching Urn"), [Firebombs](/Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Firebomb") (not Black, just normal) and [Throwing Knives](/Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Throwing Knife"). He does not however, use any bows, crossbows, greatbows or shields.
  * '_Rapacious_ ' means "**Having a strong wish to take things for yourself, usually using unfair methods or force** " (Cambridge Dictionary). This could signify that like the [gankfest-trio](/Graverobber,+Varg,+and+Cerah "Dark Souls 2 Graverobber, Varg, and Cerah"), Andrei himself is a Graverobber, intending to sack and loot the ancient city, only helping you in an attempt to rid himself of competition. This is unconfirmed, but it's a fun fan theory.

_Encounters:_

  * [Cave of the Dead](/Cave+of+the+Dead "Dark Souls 2 Cave of the Dead"), near the summoning circle.
