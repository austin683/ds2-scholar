**Bluemoon Greatsword** is a **[Greatsword](/Greatswords "Dark Souls 2 Greatswords")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. The **Bluemoon Greatsword** is a greatsword with a moon-like appearance. It is obtained by inheriting it from Benhart of Jugo after summoning him three times and defeating bosses with him surviving, or by killing him at the cost of gaining sin. Upgrading the sword with regular Titanite to +10 gives it the Mastodon Greatsword moveset. The intelligence bonus is only granted in the enchanted upgrade path, but choosing the Raw path often yields more damage for buffs

> The Blade of this greatsword shines like the brilliant rays of the moon. In the oldest legends, rarely spoken of today, it is said that the sword was born of a great white being.

> Then, what explains this lifeless weapon? Perhaps there has been some mistake... 

### How to get Bluemoon Greatsword in Dark Souls 2

  * Inherited from [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo"). Player must summon him three times and defeat the boss with him surviving the fight, then speak to him in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") or the [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Orro") to receive his equipment.
  * The player may instead kill him for the blade, but will gain sin when doing so.

### DS2 Bluemoon Greatsword Hints & Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * If you inherit his equipment instead of killing him for it, you gain an achievement/trophy.
  * Uses [Mastodon Greatsword](/Mastodon+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Mastodon Greatsword") moveset.
  * Gains a D (C on +10) bonus in int for the enchanted upgrade path, but not for any other path.
  * Despite this, going with the Raw upgrade path will yield more damage as buffs mostly consider AR before scaling for the buff formula.
  * Benhart believes the sword [contains power that only a true swordsman can unlock](/Moonlight+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Moonlight Greatsword"). Unfortunately, the blade is a fake. [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") will confirm this if you take the blade to him. (If Maughlin is in his final stage, where he yells "I'm rich, I'm rich!", he will not say anything about the sword).
  * Quite useful when infused with Raw or Enchanted.
  * Despite it being a "fake", the thick blade bears a closer resemblance to the Moonlight Greatsword from both Demon's Souls and Dark Souls.
