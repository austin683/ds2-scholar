**Greatbows** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a type of ranged [Weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") that's similar to [Bows](/Bows "Dark Souls 2 Bows"), but are heavier and have higher stat requirements. They have a slower rate of fire compared to bows but Greatbows have higher damage output. Some shots are also capable of knocking down enemies when landed. Unlike Bows and [Crossbows](/Crossbows "Dark Souls 2 Crossbows"), they cannot be fired while moving, players would need to remain stationary when firing shots with Greatbows. All Greatbows have better range than Bows, as players can zoom in to their sights and take a closer look at their aim when targeting. This page covers a list of all Greatbows in Dark Souls 2. Great arrows fired are not effected by [Flynn's Ring](/Flynn's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flynn's Ring").
