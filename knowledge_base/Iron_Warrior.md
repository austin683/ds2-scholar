### DKS2 Iron Warrior Strategy Tips

  * Try to keep behind them and move over to the side that just shot out lava (After it disappears) and repeat after the other side does the same.
  * If fighting them in the lower [Foyer](/Foyer "Dark Souls 2 Foyer") in the ashen area, the flame jets nearby serve as a great way to kill them, providing you have destroyed all of the powder barrels and hollows.
  * About half of the encounters with this enemy occur near environmental hazards or **Barrel-Carriers**. These can be used to the player's advantage, and this seems to be the intended method of defeating them in several encounters. 
  * Causing a **Barrel-Carrier** to explode near this enemy results in a one-hit kill (needs confirmation).
