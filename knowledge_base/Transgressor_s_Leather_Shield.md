**Transgressor's Leather Shield** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A shield enwreathed in a matte blackness.  
Found in the heart of the Dark Chasm._

     _No one knows what lies beyond the dark passages found across Drangleic,  
but perhaps they are better left undisturbed."_

### Acquired From:

  * Pre-order bonus for the Black Armor and Collector's Editions.
  * Sold by [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") for 8,000 souls after defeating the [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Knight").

### Transgressor's Leather Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Appears to be a modified [Small Leather Shield](/Small+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Small Leather Shield").
  * It is offered along with the [Transgressor's Staff](/Transgressor's+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Transgressor's Staff").
  * One of the heavier small shields, weighing 3 units.
  * Infusing the shield with Darknight Stone turns its Dark damage reduction to 100%, which is especially useful against [Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes") or Dark enchantments.
  * In an earlier version of the game, this shield erroneously weighed 0.3 units, making it the lightest small shield at the time.
