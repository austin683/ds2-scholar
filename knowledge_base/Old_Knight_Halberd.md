**Old Knight Halberd** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**

> _"An undated halberd._  
> _Wielded by a warrior from a time so ancient that there exists no record of his endeavors. Has extremely low durability. Sometimes, just as a thing falls to pieces, it unleashes its last flash of great power..."_

### **Acquired From**

  * Treasure pickup on the aqueduct that connects [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame") to [No-Man's Warf](/No-man's+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man's Wharf"). Run until you meet the first [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") and, after defeating it, continue straight ahead instead of down the stairs and find the item on a hidden corner.

### **Hints and Tips:**

-This weapon may seem very viable for dex builds, but notice it's incredibly low durability.
