### Astrologist Information in Dark Souls 2

Enemies wearing [Black Hollow Mage Hood](/Black+Hollow+Mage+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Hollow Mage Set") and [Astrologist's Set](/Astrologist%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Astrologist%27s Set"), carry [Cleric's Parma](/Cleric%27s+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Cleric%27s Parma"). They tend to hinder the Chosen Undead with [Profound Still](/Profound+Still "Dark Souls 2 Profound Still") or [Promised Walk of Peace](/Promised+Walk+of+Peace "Dark Souls 2 Promised Walk of Peace"), if they're getting too close, they'll cast [Blinding Bolt](/Blinding+Bolt "Dark Souls 2 Blinding Bolt") and [Sunlight Spear](/Sunlight+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Spear") at close range.   
  
In theory, they're believed to be the Drangleic Mages located at [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse") before hollowing (Black Hollow Mages served Old Iron King while White Hollow Mage served either Duke Tseldora or Lord Aldia), however this is not the case, since [Black Hollow Mages](/Hollow+Mage+%28Black%29 "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Mage %28Black%29") are tended to be female, while the Astrologists are actually male characters.
