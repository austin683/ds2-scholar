**Aldia Key** is a Key Item in **Dark Souls 2**.

###  Usage

  * Opens door on the right in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep") Main Corridor. This allows you to circle behind the second Cyclops and kill from behind.

###  Location

  * **Location for Scholar of the First Sin Edition**
    * The key is dropped by the bone dragon at the entrance to [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep"). You need to ignite the four braziers in the area, which will spawn four invaders. After that, returning to the entrance will trigger the dragon's animation.

    * Third floor of the entrance hall (where the dragon skeleton lies), turn right in front of the basilisk in the cage.
    * First floor of the entrance hall, right behind the head of the dragon skeleton.
