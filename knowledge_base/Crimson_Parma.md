**Crimson Parma** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

  

     _"A standard wooden parma._

     _The fancy name and nifty paint are surely a merchant's efforts  
to make this very ordinary shield more attractive."_

### Acquired From:

  * A chest in the tunnel leading towards [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame").

### Crimson Parma Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Handy for [classes](/Starting+Classes "Dark Souls 2 Starting Classes") that don't start with shields, seeing as it's free and easily obtainable.
  * This shield reappears in the sequel _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Crimson Parma](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Crimson+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Parma").
