**Cursed Bone Shield** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Small shield used by Aldian warlocks. Reinforced by a covert ritual that granted the shield the power of flame.  
Can deflect spells by parrying._

     _The peculiar figure known as Lord Aldia kept Giants in his manor, and attempted to recreate a dragon,  
but after some time, was not heard from again."_

### Acquired From:

  * Drops from [Aldia Warlock](/Aldia+Warlock "Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock") found beyond the Hollow Door in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana"). Above the [Rise of the Dead](/Rise+of+the+Dead "Dark Souls 2 Rise of the Dead") bonfire, near the Flame of Nito.
  * Drops from [Merciless Roenna](/Merciless+Roenna "Dark Souls 2 Merciless Roenna") in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman's+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman's Copse").
  * Scholar of The First Sin has moved the Aldia Warlock to [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia's+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia's Keep"). You can farm for this shield there. (Covenant of Champions is recommended as this is usually very rare and you won't want the warlock to despawn).

### Cursed Bone Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Can Deflect spells, the spell parry window is much larger than the normal parry window so is much easier to deflect spells with this shield than melee attacks. (spell parry is confirmed via spell parry animations.)
  * This shields defensive stats are all around very decent, but it does allow minor chip damage. As long as you're not turtling it is the perfect shield for light weight builds that need good defense and a good parry animation for pvp.
