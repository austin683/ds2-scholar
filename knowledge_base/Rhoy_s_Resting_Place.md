#  Rhoy's Resting Place

* * *

##  Bonfire Location:

Located in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana).   
The bonfire will be found behind a fog wall just past a group of Archdrake Priests and Priestesses. Recommended tactics are to attack the priestesses at a range with a bow in order to avoid dealing with their attacks when fighting the Priests. There are two areas where you can do this; one is a runway that points to the fog door (does not actually go there) and a small isle with a Priestess on it. After eliminating the priestesses you can proceed to fight the two Priests (note an additional two priests and an Archdrake Maiden will be found on NG+) just watch out for lizard men while fighting the Priests! 

##  Bosses:

  * [Demon of Song](/Demon+of+Song)

##  Special Notes:

After exiting Rhoy's Resting place players will be invaded by the NPC Phantom Peculiar Kindalur. Kindalur is agile and capable of performing Hexes, Sorceries, and even pyromancy in a tight spot. He may not be very dangerous by himself but the area near him is filled with hidden lizard men and covered by 3 amana priestess'. When Invading in the area this area is a good place to plan an ambush as you can use the confusion of Kindalur when planning your ambush.
