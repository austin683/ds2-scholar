**Hammers** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a type of [Weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") that mostly deal Strike damage, they also share similar attack animations to [Axes](/Axes "Dark Souls 2 Axes") and [Great Axes](/Great+Axes "Dark Souls 2 Great Axes"). Hammers tend to deal high damage to armored opponents, they are designed to be used for a single hit damage rather than in quick succession of attacks, since each swing of this weapon type is slow, but once the opponent is hit, they will most likely stagger. Hammers are very effective against turtling or defensive opponents. By landing a hit with a Hammer, the following attacks will become relatively faster, but when whiffed, it can be dangerous, leaving the player wide open for a punish. When using Hammers, the first strike is the most important hit, if it connects, it is almost always possible to follow up with another strike and potentially stagger the opponent. This page covers a list of all Hammers in Dark Souls 2.
