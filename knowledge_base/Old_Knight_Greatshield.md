**Old Knight Greatshield** is a [Greatshield](/Greatshields "Dark Souls 2 Greatshields") in Dark Souls 2. **Greatshields** can be used not only to block an enemy but allows player to do **shield bash**(Great shields replaced parry ability with heavy shield bash).

     _"An undated ancient greatshield_

     _Wielded by a warrior from a time so ancient that there exists no record of his endeavors. Has extremely low durability._

     _Sometimes, just as a thing falls to pieces, it unleashes its last flash of great power..."_

### Acquired From:

  * Obtained from [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley") behind a wooden wall which must be crushed by a large enemy such as the [Mounted Overseer](/Mounted+Overseer "Dark Souls 2 Mounted Overseer").

### Old Knight Greatshield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Tower shield+10 requires 2 more points of investment into strength and is, in most cases a better shield. (decide for yourself if 5 stability and slightly better element defense is worth the huge status effect/dark defense this has)
  * This shield, if infused with Bleed or Poison, will give you 100% resistance to them. Use the Poison resistance at The Gutter, Harvest Valley and Earthen Peak, and the Bleed one at Iron Keep and Huntsman Copse.
