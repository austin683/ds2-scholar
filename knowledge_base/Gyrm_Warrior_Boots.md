**Gyrm Warrior Boots** is a **legging** and a part of [Gyrm Warrior Set](/Gyrm+Warrior+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Gyrm Warrior Boots Description

_"Warrior leggings of the nomadic Gyrm. Excellent poise and defense, but very heavy.  
Most Gyrm descendants refuse contact with outsiders, and live with a sense of deep contempt for those who exiled them"_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Dropped by Gyrm warriors in [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros).
  * There is also the [Gyrm Warrior Greathelm](/Gyrm+Warrior+Greathelm) which is a rare drop from Gyrm Warriors, and it only drops from those wearing the Greathelm except [Gavlan](/Gavlan); it has the best physical defense stats for a helmet in the game when fully upgraded.

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Ores), this makes Gyrm Warrior Greatheim & Armor with Mastodon Gloves + Boots a much more considerable choice than [Havel's Set](/Havel%27s+Set), until you managed to collect 60 Twinkling Titanite.
  * extremely high physical defense, it outclassed [Ironclad Set](/Ironclad+Set) for the physical defense stat and lighter than it, this armor is, however, vulnerable to backstabbing.
  * While [Gyrm Warrior Set](/Gyrm+Warrior+Set) has the highest physical defense for headpiece (greathelm) and armor, [Mastodon Set](/Mastodon+Set) has the highest physical defense for gloves and boot, among all armors under normal titanite upgrading path.
