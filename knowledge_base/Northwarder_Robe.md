_"Robe of a Forossan sage._  
_Forossans venerated the god of war, and sages who led warriors into battle were called Northwarders._  
_Northwarders earned their title only after completing a great journey of great hardship,  
after which they would be worshipped as oracles of the war gods"_

### Location

  * [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King") DLC Armor. Found in [Frozen Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Eleum Loyce"): enter a side room past the first bunch of [Rampart Soldiers](/Rampart+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Rampart Soldier"), go up the ladder, pick up loot from the corpse. The entrance to that side room is blocked by a platform filled with coffins; to move it, travel forth from the Abandoned Dwelling bonfire, reach the bridge, turn left and find a small room with a lever just before the exit to another open area.

### Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Upgraded stats are only 50% higher and physical defenses are only 25% higher.
  * Robe offers second highest poison resistance (almost equal to that of [Grave Warden](/Grave+Warden+Set "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Set") and [Tattered Cloth](/Tattered+Cloth+Set "Dark Souls 2 Tattered Cloth Set") robes).
  * Per data in this thread, each piece of this set increases duration of most spells as follows: 
    * hood: +5% spell duration;
    * robe: +2.5% spell duration;
    * manchettes: +12.5% spell duration;
    * trousers: +2.5% spell duration.
  * [Sacred Oath](/Sacred+Oath "Dark Souls 2 Sacred Oath"), resins, and Throne Watcher and Defender weapon buffs are not extended in duration when this set is worn.
  * The set is almost identical to that worn by _Sage Freke_ from _Demon's Souls_. It also loosely resembles Sage set worn by _Big Hat Logan_ from _Dark Souls_ , except not having the big hat and trousers.
