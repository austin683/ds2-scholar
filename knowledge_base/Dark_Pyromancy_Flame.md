It can be found in [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"), near the first dog, sitting on a ledge amidst some jars. To wield its power effectively, one must understand that it scales with both Intelligence and Faith, but

> A flame catalyst used by pyromancers. Pyromancers rouse this flame to produce various fire arts. The flame rewards those with a thirst of power. The more Hollowed one is, the stronger its effect. Effect: Spell power scales with Hollowing. 

### How to get Dark Pyromancy Flame in Dark Souls 2

  * [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter") just before the first dog on a ledge in some jars.

### DS2 Dark Pyromancy Hints and Tips

  * Fire damage scales with Int and Faith. Softcap is Int + Faith = 60.
  * Fire damage also scales with [hollowing](/Hollowing "Dark Souls 2 Hollowing"), effectively getting max damage at full hollow. Testing shows that at max hollowing (10 deaths, half HP), the Dark Pyromancy Flame only outperforms the regular Pyromancy Flame by 3-4% in damage. At all other levels of hollowing, the regular Pyromancy Flame outperforms the Dark variant.
  * As of [Calibration 10](/Patches "Dark Souls 2 Patches"), the [Red Tearstone Ring](/Red+Tearstone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Red Tearstone Ring") no longer boosts its damage.
  * You cannot invade using the [Red Sign Soapstone](/Red+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 Red Sign Soapstone"), the [Cracked Red](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb") or [Blue Orbs](/Cracked+Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Blue Eye Orb") or see summon signs of any kind while hollowed, reducing the number of player interactions you can engage in while using weapons that benefit from hollowing.
  * The formula to define the Bonus AR is:  
  
Fire Bonus AR: normal Bonus AR - hollowing additive  
normal Bonus AR = Fire BNS * 1.1 (this flame has 110% fire scaling)  
hollowing additive = (10 - hollowing level) * (27.16 + (0.098 * Fire BNS))  
The final result is rounded down  
  
Fire Clutch ring gains buff quantity gaining hollowing, starting from +3 up to +30. Average improving is 2.7 for each hollowing level.  
  
Hollowing level is a hidden stat but the player can keep track of that: basically it's 0 when the player is human and every time the Curse (or death) reduces Max HP the hollowing level goes up by 1. Max hollowing level (50% of Max total HP) is 10 although through observation and tests it appears that being hit by petrification can bring that value above 10; that is just for trivia though, the max influence of hollowing is at 10, after that no more variations are applied.
