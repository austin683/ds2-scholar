**Archdrake Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Shield of the Archdrake sect of Lindelt.  
The dragon was engraved for ritual purposes, but the shield itself is highly functional._

     _The secrets of Lindelt rituals are protected by the Archdrake sect, and only a select few are given access to their canon of knowledge, which includes the truthful origins of the Archdrake sect itself."_

### Acquired From:

  * Located in a chest behind a boarded up wall closest to the Exile Holding Cells bonfire in [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille") head left from the bonfire and head up the stairs and down the rampart. Go down the ladder to your left and go through the door way and head right. There will be a boarded up door. Break the boards and head through and to you left. You will see a door. Use the [Antiquated Key](/Antiquated+Key "Dark Souls 2 Antiquated Key") to open it and head straight and through the doorway, climb up the ladder to your left and drop down onto the raised platform. Detonate the exploding barrels on the platform to open a secret passage way. It is on a corpse there.

### Archdrake Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Early shield for both physical and magic defense, leave it uninfused for the best result.
