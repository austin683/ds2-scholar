## Harvest Valley

This area contains many powerful casters and poison pools which are dangerous to explore in without the appropriate gear, it is best to take one's time and proceed slowly to avoid a surprise attack which leads to death by poison. The [Heirs of the Sun](/Heirs+of+the+Sun "Dark Souls 2 Heirs of the Sun") covenant can also be found in this area.

### Harvest Valley Walkthrough

### Stone Trader

From the [Skeleton Lords](/Skeleton+Lords "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton Lords") boss area in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse"), head through the doorway in that room and continue on a path leading to a raised bridge. Pull the lever on the right to lower the bridge and cross over into **Harvest Valley**. As you move along the rocky pathways you will soon encounter a pool of poison to your right blocking a cave which harbors the first **Bonfire**. Defeating the boss in Earthen Peak will drain the pool is drained. However, as that comes later, cross quickly but don't roll as that covers your entire body in poison rather than only your legs. Once you've used the bonfire, head back across the poison pool, and up the right side the hill to encounter the NPC [ Stone Trader Chloanne ](/Stone+Trader+Chloanne "Dark Souls 2 Stone Trader Chloanne"). Exhaust her dialogue to move her to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula").

### Misty Treasures

Peering over the edge, you can spot a rather large enemy standing in the middle of a poison lake, a [Banedigger](/Banedigger "Dark Souls 2 Banedigger"); this guy uses Dark Orbs. Use this vantage point to defeat him with ranged attacks, as battling in the poison mist is too unnecessarily risky. After dispatching him, head down the path to your left and continue to walk along the ledge to find a spawning [Skeleton](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") and a corpse holding a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). In the poison mist you can see a plethora of items scattered all over the area. There are also 3 [Hollow Crawler](/Hollow+Crawler "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Crawler") and a few more [Skeletons](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") that spawn when traversing this area. Tank up on anti-poison items of your choice and plunder:

  * 7x [Fading Soul ](/Fading+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Fading Soul")
  * 7x [ Titanite Shard ](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard")
  * 10x [Poison Throwing Knife ](/Poison+Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Poison Throwing Knife")
  * 2x [Small Smooth & Silky Stone ](/Small+Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth %26 Silky Stone")
  * 2x [Titanite Chunk ](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk")
  * 2x [Torches](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch")
  * 1x [Bleed Stone](/Bleed+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Bleed Stone")
  * 1x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem")

Head through the small archway in the middle of the lakes wall and kill the skeleton to your right. Circle around the left of the poison pit to loot a corpse holding a [ Fragrant Branch Of Yore ](/Fragrant+Branch+Of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch Of Yore") and a [ Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). Continue along the ledge and enter the hole in the wall to find the NPC [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan") (If you talked to him previously in [No-man's Wharf](/No-man's+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man's Wharf")). Behind him is a chest containing [Raw Stone](/Raw+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Raw Stone"). Exiting this room, in this same cave, down in the mist, there should be a small alcove to the left of the slope leading down. In here you'll find a chest containing a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed") and a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing").

Leave this cave, back out to the open and head up the slope to where you found the single [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). Continue along and you'll arrive to the greetings of two [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress "Dark Souls 2 Desert Sorceress"); one on a ledge on the left, and another on a higher platform at the back. They're easily dispatched at range by rolling the occasional fire hail. Melee is also viable, but be wary, as they also cast [Lingering Flame](/Lingering+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Lingering Flame"), which will explode instantly if you're in melee range. Climb the ladder that you first come across on the right for a better vantage point and 10x [Hexing Urns](/Hexing+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Hexing Urn"). You will also find multiple [Undead](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") around the area. Climb the second ladder on the right to arrive at where the second [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress "Dark Souls 2 Desert Sorceress") is/was. You'll find a lever you can pull to raise the wooden gate blocking the exit. Head through and turn right to reach the second **Bonfire.** Be careful with the urns in this area, as they are all filled with poison.

### From the Second Bonfire

Past this bonfire, you'll come upon a small quarry with several holes filled with poisonous gas. Here you'll find three [Crystal Lizards](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard"). This is quite convenient, as if you miss any of them, you can easily go back to the bonfire, rest, and try again, without traveling a long distance or having to face any enemies in the process. Along the left wall is a path leading up to a boarded off area, and an opening on the right, ignore the opening for now.

As you approach the wall a [Banedigger](/Banedigger "Dark Souls 2 Banedigger") will burst through. Instead of killing him, get around him and bait him into destroying another wall (NG+ there is a Sickle Wielding Giant Phantom hiding behind it). With the wall gone and the giant dead claim the treasure:

  * 1x [Old Knight Pike](/Old+Knight+Pike "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight Pike")
  * 1x [Old Knight Greatshield](/Old+Knight+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight Greatshield")
  * 1x [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead")
  * 1x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch")
  * 1x [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem")
  * x1 [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth %26 Silky Stone")

Near where the Giant was is a small ledge you can drop off, onto a chest containing a [Poison Stone](/Poison+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Poison Stone") and 3x [Rotten Pine Resin](/Rotten+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Rotten Pine Resin"). The only way out is down into a gas filled tunnel with a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and a Skeleton. At the end of the tunnel is a ladder leading back to the small quarry. From here, return to the path with the [Banedigger](/Banedigger "Dark Souls 2 Banedigger") and enter the opening we ignored earlier.

### Boxed In

Once you're through there, 4 [Undead Huntsmen](/Undead+Huntsman "Dark Souls 2 Undead Huntsman") will converge from the sides, and a small wall raises behind you, blocking a potential escape the same way you entered. You can kite them and use the raised pathways as a bottle neck. You can also escape the area by going up the ramp, to the right, then breaking through the third set of boards. This is actually **the easiest way** , because than you can pick them one by one with a halberd, by sniping, and/or spells. Once all the enemies are cleared out, break the rest of the boards and claim the remaining loot of the area which includes:

  * 1x [Simpleton's Spice](/Simpleton%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton%27s Spice")
  * 1x [Skeptic's Spice](/Skeptic%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic%27s Spice")
  * 1x [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem")
  * 5x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem")
  * 1x [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard")
  * 1x [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard")
  * 1x [Large Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Large+Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Brave Warrior")
  * 3x [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom")

One of the boards hides 2[ Hollows](/Abandoned+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Abandoned Hollow"). Another board hides a tunnel that has two exits: one lead you to a [Petrified Something](/Petrified+Something "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Something") on a ledge overlooking a small quarry, and the other brings you to a [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard") then a pit which jumping into will lead to death. So take the lizard then head the other way.

### Misty Path to the Sun

It is time to enter one of the aforementioned, poison holes. Look for the one with a lootable body at the bottom and hop in. Grab the [Fading Soul](/Fading+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Fading Soul") from it and run down the tunnel. Near the exit is another [Simpleton's Spice](/Simpleton%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton%27s Spice"). The tunnel leads to another gas filled pit with two more [Banediggers](/Banedigger "Dark Souls 2 Banedigger"). Run up the nearby ramp for a breather, and dispatch of them with ranged attacks, if you desire. Be careful though, as a [Forlorn](/Forlorn "Dark Souls 2 Forlorn") can invade here, and there will also be a [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress "Dark Souls 2 Desert Sorceress") high above periodically raining down fireballs. Scattered across the floor of the pit, are several lootable bodies. Be careful when looting down there though, as there are [Hollow Crawler](/Hollow+Crawler "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Crawler") and Skeletons waiting down there as well.

  * 1x [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard")
  * 3x [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard")
  * x1 [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab")
  * x1 [Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Brave Warrior")
  * x1 [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy")
  * x1 [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth & Silky Stone")
  * [Chameleon](/Chameleon "Dark Souls 2 Chameleon") Sorcery
  * [Dragon Charm](/Dragon+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Charm")
  * [Washing Pole](/Washing+Pole "Dark Souls 2 Washing Pole")

Once back up the ramp, you can either go right to go back to the quarry near the second bonfire, or continue up the path and confront the hammer wielding [Steelworker Undead](/Hammersmith "Dark Souls 2 Hammersmith") near the plank bridge. After he's dealt with, cross the small wooded bridge, head up the stairs and down a path to the left under a windmill blade. Continuing on into a tunnel, you'll come upon a broken statue drenched in sunlight. It is similar (exactly the same?) to the one in Dark Souls 1 and allows players to join the [Heirs of the Sun](/Heirs+of+the+Sun "Dark Souls 2 Heirs of the Sun") covenant and learn the 'Praise the Sun' gesture.

### To the Earthen Peak

Returning from the Heirs of the Sun shrine, you can either go left, or right, down the ramp, then left (instead of crossing the bridge), and at the end left again. If you take the second way, be careful of an [Masked Manikin](/Masked+Manikin "Dark Souls 2 Masked Manikin") on an high ledge to the right. Both ways bring you towards the entrance to [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak"). In both cases, you will be entering an area filled with poison urns, as well as an [Undead Steelworker](/Undead+Steelworker "Dark Souls 2 Undead Steelworker"), alerted when you enter. They will crush through the poison urns and coat themselves with it, so just let them come towards you and die from the poison, or take them out of their misery quickly. You will also notice that both entrances will be connected to a ladder, right before the doorways to [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak"). If you take the upper route, be careful of another [Undead Steelworker](/Undead+Steelworker "Dark Souls 2 Undead Steelworker") greeting you.

### Soul Farming Tips

If you have lightning or ranged attacks, it's very easy to farm the giants that spawn near the Mines bonfire (2nd one) for 750 each. If you go the extra step of killing the two just past the quarry after the bonfire as well, you can get 3k souls or more very quickly with little time/effort and just a few lightning spears/dark orbs/any form of ranged attacks that deal roughly 200 damage minimum.

### Harvest Valley Walkthrough

### The First Bonfire & Chloanne

From the [Skeleton Lords](/Skeleton+Lords "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton Lords") boss area in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse"), head through the doorway in that room and continue on a path leading to a raised bridge. Pull the lever on the right to lower the bridge and cross over into **Harvest Valley**. As you move along the rocky pathways you will soon encounter a pool of poison to your right blocking a cave which harbors the first **Bonfire**. Defeating the boss in Earthen Peak will drain the pool is drained. However, as that comes later, cross quickly but don't roll as that covers your entire body in poison rather than only your legs. Once you've used the bonfire, head back across the poison pool, and up the right side the hill to encounter the NPC [Stone Trader Chloanne](/Stone+Trader+Chloanne "Dark Souls 2 Stone Trader Chloanne"). Exhaust her dialogue to move her to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula").

### Loot Pit

Peering over the edge, you can spot a rather large enemy standing in the middle of a poison lake, a [Banedigger](/Banedigger "Dark Souls 2 Banedigger"); this guy uses Dark Orbs. Use this vantage point to defeat him with ranged attacks, as battling in the poison mist is too unnecessarily risky. After dispatching him, head down the path to your left and continue to walk along the ledge to find a spawning [Skeleton](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") and a corpse holding a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). In the poison mist you can see a plethora of items scattered all over the area. There are also a few more [Skeletons](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") that spawn when traversing this area. Tank up on anti-poison items of your choice and plunder:

  * 5x [Fading Soul ](/Fading+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Fading Soul")
  * 2x [Titanite Shard ](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard")
  * 10x [Poison Throwing Knife ](/Poison+Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Poison Throwing Knife")
  * 2x [Small Smooth & Silky Stone ](/Small+Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth %26 Silky Stone")
  * 1x [Titanite Chunk ](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk")

Head through the small archway in the middle of the lakes wall and kill the skeleton to your right. Circle around the left of the poison pit to loot a corpse holding a [Fragrant Branch Of Yore ](/Fragrant+Branch+Of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch Of Yore") and a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). Continue along the ledge and enter the hole in the wall to find the NPC [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan") (If you talked to him previously in [No-man's Wharf](/No-man's+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man's Wharf")). Behind him is a chest containing [Raw Stone](/Raw+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Raw Stone"). Exiting this room, in this same cave, down in the mist, there should be a small alcove to the left of the slope leading down. In here you'll find a chest containing a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed") and a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing").

### To the Second Bonfire

Leave this cave, back out to the open and head up the slope to where you found the single [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). Continue along and you'll arrive to the greetings of two more [Banediggers](/Banedigger "Dark Souls 2 Banedigger") in the small valley. Climb the ladder that you first come across on the right for a better vantage point and 10x [Hexing Urns](/Hexing+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Hexing Urn"). You will also find multiple [Undead](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") around the area. Climb the second ladder on the right to arrive at a lever. Pull it to raise the wooden gate blocking the exit. Head through and turn right to reach the second **Bonfire.**

****

### Quarry of Options

Past this bonfire, you'll come upon a small quarry with several holes filled with poisonous gas. Along the left wall is a path leading up to a boarded off area, and an opening on the right, ignore the opening for now.

As you approach the wall a [Banedigger](/Banedigger "Dark Souls 2 Banedigger") will burst through. Instead of killing him, get around him and bait him into destroying another wall (NG+ there is a Sickle Wielding Giant Phantom hiding behind it). With the wall gone and the giant dead claim the treasure:

  * 1x [Old Knight Pike](/Old+Knight+Pike "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight Pike")
  * 1x [Old Knight Greatshield](/Old+Knight+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight Greatshield")
  * 1x [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead")
  * 1x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch")
  * 1x [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem")
  * x1 [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth %26 Silky Stone")

Near where the Giant was is a small ledge you can drop off, onto a chest containing a [Poison Stone](/Poison+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Poison Stone") and 3x [Rotten Pine Resin](/Rotten+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Rotten Pine Resin"). The only way out is down into a gas filled tunnel with a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). At the end of the tunnel is a ladder leading back to the small quarry. From here, return to the path with the [Banedigger](/Banedigger "Dark Souls 2 Banedigger") and enter the opening we ignored earlier.

### Huntsmen Ambush

Once you're through there, 4 [Undead Huntsmen](/Undead+Huntsman "Dark Souls 2 Undead Huntsman") will converge from the sides, and a small wall raises behind you, blocking a potential escape the same way you entered. You can kite them and use the raised pathways as a bottle neck. You can also escape the area by going up the ramp, to the right, then breaking through the third set of boards. This is actually **the easiest way** , because than you can pick them one by one with a halberd, by sniping, and/or spells. Once all the enemies are cleared out, break the rest of the boards and claim the remaining loot of the area which includes:

  * 1x [Simpleton's Spice](/Simpleton%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton%27s Spice")
  * 1x [Skeptic's Spice](/Skeptic%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic%27s Spice")
  * x1 [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem")
  * 5x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem")
  * 1x [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard")
  * 1x [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard")
  * 1x [Large Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Large+Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Brave Warrior")
  * 3x [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom")

One of the boards hides 2 hollows. With loot in hand, head for the exit tunnel. At the next intersection go left to find a Crystal Lizard. Run in and dispatch it quickly, but do not follow if it falls into the hole. Dropping down will instantly kill you. Going the other way you will find yourself on a ledge overlooking the small quarry. Loot a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") from the body near the edge.

### Heirs of the Sun Covenant Cave

It is time to enter one of the aforementioned, poison holes. Look for the one with a lootable body at the bottom and hop in. Grab the [Fading Soul](/Fading+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Fading Soul") from it and run down the tunnel. Near the exit is another [Simpleton's Spice](/Simpleton%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton%27s Spice"). The tunnel leads to another gas filled pit with two more [Banediggers](/Banedigger "Dark Souls 2 Banedigger"). Run up the nearby ramp for a breather, and dispatch of them with ranged attacks, if you desire. Scattered across the floor of the pit, are several lootable bodies holding:

  * 1x [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard")
  * 1x [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard")
  * 1x [Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Brave Warrior")
  * 1x [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy")
  * [Chameleon](/Chameleon "Dark Souls 2 Chameleon") Sorcery 

Once back up the ramp continue up the path and confront the hammer wielding [Undead Steelworker](/Undead+Steelworker "Dark Souls 2 Undead Steelworker") near the plank bridge. After he's dealt with, cross the small wooded bridge, head up the stairs and down a path to the left under a windmill blade. Continuing on into a tunnel, you'll face an [executioner](/executioner "Dark Souls 2 executioner") before you'll come upon a broken statue drenched in sunlight. It is similar (exactly the same?) to the one in Dark Souls 1 and allows players to join the [Heirs of the Sun](/Heirs+of+the+Sun "Dark Souls 2 Heirs of the Sun") covenant and learn the 'Praise the Sun' gesture.

### To the Earthen Peak

Returning to the bottom of the stairs near the bridge from earlier, you can take the path to the right which curves left and to a room full of poison urns. Take it slow: a [Undead Steelworker](/Undead+Steelworker "Dark Souls 2 Undead Steelworker") will aggro as you approach, breaking a few urns which spew poison in the process. Just let him come to you. There's another Undead Steelworker waiting for you inside the doorway on the left. Once in the room, you'll see a ladder which accesses a higher walkway in the same room with yet another Undead Steelworker on that level; to pull him, go back out to the bridge and straight up to the top of the stairs -- this is another entry to the same upper walkway. He'll aggro as you approach him.

Once all the mobs are dealt with, head back into the room. From here, there are two entrances to [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak"): the ladder, and the other straight out the doorway. Take the lower route If you're eager to get the nearby [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard") in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") for details.

### Soul Farming Tips

If you have lightning or ranged attacks, it's very easy to farm the giants that spawn near the Mines bonfire (2nd one) for 750 each. If you go the extra step of killing the two just past the quarry after the bonfire as well, you can get 3k souls or more very quickly with little time/effort and just a few lightning spears/dark orbs/any form of ranged attacks that deal roughly 200 damage minimum.
