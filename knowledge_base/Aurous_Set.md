**Aurous Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. 

  
  
_"Helm/Armor/Gauntlets/Leggings of kings of the desert land of Jugo. First worn by Aurous, the land's heroic founder._   
_According to legend, the armor of Aurous is composed of a mysterious substance that cannot be seen by cowards. What do your eyes tell you? "_

### Set Location

  * In Dark Souls II: The entire visible set drops in different parts by a dark spirit in No-Man's Wharf that invades on the ship on NG+ and above, thought the chances are rare (spawns once). 
  * In The Scholar of the First Sin: Found in a chest near Heide Knight (wearing Iron Mask) in The Gutter. To find the knight, reach the first Swollen Mongrel past the first long bridge, turn to the opposite direction, cross the house and drop down.

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
