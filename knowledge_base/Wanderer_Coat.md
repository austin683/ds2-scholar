_"A Coat for the roving type._

_Light, sturdy leather made for long journeys."_

### Location

  * Starting equipment from the [Swordsman](/Swordsman).
  * [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille): Knock the rock into the well and kill the three mummy enemies, the third one drops the entire set. They do not respawn (Not even with Ascetics). 
    * Note: I did not get the drop. I lured them into the first courtyard, below the Heide Knight. Not sure if that's why...
    * I climbed the ladder in their spawn area and picked them off and it did not drop. I did the same thing on another character though and it did drop. No idea if that affects it.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Wanderer Set](/Wanderer+Set).
  * Upgraded from [Titanite](/Titanite+Slab).
