**Whips** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a type of [Weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") that are unique as they have no blade or blunt surface to strike with, which makes them inefective against enemies with armor or scales. Whips also have low durability, but have considerable range and an unpredictable hitbox, which is perfect for confusing your opponent. The radius of the Whips' attacks can be good when dealing with multiple enemies. Whips cannot be parried or riposted, with this, Whips also cannot perform backstabs, riposte, and plunging attacks. There is a unique trait that all Whips have in common that's useful especially in PvP, it's that Whips do not display the augmentation applied to the weapon, not until an attack with the weapon is released. This allows players to hide their augmentation and make the opponent stay on their feet. This page covers a list of all Whips in Dark Souls 2.
