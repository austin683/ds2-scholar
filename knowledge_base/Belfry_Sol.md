### Notes

  * A rare black phantom NPC called the [Mad Warrior](/Mad+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Mad Warrior") can spawn in the corner in front of the tower with the ladder used to access the rooftop. He is a very rare spawn, and he can drop the [Mad Warrior set](/Mad+Warrior+Set "Dark Souls 2 Mad Warrior Set") as well as the [Berserker Blade](/Berserker+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Berserker Blade"), both with a rare drop rate. In order for him to spawn, one must be a part of the [Bell Keeper](/Bell+Keepers "Dark Souls 2 Bell Keepers") covenant. See the Mad Warrior page for tips on farming / encouraging him to spawn. This NPC can be used to help level the Bell Keeper Covenant up. 
    * The dual wield avelyn Phantoms do not respawn and have a chance to drop the Black Witch Domino Mask. You can reset them by using a Bonfire Ascetic.
  * This is a highly active PvP area, entering it online **WILL** result in at least one invasion, with potential of three (two gray invaders and a red or blue).

  * You may co-op in this area by placing your sign quickly, then moving back into a 'safe' zone such as the end area through the fog.

  * You can skip this area and return to the ledge before the bonfire by climbing the ladder, standing on the side opposite at the top and walking forward angled to the right of the ladder. This is only useful if you decided to skip the Smelter Demon and need another bonfire since the area in itself is optional or if you are unable to wade through the sea of invaders.
