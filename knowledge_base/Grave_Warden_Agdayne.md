### Grave Warden Agdayne Information in Dark Souls 2

  * Grave Warden Agdayne sells a variety of useful spells such as the powerful Soul Spear. He is also the only NPC who sells "Warmth". This spell is required for the "Pyromancy Master" achievement/trophy.
  * Immune to Poison as well as Dark Fog.
  * If spoken to first, he can be summoned as a white phantom just before Velstadt, the Royal Aegis, where he'll wield the Crypt Blacksword. Facing the fog wall, his sign is on your left, between the two final pillars.
  * **If approached with a light source, he will permanently become hostile** and unsummonable as a white phantom. This includes approaching with the torch wielding hollow that follows you at the start of the level still in tow, so beware! However if you ask [Cromwell](/Cromwell+the+Pardoner "Dark Souls 2 Cromwell the Pardoner") to pardon your sins, Agdayne will become non-hostile again.  

    * Phantom and Invaders cannot aggro Agdayne in host's world with [Cast Light](/Cast+Light "Dark Souls 2 Cast Light").
    * However, Red & Blue Phantom invaders **CAN** aggro Agdayne by luring the Torch Hollow to his place with [Alluring Skull](/Alluring+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Alluring Skull"), the countermeasure for the host would be [Seed of a Tree of Giant](/Seed+of+a+Tree+of+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Seed of a Tree of Giants").
    * Moreover, White & Gold Phantom griefers can also aggro Agdayne by luring the Torch Hollow to his place with [Yearn](/Yearn "Dark Souls 2 Yearn").
    * Without a light source present, the [Grave Warden](/Grave+Warden "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden") accompanying Agdayne will not aggro unless attacked first. (Attacking them does NOT aggro Agdayne)
  * Drops [Agdayne's Black Kilt](/Agdayne's+Black+Kilt "Dark Souls 2 Agdayne's Black Kilt").
  * If spoken to after acquiring the [King's Ring](/King%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Ring") he will give you: 
    * [Agdayne's Set](/Agdayne%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Agdayne%27s Set")
    * [Darkdrift](/Darkdrift "Dark Souls 2 Darkdrift")

### Grave Warden Agdayne Dialogue

**\- When first met, if the player is carrying a torch**  
Halt.  
Human. Put that light out.  
Light, and all those who bear it, are unwelcome in this place.

**\- When first met, if the player is not carrying a torch**  
Halt.  
Human. Do not produce light.  
Light, and all those who bear it, are unwelcome in this place.

**\- If the player gets close to him while carrying a torch**  
I warned you.  
You offend the dead. And now, you will join them.

**\- When talking**  
I am Agdayne. Guardian of the crypt.  
Countless dead rest here in peace. Cradled by the comfort of dark.  
Light only agitates. We have no need for it here.

**\- When talking a second time / Use 'Talk' option**  
I am a Fenito. We weave death, and watch over the dead.  
This task was granted to me by the one who gave us the first death.  
Countless souls rest here. Some of them from ages long ago.  
Some were rich, others poor. Some wise, some dull, but now, they are all just dead.

**\- When talking a third time**  
Did you come for him? The one called Vendrick.  
You will find him deeper inside.  
Many castle servants and the like have come to fetch their lord.  
But they rest here now, put to death by the King's own guards.  
Perhaps he's not in the mood for company.

**\- When talking a fourth time / Use 'Talk' option**  
In the past, humans were one with the dark.  
The former King of Light…He feared humans. Feared that they would usher in an age of dark.  
How queer, you humans. How you go on, never separating truth from fiction.

**\- When talking a fifth time / Use 'Talk' option**  
This place is welcome to all, provided due reverence is shown.  
Death is equitable, accepting. We will all, one day, be welcomed by her embrace.  
Tell me what you desire. Show me reverence, and I will lend you my hand.

**\- When talking to open interaction menu**  
What do you require, human?

**\- When leaving, having used his services**  
Farewell, human.

**\- When walking off without closing the menu**  
Going so soon?  
We will meet again, eventually.

**\- When leaving, having not used his services**  
Crude human, do as you please.

**\- Unknown**  
…

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
You've met the King, have you?  
Life is never easy, never fair. Even more so, on this path you've chosen.  
May you find your peace one day.  
Take these with you. You may need them, as proof of your visit here.

**\- When attacked but not aggroed**  
Hmph…  
(or)  
What are you doing.  
(or)  
Are you mad, human?

**\- When attacked and aggroed**  
Crude human, know your place!

**\- When killing the player**  
Now, where shall we bury this one?

**\- When re-encountered after aggroing**  
The insolent will be punished.

**\- When attacked and health is under 50%**  
The impunity…

**\- When killed**  
Hah hah…You fool.

**\- Unknown**  
A long rest awaits me. Farewell, human.
