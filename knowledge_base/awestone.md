### DKS2 Bonfire Ascetics Farming Strategies

  * **Aldia's Keep Black Phantom -** use [Bonfire Ascetics](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") to keep respawning the dark phantom in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia's+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia's Keep") until you hit 50 awestones.
  * **Doors of Pharros Black Phantom -**(confirmed on 1.03 ) on NG+ with version 1.00 [Bowman Guthry](/Bowman+Guthry "Dark Souls 2 Bowman Guthry") invades every time you walk into the area and gives awestones upon being defeated. Use an ascetic at the royal rat authorities bonfire [(Ordeal's End)](/Ordeal%27s+End "Dark Souls 2 Ordeal%27s End"), [Gyrm's Respite](/Gyrm%27s+Respite "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm%27s Respite") does not affect Guthry's area. Some players may find him easier to farm than [Rhoy the Explorer](/Rhoy+The+Explorer "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy The Explorer"); he doesn't become aggressive until approached, so the [Mastodon](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight") and Rat at the area's start can be fought separately from him quite easily. He seems to only use non-elemental [Avelyn](/Avelyn "Dark Souls 2 Avelyn"), firing one at a time and with some delay between attacks. He also moves slowly through the water and doesn't evade very often, so fighting him using a 100% damage reduction shield and a melee weapon is very effective at killing him. He is also very easy to poison using [Dark Fog.](/Dark+Fog "Dark Souls 2 Dark Fog") (This method worked for me but I had to go to offline mode before he would invade at all)

  * **The Gutter Black Phantom (s) -** If you have released [Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan"), he will invade you in the Gutter near the ladder that leads to [Havel's](/Havel%27s+Armor+Set "Dark Souls 2 Havel%27s Armor Set") set, after killing him you can return to the bonfire then take the right path and go down to where the undead with the Torch is on the cliff. After clearing out the undead there and going to where the Iron Chest is, upon returning to the cliff where the torch undead was [Melinda the Butcher](/Melinda+the+Butcher "Dark Souls 2 Melinda the Butcher") should invade. (Her invasion seems to be scripted sometimes you'll have to repeat going past the chest and making sure all of the cliff enemies are killed before she invades)  
Both Navlaan and Melinda will invade you each time you use an [Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") I got 30 Awestones using this method as it gets you two Awestones per Ascetic. This is one of the safer ways to farm it with Ascetics since The Gutter is a relatively harmless place to make it harder. Also, bear in mind that the Wooden chest in Melinda's area respawns each time and has a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") and 3 [Small Smooth and Silky Stones](/Small+Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth %26 Silky Stone") in it.
  * **[Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") Black Phantom- _By far the most effective way to farm_** 50 Awestones. Go to the [Grave Entrance ](/Grave+Entrance "Dark Souls 2 Grave Entrance")Bonfire in [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints"), and burn a [bonfire ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). He will invade 12 times before needing to use bonfire ascetics (on the [First Bonfire](/Harval%27s+Resting+Place "Dark Souls 2 Harval%27s Resting Place") of Grave of Saints). If you can afford a [Pharros Lockstone](/Pharros+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros Lockstone") you can easily knock him off the near bridge and still get the Awestone drop direct in your inventory. Rhoy also has a small chance to drop an Awestone in addition to the one deposited to your inventory, so if you can handle him, it might be worth it to kill him in a way where you can get his drop (not from falling off the bridge, for example). Note: the NPC will only spawn once in NG, using bonfire ascetics will make it spawn 12 times per ascetic. With [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring +2](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring") and other Item Drop Increase gear, you should get 50 Awestones in 4 Ascetics. I got about 20% more Awestones using the Covetous Gold Serpent Ring, [Jester's Cap](/Jester%27s+Cap "Dark Souls 2 Jester%27s Cap"), and [Prisoner's Tatters.](/Prisoner%27s+Tatters "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner%27s Tatters") The use of a weapon that can stunlock him is highly recommended or a [Great Club](/Great+Club "Dark Souls 2 Great Club") using the 2 handed heavy attack.   
  
**NOTE:** As of SotFS, and ONLY on SotFS, Rhoy will respawn INDEFINITELY at bonfire intensity 2 or higher.

Another way use a lockstone at the floor Rhoy invades and use [Lingering Flame](/Lingering+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Lingering Flame") across the bridge as the rats will not follow you and will damage him before he gets to you, I was able to kill with 4 and then a few [Great Fireballs,](/Great+Fireball "Dark Souls 2 Great Fireball") have strong armor on to not worry about dodging too often as you will kill him before you lose half,   
**Videos**

  * **[The Place Unbeknownst](/The+Place+Unbeknownst "Dark Souls 2 The Place Unbeknownst") Navlaan -** he can be respawned with Bonfire Ascetic from the [Giant Lord area,](/Memory+Of+Jeigh "Dark Souls 2 Memory Of Jeigh") in short, infinite supplies of Awestone as long as you have at least 1 Bonfire Ascetic on your hand.
