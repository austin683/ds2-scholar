> The nature of the link between the Estus flasks and the bonfires that illuminate the world of the Undead is entirely unknown.  
> But that is of little concern, for any Undead knows the value of these precious flasks.

### Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Usage

Healing item. Upgraded with two separate items:

  * [Estus Flask Shards](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard")

Can be taken to the [Emerald Herald](/Emerald+Herald "Dark Souls 2 Emerald Herald") in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") to allow for more uses of the flask (one shard allows one extra use, 12 flasks max)

  * [Sublime Bone Dust](/Sublime+Bone+Dust "Dark Souls 2 Sublime Bone Dust")

Increases the amount that each sip of the flask heals. To use it, burn at the [Bonfire](/Bonfire "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire") in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). (Maximum is +5)

  * Going to New Game+ does not increase the maximum limit.

Pressing the action button repeatedly whilst the bottle is at the mouth of the player allows multiple drinks to be taken without the bottle being put away. This can allow for rapid health regeneration.   
You can also drink while on a ladder.

Higher agility allows characters to use the Estus Flask with greater speed, meaning the player is exposed for less time while using it.

At 95 Agility, it takes 63 frames (2.1 seconds).
