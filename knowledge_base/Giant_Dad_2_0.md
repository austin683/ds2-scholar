#  GIANT DAD 2.0

_"The Legend never dies. These are the words of the Champions, ancient warriors whose purpose was to destroy the filthy casuls that roamed Lordran. They worship no god, except for their eternal master and creator, OnlyAfro. These warriors were known for their tremendous skill, far from the petty peasants that plagued the land before their existence. With the help of skill and knowledge (and a Chaos Zweihander +5), the Legends became immortal."_

Then, cast Homing Soulmass and after selecting the Sunset Staff in your left hand and your weapon of choice in your right one, buff it with Crystal Magic Weapon. If your opponent bows, strike him relentlessly. Forget about honor, you're there to show them you're unstoppable . If you're dueling by a bridge or open area where your opponent can fall into his death, use your Greatsword's running RB/R1 attack to send your foe flying into the air, possibly making him fall for an easy kill. If you're in a more confined space, try to hit him horizontally with your weapon's R1 attack. When your opponent falls into the ground, make sure you cast one of your poisoning/equipment degrading spells while he's down to deal even more damage, or luckily to break his equipment. Don't stop fighting while he's healing, go behind him and backstab or cast one of your spells if you have the opportunity. / After obliterating them, always remind to end your invasion by taunting them and, if you have one, dancing with the Channeler's Trident. Good luck! / |
