**Pyromancy Flame** is a **[Flame](/Flames "Dark Souls 2 Flames")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Pyromancy Flame** is a flame catalyst used by pyromancers to conjure various fire arts. It can be found right after defeating the [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry") in No-Man's Wharf, stored in a metal chest along with [Fireball](/Fireball "Dark Souls 2 Fireball"). The **Pyromancy Flame** gains S rank scaling when upgraded four times. When two-handling it, it consumes more stamina per cast but deals the same damage as when used with one hand, thus it's more stamina efficient to use it with one hand.

> A flame catalyst used by pyromancers.   
>   
> Pyromancers rouse this flame to produce various fire arts. Equip pyromancy flame to produce pyromancy. Attune pyromancies at a bonfire.   
>   
> The strength of a pyromancy depends on the strength of one's pyromancy flame, which can be improved through reinforcement. 

###  **Acquired From**

  * Right after defeating the [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry") in [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man%27s Wharf"), climb the ladder but do not activate the navigational device. Instead, look around for a metal chest containing the Pyromancy Flame. The same chest contains [Fireball](/Fireball "Dark Souls 2 Fireball").
  * If you do activate the navigational device, the [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") and [Fireball](/Fireball "Dark Souls 2 Fireball") will remain in the same chest. However, leaving the area implies that you will have to either use a Homeward Bone before reaching the next bonfire or travel back to No-Man's Wharf later in order to retrieve it.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Fire damage increases with [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") upgrade.
  * The flame can be upgraded by [Carhillion of the Fold](/Carhillion+of+the+Fold "Dark Souls 2 Carhillion of the Fold") and [Rosabeth of Melfia](/Rosabeth+of+Melfia "Dark Souls 2 Rosabeth of Melfia") using the "Reinforce Pyromancy Flame" option.
  * Does not directly scale off of any stat, but does scale with the Fire ATK Bonus, which is affected by both Intelligence and Faith.
  * Fire damage soft cap hit is when Intelligence + Faith = 60.
  * It gains S ranks scaling when upgraded 4 times.
  * While two-handling it will consume more stamina per cast and will do the same damage that using it on one hand, to make it more stamina efficient only use this on one hand.
