**Great Hammers** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a type of [Weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") that's considered among the largest weapon types in the game. All Great Hammers deal Strike damage, and since they're larger than normal weapons, their attacks are extremely slow, but very powerful. Similar to [Hammers](/Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Hammers"), landing a hit with Great Hammers can easily stagger opponents. They are also best wielded with both hands, as they have a high Strength requirement. Just like Hammers, the first strike is the most important, the starting and ending animation of its attacks can confuse opponents, best used for defensive and turtling enemies. This page covers a list of all Great Hammers in Dark Souls 2.
