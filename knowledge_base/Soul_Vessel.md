### Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel Usage

  * Give to Strowen in Things Betwixt and you will have the option to redistribute your Soul Level points.
  * This item is a [Consumable](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") and thus one-time use.
  * Does not allow the reallocation of base class stats. Only the points that the player has allocated can be reallocated.
  * No souls will be lost by using this item, but you cannot gain souls or lower your Soul Level by saving Soul Level Points.

### Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel Locations

  * 1 can be obtained from [Crestfallen Saulden](/Crestfallen+Saulden "Dark Souls 2 Crestfallen Saulden") after you bring 4 people to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula").
  * 1 could be found in the special chest in [Majula's](/majula "Dark Souls 2 majula") Mansion before patch 2.24. (Can still be found there in SOTFS)
  * 1 can be found in an iron chest [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") past the Central Castle Drangleic bonfire after activating the elevator and in the area with the imprisoned Milfanto.
  * 1 can be found in a wooden chest in [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille") behind a [Pharros' Door](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros"). Note that if the chest is destroyed, you will only get [rubbish](/rubbish "Dark Souls 2 rubbish").
  * 1 can be found on a corpse in [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Orro") on the lowest level.
  * 1 can be found in a wooden chest in [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") fall to a platform in the room with the lowerable bridge.
  * 1 can be found in an iron chest in [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon%27s+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Sanctum").
  * 2 can be found in an iron chest in Brume Tower behind a rather obvious illusionary wall, between the first and second bonfires
  * 1 can be found in Frozen Eleum Loyce in a frozen chest on a roof before the second bonfire.

**Farming**

  * The bonfire at [The Place Unbeknownst](/The+Place+Unbeknownst "Dark Souls 2 The Place Unbeknownst") can reset the Memories' items with the [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). The [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Orro"), the memory after the Pursuer fog door, has a corpse with the Soul vessel but you will need to defeat the [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord") each time to use a Bonfire Ascetic.
  * An alternate method of farming is to burn a bonfire ascetic at the Exile Holding Cells bonfire in the [ Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"). It resets the chest with the soul vessel and no area boss needs to be beaten every time. It's considerably easier than farming soul vessels in the giant memories.
