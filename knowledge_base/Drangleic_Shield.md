**Drangleic Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Captain Drummond's shield. Even with its embossing terribly worn, this shield exudes pride and authority._

     _An heirloom passed from grandfather to father, and then from father to son.  
Drummond, and those before him, held this shield when facing those who would threaten their great land."_

### DKS2 Drangleic Shield Acquired From :

  * You have to beat the [Pursuer](/The+Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 The Pursuer"), the second boss in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). Go past his boss area, and jump down the hole in the walkway in front of you. There's a body down there with the [Drangleic Set](/Drangleic+Set "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Set") (without the helm), the [Drangleic Sword](/Drangleic+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Sword"), and most importantly, the [Drangleic Shield](/Drangleic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Shield").

### Drangleic Shield Hints and Tips in Dark Souls 2:

  * Upgrades with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * This is probably the best medium shield available early game with 100% physical block and high stability, and can easily last you to the end of the game (though there are better ones later on). It is highly recommended that you defeat the Pursuer as early as possible and grab this shield if you have the strength to wield it.
  * Useful until you get [Defender's Shield](/Defender%27s+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Defender%27s Shield"), which is considered to be an endgame item.
  * This shield appears in _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Kite Shield](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Kite+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Kite Shield").
  * Prior to Calibration 1.15, the magic reduction was only 50 for a non-infused, non-upgraded Drangleic Shield. After this calibration, it now has 70 magic reduction.
