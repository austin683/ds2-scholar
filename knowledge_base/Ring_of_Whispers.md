Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

### DS2 Ring of Whispers Tips and Notes

  * Can **not** be used in PvP. Controlled testing has proven this rumor to be false; you cannot use voice chat outside of regular co-op. can NOT drop for another player when summoned. it disappears.
  * The growl plays in the Grave of Saints as well. The ring is linked to Rhoy The Explorer (however, the ring does not allow you to speak with the invading NPC).
  * Allows you to talk with [Manscorpion Tark](/Manscorpion+Tark "Dark Souls 2 Manscorpion Tark"), husband of [Scorpioness Najka](/Scorpioness+Najka "Dark Souls 2 Scorpioness Najka")
  * The "growls" are thought to be them saying "I'm hungry." or "Come over here." 
  * Allows you to hear a strange growl in the Queens throne room (Not Confirmed, I went in there NG + no growl)?
