### Acquired From

  * Obtained from Pilgrims of the Dark covenant Rank 3

### Notes

  * Consumes **ALL** held souls upon casting of the spell. Maximum damage at 5000 souls cost. An upgrade to [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul), its damage is increased by roughly 180%. This spell deals the highest damage in game.  
Strategy: Use [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic) to farm [Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior) or [Giant Lord Soul](/Giant+Lord+Soul) at different locations in game, effectively getting a supply of 5000 souls for casting the spell at any time.
  * Deals more poise damage than [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul), ignores Dark [Transgressor's Leather Shield](/Transgressor%27s+Leather+Shield) even when it's fully upgraded, can be identified by its distinctive sound upon flying by.
