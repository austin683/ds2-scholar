### Tseldora Den Key Usage in Dark Souls 2

  * Opens a locked door in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). Before it, there is another one that says ''too heavy to open''. Smash the door with a strong attack. After that use the key on the locked door. There are two chests inside (be careful, the chest on the left is trapped and will explode when opened). One of these chests has the [Engraved Gauntlets](/Engraved+Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Engraved Gauntlets"). 
  * If you kill [Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate") at the very beginning of the game in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") you can still exhaust [Creighton](/Creighton+the+Wanderer "Dark Souls 2 Creighton the Wanderer")'s dialogue and meet him in Tseldora. He will figure out that you killed Pate before him and demand that you hand over the [Ring of Thorns](/Ring+of+Thorns "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Thorns"). If you hand it over he will give you the key. 
    * Note: Only by attacking one of the two and helping finish the target will the surviving party thank you and give you the key. If you do not attack either, the survivor will regard you as if you did not help at all and will not give the key.
