  * This spell will restore 20 durability regardless of your stats or gear.
  * Casting this sorcery repairs most of your equipment (weapons, armor and rings) as long as it isn't broken. 
    * However, a staff must be drawn in one hand to be able to use it, like any other sorcery.
  * When using this spell, only the weapon in your other active hand will be repaired at the moment of casting.

  * You can reduce the cost of this sorcery to 10 int if you use a simpleton's spice on the repair sorcery.
