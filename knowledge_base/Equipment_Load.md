**Equipment Load** is [stat](/Stats "Dark Souls 2 Stats") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Equipment Load influences the player's walking, rolling, and stamina recovery. For more on that last part, see [Stamina](/Stamina "Dark Souls 2 Stamina") page.

### Equipment Load Information

Every character starts with 38.5 maximum equip burden regardless of stats, and is then added 1.5 units to the maximum for every [Vitality](/Vitality "Dark Souls 2 Vitality") point up to 29. This is when diminishing return kicks in and you start gaining less and less with every stat point invested.  
For example, a [Warrior](/Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Warrior") will start out with 38.5 + 6 Vitality (9) = 47.5 maximum equip burden, a [Bandit](/Bandit "Dark Souls 2 Bandit") will start with 38.5 + 11 Vitality (16.5) = 55 maximum equip burden.   
  
You can increase your maximum equip burden by using:

  * [Aurous Set](/Aurous+Set "Dark Souls 2 Aurous Set")
  * [First Dragon Ring](/First+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 First Dragon Ring")
  * [Second Dragon Ring](/Second+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Second Dragon Ring")
  * [Third Dragon Ring](/Third+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Third Dragon Ring")
  * [Royal Soldier's Ring](/Royal+Soldier%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier%27s Ring")
  * [Penal Mask](/Penal+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Penal Mask")
  * [Vengarl Helm](/Vengarl%27s+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Vengarl%27s Helm")

  
These items will increase maximum equip burden multiplicatively (only tested with rings)   
So, a character with 25 Vitality will get an increase of 37.5 Equipment Load. (25 * 1.5 = 37.5)   
Total: 76 Equipment Load   
Adding a [Royal Soldier's Ring](/Royal+Soldier%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier%27s Ring") (Increase Maximum Load by 10%) and [Third Dragon Ring](/Third+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Third Dragon Ring") (Increase Maximum Load by 12.5%)   
(76 * 1.1) * 1.125 = 94.1 Equipment Load (Exact was 94.05 but Dark Souls 2 rounds to the nearest tenth)   
  
Another example to show round-off:   
Character with 14 Vitality gets an increase of 21 Equipment Load   
Total: 59.5 Equipment Load   
Adding [Royal Soldier's Ring](/Royal+Soldier%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier%27s Ring") (Increase to Maximum Load by 10%)  and [Second Dragon Ring](/Second+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Second Dragon Ring") (Increase to Maximum Load by 10%)   
(59.5 * 1.1) * 1.1 = 72.0 Equipment Load (Exact was 71.995)   
  
Your equipment load percentage is in the bottom right in the equipment screen.

  * The higher your percentage, the slower your stamina bar will recover stamina. [The change appears to be linear](/Equipment+Load#StaminaRecoveryGraph "Dark Souls 2 Equipment Load#StaminaRecoveryGraph").
  * The higher your percentage, the shorter your roll distance
  * If your equip load percentage is greater than 70%, your roll will be significantly slower. Up to 70%, all roll speed is the same.
  * If your equip load percentage is greater than %100, [your walk, run, and sprint speeds become slower](/Equipment+Load#EquipLoadEffects "Dark Souls 2 Equipment Load#EquipLoadEffects")

Note: Decrease in walk, run and sprint speed become greater capping at over encumbered at 120% rendering you unable to run, sprint and use evasive actions. Combo attacks that utilize the roll and jump back. Can still be used at own risk.
