## Lord's Private Chamber Enemies

  

  

###  [Headless Vengarl](/Headless+Vengarl) (Vengarl's Body)

  

The decapitated body of Vengarl of Forossa. Separated from its head, during a brutal war long ago and now somehow ambulatory once again, it wanders in search of the battles it knew in life as though reanimated by its bloodlust...   

  * Packs a punch but is easier to stagger than he looks, and can be quickly taken out if you get the first strike.

  

  

###  [Tseldoran Settler](/Tseldoran+Settler) (Duke Tseldora)

  

Propertier of Brightstone Cove and founder of the mining town which once flourished there. Duke Tseldora disappeared after the town was suddenly and mysteriously overrun by spiders and was never heard from again. Though the circumstances surrounding Brighstone Cove's desctruction remain unclear, the murky truth behind Duke Tseldora's disappearance seems somehow related to his unnatural obsession with spiders...
