Players can acquire the Drangleic Sword as a treasure in the Forest of Fallen Giants after defeating the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer"). Upgradable with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5, the **Drangleic Sword** is considered one of the best greatswords obtainable early in the game.

> An heirloom passed from grandfather to father, and then from father to son. Drummond, and those before him, used this sword to repel those who would threaten their great land.

### How to get Drangleic Sword in Dark Souls 2

  * Treasure in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") after you defeat the [ Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer"). Walk past the area you fought him in and you will see a hole in the ground. Dropping into the hole will reveal a corpse, which will include the Drangleic Set (excluding helmet) as well as the Drangleic Sword and shield.

### DS2 Drangleic Sword Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with: [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5.
  * This sword is one of the best greatswords that can be obtained early on in the game. However, it upgrades with Twinkling Titanite, which can be very difficult to find much of in the early game.
  * It has a very quick moveset, with little wind up, or recovery. Has rapid, wide swings for one handed fast attack, and a long-reaching lunge for one handed strong attack. Two handed attacks are also very quick for a greatsword.
  * Your mileage may vary for how good its moveset is. Its heavy attacks do not combo with the standard attacks AT ALL, and all of its attack animations have a lot of unnecessary flourish to them. This weapon is useful, however it is recommended to acquire the [Claymore](/Claymore "Dark Souls 2 Claymore") (purchased from Vengarl in the Shaded Woods), which has lower stat requirements, a better moveset, more range, and nearly-as-good scaling.
