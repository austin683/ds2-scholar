Like most of you (maybe) have love to read a book, I have the first of Eragon's saga by 10 years (as a gift in the christmas 2004), I was only 9, too young to read a novel.   
Anyway the last month I basically eat all the saga, and when I done I was attempted to bring my version of Eragon on Dark Souls 2, and that's it.   
That's only a cosplay, nothing more.   
How to get all the stuff on NG?   
Use bonfire ascetic, a easy method to farming it, it's join the ["dark hood covenant"](http://Pilgrims%20of%20Dark), doing the dungeon and kill all the enemys, they probably leave x2 or x3 each enemy (the drop rate is really high).   
Follow the guide, or simply click on the rapid build description, each item I put in can be clicked and redirect to a detailed guide.   
That's my personal views as integration of Eragon in Dark Souls 2.   

  
But if you want a different and also great build follow the next few cosplay I'll do stay tuned.   
I'll start the character today, also it will take few days to end the game and get the final stuff.   
contact me on steam if you need any explanation.   
Bye!
