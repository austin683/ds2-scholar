**Crown of the Old Iron King** is a [Helm](/Helms "Dark Souls 2 Helms") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki").

_"Crown of the Old Iron King who once ruled this land._   
_The King sunk below the scorching iron, met the one whose name must never be repeated, and became Ichorous Earth._   
_But these were events of long ago, and today, no one even remembers the King's name."_

### Location

  * Found on the remains of [Nadalia, Bride of Ash](/Soul+of+Nadalia,+Bride+of+Ash "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Nadalia, Bride of Ash"), past [Fume Knight's](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight") arena.

### Crown of the Old Iron King Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Upgraded physical defenses are only 25% higher.
  * [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") in [Memory of the King](/Memory+of+the+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the King") will react with a new set of dialogues to this and the other two crowns.
  * When worn after receiving [Vendrick's Blessing](/Vendrick's+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick's Blessing"), it will prevent hollowing after death, and completely protect from curse buildup. This effect only works in current playthrough.
  * Every two minutes the Crown is worn, 20% (rounded up) of maximum spell uses will be restored. 
    * "Rounded up" means that, at the very least, the minimum number of spell casts restored will be 1. For example, if you cast a spell that only has 1 cast total, that 1 use will be restored within 2 minutes, despite the helm only restoring 20% of casts.
