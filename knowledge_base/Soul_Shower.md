### Soul Shower Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Shoots a ball of souls overhead that rain down small [Soul Arrows](/Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Soul Arrow"), dealing magic damage. The small souls will then home in on the nearest target, stunning and inflicting low damage. If the ball of souls touches a ceiling, the spell gets canceled. Very useful for setting up other spells in PvP, ie. [Crystal Soul Spear](/Crystal+Soul+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Soul Spear").  
Loses damage and range when spiced down to low intelligence (10-12) (need confirmation)
