**Alonne Captain Set** is an [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") Set in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

>   
> The accoutrements of the Alonne Knights, who served the Old Iron King, were created with an advanced casting technique. Solid and handsomely crafted, their shine remains brilliant to this day.

>   
> The accoutrements of the Alonne Knights, who served the Old Iron King, were created with an advanced crafting technique. They remain solid and handsomely crafted.  
>   
> The design is styled after the armor worn by an unusual knight who trained the Iron King's men in the sword. He was said to have deserted his liege after bearing witness to his descent into depravity.

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Alonne Knight Captains](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain") in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") and [Memory of the Old Iron King](/Memory+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the Old Iron King").

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * There are only 2 Alonne Captain pieces – helm and armor (chestpiece). Gauntlets and Leggings are from the regular [Alonne Knight set](/Alonne+Knight+set "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight set").
  * Armor set has very good poise, and good defense for its weight.
  * Chestpiece offers the highest fire defense among heavy armor sets.
  * Leggings offer second highest physical defenses among armor pieces upgraded with regular Titanite. Other best pieces are: [Gyrm Warrior Greathelm](/Gyrm+Warrior+Set "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior Set") and chestpiece, [Steel](/Steel+Set "Dark Souls 2 Steel Set") / [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper+Set "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper Set") / [Mastodon](/Mastodon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Mastodon Set") gauntlets and Mastodon leggings.
  * Leggings also offer second highest fire defense (almost equal to that of [Black](/Black+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Set") boots, [Black Dragon](/Black+Dragon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Set") leggings, [Bone King](/Bone+King+Set "Dark Souls 2 Bone King Set") and [Saint's](/Saint's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Saint's Set") boots and [Syan's](/Syan's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Syan's Set") leggings).
  * The shoulder armor (pauldron) loosely resembles Nineball from the original Armored Core.
