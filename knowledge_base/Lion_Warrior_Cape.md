**Lion Warrior Cape** is a [Chest Piece](/Chest+Pieces "Dark Souls 2 Chest Pieces") in Dark Souls 2.

_Cape worn by Lion Clan warriors._

_The Lion Clan are an offshoot race that have no ties to humans, and would murder anyone with the curious notion of approaching them._

_The lion clansmen seem to despise their own looks, as they hate being seen._

### Location

  * All pieces seem to have a chance to drop off of any lion warrior in the [Shaded Ruins](/Shaded+Ruins "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Ruins") area, except the helm that only drops off of the [Golden Braided Lion Warrior](/Lion+Clan+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Clan Warrior").

### Lion Warrior Cape Notes

  * Part of the [Lion Warrior Set](/Lion+Warrior+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lion Warrior Set"). 
    * All pieces of this set reduce falling damage (The amount reduced is less than the Silvercat Ring).
    * Pieces effect stacks together, so having the whole set will benefit for more reduced falling damage.
    * All pieces can be acquired in regular NG, though the helm is rare, and is only dropped by the Golden Braided Lion Warrior.
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/upgrades#ore "Dark Souls 2 upgrades#ore").
