**Faraam** is a mentioned-only character in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Faraam was a prominent [god](/Gods+of+Drangleic "Dark Souls 2 Gods of Drangleic") worshipped in the far away land of Forossa. However the land of Forossa fell, and the worshippers of the war god scattered and were left to their own devices.

### Faraam Lore

According to the [head of Vengarl](/Head+of+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Head of Vengarl"), Forossa was a land in the distant east, and when he was born the land was already mired in prolonged conflict with its neighbours. The Forossan Lion Knights were mighty worshippers of the war god Faraam, who wore [heavy armor](/Faraam+Set "Dark Souls 2 Faraam Set") and were feared for their nimble two-handed swordplay. But their legacy was cut short with the fall of the kingdom of Forossa. Though even Forossa's Lion Knights, a motley crew of rabid fighters, kept Vengarl at arm's length. When Forossa fell to war, its citizens were left landless, and entirely to their own devices. Many were reduced to thievery, while Forossan knights were scattered to other lands as sellswords. Forossans venerated the god of war Faraam, and sages who led warriors into battle were called Northwarders. Northwarders earned their title only after completing a great journey of great hardship, after which they would be worshipped as oracles of the war gods. The design on the [shields](/Lion+Clan+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Lion Clan Shield") wielded by the [Lion Clan Warriors](/Lion+Clan+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Clan Warrior") appears to have some religious significance, but we will never know what sort of gods these warriors answer to. At least, not until _Dark Souls 3_ where the bizarre pattern is said to be the mark of a mad god, revered as a god of war in remote regions.
