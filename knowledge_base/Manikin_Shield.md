**Manikin Shield** is a [small shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") used by the manikins of Harvest Valley in DS2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A shield used by the manikins of Harvest Valley._

     _The peculiar art of puppetry is a vestige of the two lost lands.  
The Queen, entranced by poison, used it to beckon unknowing souls to the defiled valley."_

### Acquired From:

  * Dropped from [manikins](/Manikin "Dark Souls 2 Manikin") wielding a shield in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak"). 

### Manikin Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Poor shield for parrying as it features the slow parry animation, despite not having any additional parry frames.
