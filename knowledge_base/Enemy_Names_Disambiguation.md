#  Enemy Names Disambiguation

  
Dark Souls 2 has two "official" sources for enemy names: the "FarFire" names based on official website; and, the FuturePress names based on FuturePress's _Dark Souls II Collector's Edition Guide_. If a FarFire name for an enemy exists on Beyond the Bonfire, this wiki uses that name. If there is no FarFire name for an enemy, this wiki uses the FuturePress name.   
  
The FuturePress guide has enemy descriptions and also organizes enemies by game area; so, it's really clear which enemies their names refer to. The doesn't do either of these things. So, with the FarFire names, we've essentially had to guess which name goes with which enemy. Some are obvious, others not so much. This page represents our best guesses at any given point in time: things may change...

  1. There is a boss of the same name in [No-man's Wharf](/No-man's+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man's Wharf"). FarFire uses the same name for both.
  2. There is a boss of the same name in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep"). FarFire uses the same name for both.
  3. Both FarFire and FuturePress use "Skeleton" to refer to the skeleton in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). This wiki simply uses the one [Skeleton](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") page for _all_ skeletons in the game.
  4. Farfire uses only one name for this enemy, where FuturePress uses two. FuturePress uses "Old Ironclad Soldier" for the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") enemy, "Ironclad Soldier" for the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") one.
  5. There is a boss of the same name in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). FarFire uses the same name for both.
  6. There is a boss of the same name in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). FarFire uses the same name for both.
  7. There is a boss of the same name in [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"). FarFire disambiguates these by calling the boss "Ruin Sentinel Yahim," "Yahim" being one of the names of one of the Sentinels in the boss fight.
  8. Farfire uses only one name for this enemy, where FuturePress uses two. FarFire does disambiguate between the two, using "Undead Devourer (Large)" in reference to the [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") version of the enemy. FuturePress uses "Enslaved Pig" for the [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") enemy, "Undead Pig" for the [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") one.
