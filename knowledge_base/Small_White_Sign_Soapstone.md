**Small White Soapstone** is a [Multiplayer Item](/Multiplayer+Items "Dark Souls 2 Multiplayer Items") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. [Multiplayer Items](/Multiplayer+Items "Dark Souls 2 Multiplayer Items") allow players to interact with each other in various ways, including leaving messages for other players to read, co-operative gameplay and competitive gameplay like PVP.

### Dark Souls 2 Small White Soapstone Usage

  * Creates a summon sign that allows you to enter someone else's game as a shade. This means you can assist players in their world even if their world bosses are dead or if the area has no world boss.
  * Shades have a very limited time in the hosts's world, and their [soul memory](/soul+memory#fex "Dark Souls 2 soul memory#fex") restrictions are different than those of the [White Sign Soapstone](/White+Sign+Soapstone#fex "Dark Souls 2 White Sign Soapstone#fex")

### Small White Soapstone Location in Dark Souls 2

  * At the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"), going up a set of stairs from the [Cardinal Tower](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower") bonfire. The stone is inside a chest in the room with a hole that shows a tree and the bonfire below. (Please Note that there is no need for the Key; you can simply bash open the locked door)

### Dark Souls 2 Small White Soapstone Notes

  * **Not to be confused with[White Sign Soapstone](/White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 White Sign Soapstone")**. If you wish to receive covenant-related items from your coop, such as [Token of Fidelity](/Token+of+Fidelity "Dark Souls 2 Token of Fidelity") or [Sunlight Medal](/Sunlight+Medal "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Medal"), you will want to use that instead.
  * Offers a short duration of play by default, see the table below for exact times. 
  * Each kill, by you or the host, shortens the duration, and tougher enemies typically subtract larger amounts of time. Causing the time to run out is still considered a victory, and the summoned player will be rewarded as such.
  * Killing a red soapstone summon will not decrease your summoning time. Killing a cracked orb invader will decrease your summoning time drastically.
  * White Shades cannot use Estus if there is a red soapstone summon in the world.
  * Can be used to be summoned regardless of if the boss of said area has been destroyed, though you will be sent back if the host goes through the boss fog-gate again.
  * Shortly before running out of time, co-op summons will become darker in appearance. At two minutes remaining they'll appear a bit darker, and at one minute remaining they'll dim down once again to their darkest shade. 
  * The small white soapstone has a summoning range that goes further downwards than the white sign soapstone.
  * If you have planted your sign and the "Your summon sign has disappeared" message appears, means you're going to be invaded by another player.
