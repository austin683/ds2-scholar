**Forest Grotesque (Goblin)** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.   

  

  

_Goblins are humanoid creatures that lurk in the Shaded Woods. These deformed monstrosities give a grotesque impression and do not appear to be products of a natural evolution; rather they seem to have once been human. What twisted force could have rent their humanity and left them in this sad state…?_
