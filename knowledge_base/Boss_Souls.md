**Boss Souls** are special [Items](/Items "Dark Souls 2 Items") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)** that players receive upon defeating certain bosses in the game. These unique souls are distinct from regular consumable souls, as they have specific uses beyond providing souls for leveling up.

### How to use Boss Souls in DS2

In Dark Souls II, boss souls serve multiple purposes. You can either consume them for a substantial amount of souls or trade them with specific NPCs, such as Straid of Olaphis and Weaponsmith Ornifex. When you trade boss souls with these merchants, you can obtain unique boss weapons or spells.

It's advisable to wait until you've encountered both Straid and Ornifex before deciding how to use a particular boss soul. This allows you to assess the available options and choose between acquiring a boss weapon or a spell. Keep in mind that some boss souls can be given to either merchant, while others are exclusive to one of them.

This decision-making process adds a strategic element to the use of boss souls, as players need to consider their character build, preferred weapons, and desired spells when choosing between consuming the soul for souls or trading it for a unique item.

  * Soul Consumption: Like regular souls, boss souls can be consumed to acquire a large number of souls, which can then be used for leveling up, purchasing items, or upgrading equipment.
  * Trade for Weapons and Spells: Many boss souls can be traded with specific NPCs in the game for unique weapons, shields, spells, or other special items. These exchanges are typically done with characters like Straid of Olaphis and Weaponsmith Ornifex.
  * Key Items: Some boss souls may also serve as key items required to unlock specific areas or events in the game. These instances are less common but are important for progressing through certain parts of Dark Souls II.

### How to get Boss Soul Weapons in DS2

**DS2 Boss Soul Weapons** and some [Spells](/Spells "Dark Souls 2 Spells") are acquired through trading. This involves giving an NPC a boss soul and getting a spell or piece of equipment in return, plus a soul fee for creating the spell/weapon. You do not need any of the base weapon types. There are two [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") who can be traded with for boss weapons, and each with their own inventories.

#### [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis")

  * ([The Lost Bastille](/The+Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 The Lost Bastille")) 
    * Requires 3 INT for him to trade with you
    * Trades boss souls for both spells and weapons, also sells some very useful spells without trading boss souls.

  1. Locate Straid in his cell in Lost Bastille (located above the stairs past the gate to Sinners' Rise).
  2. Unpetrify him using a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") after clearing out all the enemies surrounding him.
  3. Assuming that your Intelligence is at least a 3, you may now trade with him.
  4. If you trade at least 4 boss souls, talk to him and he will give you the Black Set (the staff he uses can only be obtained in Dragon Shrine at the cost of a [Pharros Lockstone](/Pharros+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros Lockstone"), an incredibly low price for any sorcerer with 50+ INT).

#### [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex")([Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"))

  * Trades boss souls for weapons.
  * Blacksmith, but does not have the ability to imbue.

  1. Near the [Shaded Ruins bonfire](/Shaded+Ruins "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Ruins") there's a single petrified Lion Clan Warrior just across the tree bridge. Unpetrify and kill him to get the [Fang Key](/Fang+Key "Dark Souls 2 Fang Key").
  2. To the right of the [Giant Basilisk](/Great+Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Great Basilisk"), there are some wooden planks on the ground. If you walk on these planks, they will break and you will fall into a pit with 4 regular Basilisks that ambush you. These basilisks will petrify you quickly if not expected. Fight them or run further into the cave (if you do decide to run through the cave, avoid the puddles as they will corrode your equipment). Once the basilisks have been killed, you will find a locked wooden door. Use the Fang Key to unlock it and talk to Ornifex to trigger her relocation.
  3. Ornifex will leave and go to a room full of dolls near the [third bonfire](/Lower+Brightstone+Cove "Dark Souls 2 Lower Brightstone Cove") in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). She'll grant you a free trade (boss weapons only) of your choice (standard pricing is not shown when trading the first time)
