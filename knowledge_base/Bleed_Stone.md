**Bleed Stone** is a type of [Upgrade Material](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Bleed Stone** , a transformed variant of titanite. Employ it to confer a lacerating effect on weapons or bolster bleeding resistance in shields. While this significantly diminishes the weapon's Strength/Dexterity scaling and slightly reduces its base damage, it introduces Bleed and heightens bleeding resistance on shields. Exclusive use at Blacksmith [Steady Hand McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff"). [Upgrade Materials](/Upgrades "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades") are items that are used to strengthen the statistical value and to increase the effect of a certain piece of equipment.

> An altered state of titanite. Use to make weapons lacerating, or to provide bleeding resistance to shields.   
> Sorcerers at the Melfian Magic Academy once attempted to imbue titanite with various elements, but are said to have failed. Someone must have succeeded though; what else would explain this stone?

### Bleed Stone Usage in DKS2

    * Can only be used at Blacksmith [Steady Hand McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff")
    * Used to imbue equipment with bleeding. This greatly reduces the weapon's Strength/Dexterity scaling and slightly reduces its base damage, but adds Bleed and increases bleeding resistance on shields.
    * If Bleed is infused onto a weapon that naturally has Bleed then it increases the weapon's base Bleed by 43%, increases Bleed scaling from Dexterity/Faith by 82%, and increases the bonus granted by [Shadow Gauntlets](/Shadow+Set "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Set") and [Crest of Blood](/Crest+of+Blood "Dark Souls 2 Crest of Blood") by 20% (+60 Bleed each instead of +50)

  * Note that infusing a weapon with Bleed will cause it to be unable to be coated in [Bleeding Serum](/Bleeding+Serum "Dark Souls 2 Bleeding Serum"), but may still be coated/enchanted via other means.
  * Some weapons with innate bleeding ability are naturally unable to be coated in Bleeding Serum, such as the [Royal Greatsword](/Royal+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Royal Greatsword"), [Flamberge](/Flamberge "Dark Souls 2 Flamberge"), and [Full Moon Sickle](/Full+Moon+Sickle "Dark Souls 2 Full Moon Sickle"), making Bleed infusion more valuable as you aren't giving up that ability.
  * Only bladed weapons and whips may be infused with Bleed. Ranged weapons and blunt weapons (including the [Morning Star](/Morning+Star "Dark Souls 2 Morning Star")) cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * A notable exception is the [Notched Whip](/Notched+Whip "Dark Souls 2 Notched Whip"), which may not be infused or coated/enchanted via any means, likely to balance out its extremely high base bleed rating.
