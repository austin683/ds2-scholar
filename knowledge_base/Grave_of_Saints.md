## **Grave of Saints**

  
**Grave of Saints** is a [Location](/Locations "Dark Souls 2 Locations") in **Dark Souls 2**. Accessed via the pit in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), this rat-infested area is home to the [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant") and its members can pull you into their world as a grey phantom. They will do their best to inflict Toxic damage and lure you in, using many [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") contraptions to hinder you. The rats can petrify you if you let them attack you enough.

Note: This area can be skipped by use of the [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") and enough health, if one makes it all the way to the bottom of [The Pit in Majula](/The+Pit "Dark Souls 2 The Pit"), or by paying laddersmith Gilligan 12,000 souls to build the largest ladder to get to the bottom of the pit.

### Grave of Saints Walkthrough

### Start to Rhoy Invasion

After coming into the area from [The Pit in Majula](/The+Pit "Dark Souls 2 The Pit"), the first bonfire, [Harval's Resting Place](/Harval%27s+Resting+Place "Dark Souls 2 Harval%27s Resting Place") will be an obvious find. On your way in, two [Hollow Prisoner](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") will sit around, get rid of them so they dont join your fights against [Corpse Rat](/Corpse+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Corpse Rat")s later on. After dealing with them, enter the large chamber, which has a dry fountain in the middle due to a hole in the base. There is treasure and a very interesting looking skeleton in the fountain but you can't access this area yet. More importantly, upon entering, several [Corpse Rats](/Corpse+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Corpse Rat") will sneak out of small holes around the room and attack. Individually they should pose no threat, however, groups can be dangerous, because their attacs build up petrification. Inside this chamber is a skeleton with a [ Large Soul of a Nameless Solider](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier").

Continue into the lightend-up area and up a small stairs, then take care of more [Rats](/Corpse+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Corpse Rat") coming from the right. This way brings us further down the progress path, so we ignore that direction for now and go left instead. This way leads to another snickering [Hollow Prisoner](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner"), as well as a corpse, holding 3x [Small Smooth & Silky Stones](/Small+Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth & Silky Stone"). Back at the junction, you will notice a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") face on the floor, which opens a bridge right next to it. This is about the only worthwhile Contraption, if you have no interest in joining the [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant"). Activate it and cross the bridge to arrive at a large room filled with petrified rats. There is a corpse with 2x [Poison Moss](/Poison+Moss "Dark Souls 2 Poison Moss") up ahead, but be carefull, as 3 more [Rats](/Corpse+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Corpse Rat") will crawl out from the opening left of the corpse. After taking care of them and taking the Moss, go up a set of stairs, leading to a skeleton holding [Whisper of Despair](/Whisper+of+Despair "Dark Souls 2 Whisper of Despair") and a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch").

Further down the way leads to a doorway, blocked with a bridge like the one you just crossed that can be lowered with another [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") on the floor above. However, we recommend against wasting a lockstone here, as you will be reaching the area across later. Heading back to the hall where you lowered the bridge and take the way we ignored before. On your way down, you will come to a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") face in the wall and a ladder. This one creates a waterfall that obscures vision and extinguishes torches and is intended to help [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant") members, as are the majority of Lockstones in this area.

### Rhoy to Royal Rat Boss

Heading up the ladder will trigger the scripted invasion of [Rhoy the Explorer](/Rhoy+the+Explorer "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy the Explorer") (Only if you play offline). Here's what you need to know:

  * He is relatively fast but is not a tremendous threat on his own; allowing rats to join the fray does cause problems as they will fall and crawl to sneak up on you.
  * He drops a random piece of equipment when killed: 
    * [Shotel](/Shotel "Dark Souls 2 Shotel") +5
    * [Armor of Aurous](/Armor+of+Aurous "Dark Souls 2 Armor of Aurous") [Warmth](/Warmth "Dark Souls 2 Warmth") (pyromancy)
    * Heavy Crossbow +5

After defeating him and the three [Rats](/Corpse+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Corpse Rat") coming from the left, you can inspect this new section, which mostly looks like the floor below but with several [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") holes. The one in the floor right away lowers the bridge mentioned earlier, but as with most of the Contraptions here, it only is usefull for Members of the [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant"), or for dealing with them (having more ways you can go). Moving to the left leads to a tomb with 3 more [Rats](/Corpse+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Corpse Rat") and a skeleton holding 3x [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"). Other lockstones will create acid pools (at the areas with the statues of rats holding jars) that damage armor; these are more traps to help covenant members.   
  
Heading in the other direction leads to a the [Grave Entrance bonfire](/Grave+Entrance "Dark Souls 2 Grave Entrance") and mist door, while the door leads to the boss fight.

BOSS FIGHT: [Royal Rat Vanguard](/Royal+Rat+Vanguard "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Vanguard")

When you first enter the boss fight, you will be swarmed by regular rats. Killing a number of them will trigger the [Vanguard](/Royal+Rat+Vanguard "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Vanguard")'s entry. While it is not easily distinguishable, look for a rat with bigger ears and a mohawk. Once you've spotted the [Vanguard](/Royal+Rat+Vanguard "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Vanguard"), kill it to cease the continuous attack of rats. 

### Rat King and Coffin Ladder

After defeating the boss, the room leads to a door and [The Rat King](/Rat+King "Dark Souls 2 Rat King") will respect the murdering of his [Vanguard](/Royal+Rat+Vanguard "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Vanguard"), allowing you to join the [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant"). You are given the ring [Crest of the Rat](/Crest+of+the+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Crest of the Rat"). If you have entered the covenant the area rats and hollows will no longer attack you as you are now one of them.

A hole in the floor after [The Rat King](/Rat+King "Dark Souls 2 Rat King") drops down to the center fountain which was inaccessible before. Take a look at the very interesting skeleton before you do; while it's essentially useless, it's still a nice touch. Below is a corpse with a [Pharros' lockstone](/Pharros%27+lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 lockstone"). The only way out is down which leads to a pit with coffins jutting out as ledges to jump down. This leads to a stone bridge above a broken wooden one.

### Wooden Bridge to The Gutter

If you're quick enough, the broken wooden bridge holds a [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal lizard"). Note that there's a separate access to [The Gutter](/the+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 the Gutter") area from [The Pit in Majula](/The+Pit "Dark Souls 2 The Pit"), and the [Crystal Lizard](/crystal+lizard "Dark Souls 2 crystal lizard") is fairly easy to get from this entry. The skeleton on the bridge also holds a [Bleed Stone](/Bleed+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Bleed Stone"). You can jump from the bridge to a small ledge with a corpse yields the [Disc Chime](/Disc+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Disc Chime"). Alternately, drop down to the wooden bridge below. On one end of the wooden bridge past the gap is a chest containing [Ash Knuckle Ring. ](/Ash+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Ash Knuckle Ring") Get a good running start and jump over.

_Note: The stairway on the other end of the bridge leads back to an entrance ledge in[The Pit in Majula](/The+Pit "Dark Souls 2 The Pit"). The [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard") will spawn on the stairs just before the bridge. It will run across the bridge and fall through the hole, so make sure to kill it quickly. _

__

Jumping down from either the [Disc Chime](/Disc+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Disc Chime") ledge or the wooden bridge, will land you in a water pit. Get out of water as it slows your movement, not the movement of the 3 exploding [Rupturing Hollows](/Rupturing+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Rupturing Hollow") that are coming from one tunnel though. Another thing to note is if you hang out on the wooden bridge for a while, before jumping down, [Rupturing Hollows](/Rupturing+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Rupturing Hollow") will come out for you to snipe. One tunnel has water (NG+ there will be 2x Phantoms in the water tunnel, 1x Lightning Mage, 2x Knight) and the other does not. The one with water has a [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier") guarding a chest that contains a [Sublime Bone Dust](/Sublime+Bone+Dust "Dark Souls 2 Sublime Bone Dust").

The other tunnel (where the [Rupturing Hollows](/Rupturing+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Rupturing Hollow") came from) has a ladder and scaffolding further down. After the first drop...you're down there. You can't reach the ladder again. There are two choices down. When facing the pit, a ladder to the right leads to another ladder and a corpse with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy").

The other direction leads to ladders down, passing a corpse with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"), near the bottom. Make sure to find this, as there is then another ladder with no way back up. A chest at the base holds a [Token of Spite](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite").

A tunnel here leads out to [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"). Bring torches.

  * The tunnel with water, opposite the one with [Great Heal](/Great+Heal "Dark Souls 2 Great Heal"), will contain 2x **Phantoms** , 1x **Lightning Mage** , and 2x **Knights** , in NG+

### Grave of Saints Walkthrough

### Start to Rhoy Invasion

After coming into the area from [The Pit in Majula](/The+Pit "Dark Souls 2 The Pit"), the first bonfire, [Harval's Resting Place](/Harval%27s+Resting+Place "Dark Souls 2 Harval%27s Resting Place") will be an obvious find. A [Hollow](/abandoned+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 abandoned Hollow") stands by the entrance to a large chamber. Kill him before he sneaks up on you. The large chamber has a dry fountain in the middle due to a hole in the base. There is treasure and a very interesting looking skeleton in the fountain but you can't access this area yet. More importantly, upon entering, several Rats will sneak out of small holes around the room and attack. Individually they should pose no threat, however, groups can be dangerous and cause poisoning. Inside this chamber is a skeleton with a [Large Soul of a Nameless Solider](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier").

Exiting via a small stair leads up to a hall area where you can immediately identify a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") face on the floor, which opens a bridge right next to it. This is about the only worthwhile Contraption, if you have no interest in joining the **Rat Covenant**. Activate it and cross the bridge to arrive at a large room with filled with petrified rats, and a small group of live ones crawl out. There is a corpse with 2x [Poison Moss](/Poison+Moss "Dark Souls 2 Poison Moss"), a set of stairs up, and a skeleton with [Whisper of Despair](/Whisper+of+Despair "Dark Souls 2 Whisper of Despair") and a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch").

This ends with a door, blocked with a bridge like the one you just crossed that can be lowered with another [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") on the floor above. However, we recommend against wasting a lockstone here, as you will be reaching the area across later. Heading back to the hall where you lowered the bridge, the right hand side (left hand from the stairs) ends with a [Abandoned Hollow](/Abandoned+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Abandoned Hollow") just hanging about, and a corpse with holding a whopping 3x [Small Smooth & Silky Stone](/Small+Smooth+%26+Silky+stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth %26 Silky stone"). Heading in the other direction, you will come to a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") face in the wall and a ladder. This one creates a waterfall that obscures vision and extinguishes torches and is intended to help [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant") members, as are the majority of Lockstones in this area.

### Rhoy to Royal Rat Boss

Heading up the ladder will trigger the scripted invasion of [Rhoy the Explorer](/Rhoy+the+Explorer "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy the Explorer"). Here's what you need to know:

  * He is relatively fast but is not a tremendous threat on his own; allowing rats to join the fray does cause problems as they will fall and crawl to sneak up on you.
  * He drops a random piece of equipment when killed: 
    * [Shotel](/Shotel "Dark Souls 2 Shotel") +5
    * [Armor of Aurous](/Armor+of+Aurous "Dark Souls 2 Armor of Aurous") [Warmth](/Warmth "Dark Souls 2 Warmth") (pyromancy)
    * Heavy Crossbow +5
  * You need to play offline for [Rhoy the Explorer](/Rhoy+the+Explorer "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy the Explorer") to invade you, otherwise you won't get invaded.

### The Rat King

After defeating Roy, you can inspect this new section, which mostly looks like the floor below but with several [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") holes. The one in the floor right away lowers the bridge mentioned earlier -I wouldn't use it. Moving to the left leads to a tomb with a giant skeleton. A smaller skeleton in this area holds 3x [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"). Other lockstones will create acid pools that damage armor; these are more traps to help covenant members. Heading to the other direction leads to a the [Grave Entrance bonfire](/Grave+Entrance "Dark Souls 2 Grave Entrance") and mist door, while the door leads to the boss fight.

From the bonfire, there is also a direct passage to the boss fog.

BOSS FIGHT: [Royal Rat Vanguard](/Royal+Rat+Vanguard "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Vanguard")

### Getting to the Wooden Bridge

After defeating the boss the room leads to a door and [The Rat King](/Rat+King "Dark Souls 2 Rat King") who will respect the murdering of his Vanguard and allows you to join the [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant"). You are given the ring [Crest of the Rat](/Crest+of+the+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Crest of the Rat"). If you have entered the covenant the area rats and hollows will no longer attack you as you are now one of them.

A hole in the floor after [The Rat King](/Rat+King "Dark Souls 2 Rat King") drops down to the center fountain which was inaccessible before. Take a look at the very interesting skeleton before you do. There's nothing that happens but it's a nice touch. Below is a corpse with a [Pharros' lockstone](/Pharros%27+lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 lockstone"). The only way out is down which leads to a pit with coffins jutting out as ledges to jump down. This leads to a stone bridge above a broken wooden one.

### Heading to The Gutter

If you're quick enough, the broken wooden bridge holds a [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal lizard"). Note that there's a separate access to [The Gutter](/the+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 the Gutter") area from [The Pit in Majula](/The+Pit "Dark Souls 2 The Pit"), and the [Crystal Lizard](/crystal+lizard "Dark Souls 2 crystal lizard") is fairly easy to get from this entry. The skeleton on the bridge also holds a [Bleed Stone](/Bleed+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Bleed Stone"). You can jump from the bridge to a small ledge with a corpse yields the [Disc Chime](/Disc+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Disc Chime"). Alternately, drop down to the wooden bridge below. On one end of the wooden bridge past the gap is a chest containing [Ash Knuckle Ring. ](/Ash+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Ash Knuckle Ring") Get a good running start and jump over.

_Note: The stairway on the other end of the bridge leads back to an entrance ledge in[The Pit in Majula](/The+Pit "Dark Souls 2 The Pit"). Another [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard") will also spawn on the stairs just before the bridge. It will run across the bridge and fall through the hole, so make sure to kill it quickly. _

Jumping down from either the [Disc Chime](/Disc+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Disc Chime") ledge or the wooden bridge, will land you in a water pit. Get out of water as it slows your movement and six exploding [Rupturing Hollows](/Rupturing+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Rupturing Hollow") are waiting in the two tunnels to the sides. Another thing to note is if you hang out on the wooden bridge for a while, before jumping down, [Rupturing Hollows](/Rupturing+Hollow "Dark Souls 2 Rupturing Hollow") will come out for you to snipe. One tunnel has water and the other does not. The one with water contains a [Skeleton](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") with [Great Heal](/Great+Heal "Dark Souls 2 Great Heal").

The other tunnel has a ladder and scaffolding further down. After the first drop...you're down there. You can't reach the ladder again. There are two choices down. When facing the ladder, a ladder to the left leads to another ladder and a corpse with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy").

The other direction leads to ladders down, passing a corpse with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"), near the bottom. Make sure to find this, as there is then another ladder with no way back up. A chest at the base holds a [Token of Spite](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite").

A tunnel here leads out to [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"). Bring torches.
