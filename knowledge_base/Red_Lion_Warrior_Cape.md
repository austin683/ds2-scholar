**Red Lion Warrior Cape** is a [Chest Piece](/Chest+Pieces "Dark Souls 2 Chest Pieces") in Dark Souls 2.

_"Red cape worn by Lion Clan warriors._

_The Lion Clan are an offshoot race that have no ties to humans, and would murder anyone with the curious notion of approaching them._

_The lion clansmen seem to despise their own looks, as they hate being seen."_

### Location

  * Dropped by Golden-maned [Lion Clan Warrior](/Lion+Clan+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Clan Warrior") found in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"), below the arena with [Manscorpion Tark](/Manscorpion+Tark "Dark Souls 2 Manscorpion Tark"). That lion spawns only once and the cape is a rare drop. 
    * [Scholar of the First Sin] That lion is moved to ruins straight on the path from bonfire.

### Red Lion Warrior Cape Notes

  * Upgraded from [Titanite](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard").
  * Part of the [Lion Warrior Set](/Lion+Warrior+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lion Warrior Set").
  * Offers second highest curse resistance (equal to that of [Retainer's Robe](/Retainer's+Robe "Dark Souls 2 Retainer's Robe")).
  * Reduces falling damage.
