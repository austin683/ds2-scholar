**Spirit Tree Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A shield with a blue relief of a spirit tree. A rather well-built shield decorated  
by the spirit tree that appears in the allegory of Quella, god of dream._

     _Has a faint residue of magic, and can deflect spells by parrying."_

### DKS2 Spirit Tree Shield Acquired From:

  * Reach rank 1 in the [Blue Sentinels Covenant](/Blue+Sentinels "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinels").
  * From [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") in NG++.

### Spirit Tree Shield Hints and Tips in Dark Souls 2:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Will deflect spells with correct parry timing. The Parry timing when deflecting spells is much larger compared to parrying melee attacks.
  * Not to be confused with the [ Grand Spirit Tree Shield](/Grand+Spirit+Tree+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Grand Spirit Tree Shield").
  * Also wielded by the [Black Drakeblood Knights](/Black+Drakeblood+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Black Drakeblood Knight").
  * This shield reappears in _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Spirit Tree Crest Shield](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Tree+Crest+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Spirit Tree Crest Shield").
