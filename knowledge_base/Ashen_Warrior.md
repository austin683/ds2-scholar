### Ashen Warrior Information in Dark Souls 2

_The Ashen Warriors' loyalty to one another is the stuff of legends, and they held fast in their positions even as the once-great Iron Keep sank into the fiery earth.  
The blades they wield were forged by one of the true artisans entertained by the Iron King during his kingdom's heyday_

Standing only a couple feet over the player, the Ashen Warriors are hollowed soldiers that roam Brume Tower and attack any intruders on sight. They can hide beneath the ashen ground in some places, and even in the sides of mountains, ambushing the player as they walk by. There are a few variants of the Ashen Warriors:

Battle Axe Wielders use dual battle axes and will attack mercilessly, leaping towards the player to close the gap between them.

Halberd Wielders use a single halberd and a shield, taking a more defensive approach to attack the player. They are able to attack with their shield raised, and have a dangerous spinning attack. They can be guard broken.

Sword Wielders use a single Ashen Warrior Sword and may sometimes be equipped with a bow that they will use at range. Their most dangerous attack is when they swing their sword four times in quick succession, potentially poise-breaking the player and dealing heavy damage.
