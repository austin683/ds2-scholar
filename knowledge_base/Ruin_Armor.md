_"Armor worn by the jailer's creation, the Ruin Sentinel._

_The sentinel has no form, its soul residing within the armor itself. Stare at it for long and it seems ready to spring to life, but surely, such is an illusion._ "

### Location

  * Drops from [Ruin Sentinels](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"). 
    * Recommend farming this set on your 1st play through, because on ng+ and higher the ruin sentinels only spawn once, were on ng they spawn 15-10 times.
  * Very rare for sentinels to drop the armor (especially chest piece) so its best to wear [Jester's Cap](/Jester's+Cap "Dark Souls 2 Jester's Cap"), [Prisoner's Tatters](/Prisoner's+Tatters "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner's Tatters"), [Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring"), and use [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin").

### Notes

  * Part of the [Ruin Set](/Ruin+Set "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Set").
  * Upgraded from [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
