An abandoned house located in the coastal hub area of [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), not a separate area itself.

## Map of Drangleic

  
This house features a map of Drangleic carved into the floor of a large room with bonfires that burn in locations representing the main boss bonfires and where they have been defeated.   
When 8 [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") have been burnt, the flame for that bonfire now burns blue instead of red. This is purely visual; nothing happens if all the fires have been turned blue.

  * NG level doesn't count towards the blue fire, only if 8 Ascetics were burnt.
  * Reskinned weapons can also be found on the chest when there is an official [Event](/Events "Dark Souls 2 Events").
