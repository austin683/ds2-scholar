### Gyrm Warrior Gloves Description

_"Warrior gloves of the nomadic Gyrm. Excellent poise and defense, but very heavy._  
_Most Gyrm descendants refuse contact with outsiders, and live with a sense of deep contempt for those who exiled them"_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Dropped by Gyrm warriors in [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros).

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Ores), this makes Gyrm Warrior Greatheim & Armor with Mastodon Gloves + Boots a much more considerable choice than [Havel's Set](/Havel%27s+Set), until you managed to collect 60 Twinkling Titanite.
  * extremely high physical defense, it outclassed [Ironclad Set](/Ironclad+Set) for the physical defense stat and lighter than it, this armor is, however, vulnerable to backstabbing.
