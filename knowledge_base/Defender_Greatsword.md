###  DS2 Defender Greatsword Hints and Tips

  * Reinforced with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5.
  * Pressing L2 while two-handing will cast a [Sunlight Blade](/Sunlight+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Blade")-style buff consuming 10 durability. The buff lasts 45 seconds and is not affected by the Lingering[ Dragoncrest Ring](/Lingering+Dragoncrest+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Lingering Dragoncrest Ring") Or Northwarders set.
  * This is an excellent sword for a Faith build. Infuse with lightning, and once fully upgraded, it can deal over 300 lightning damage at 50 Faith. That's not including the 200-300 physical damage.
  * Its self buff follows the same formula as sunlight blade when enchanting an innate elemental weapon.
