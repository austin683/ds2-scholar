### Benhart of Jugo Information in Dark Souls 2

  * NPC holding a [BlueMoon Greatsword](/BlueMoon+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 BlueMoon Greatsword") (Not to be confused with the real [Moonlight Greatsword](/Moonlight+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Moonlight Greatsword")) in the path between [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") and the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"). When you rescue [Rosabeth of Melfia](/Rosabeth+of+Melfia "Dark Souls 2 Rosabeth of Melfia"), he will thank you and become available for summons.
  * Teaches you the [gesture Joy](/Gestures "Dark Souls 2 Gestures")
  * Proud of his sword, a family heirloom, Benhart is convinced it has a powerful magic only a true swordsman can unlock. Unfortunately, it is a fake. [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") will confirm this if you take the blade to him. 
    * Regrettably, there is no additional dialogue or acknowledgment from Benhart if the player talks to him with the true Moonlight Greatsword.
  * Upon slaying Benhart, [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") will sell his armor.
  * If you summon Benhart for at least 3 of the boss fights that he can be summoned for, and he stays alive until the boss is defeated, afterwards while speaking to him in the [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Orro") will award you with the following: 
    * Moonlight Greatsword achievement
    * [Bluemoon Greatsword](/BlueMoon+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 BlueMoon Greatsword")
    * [Benhart's Parma](/Benhart%27s+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Benhart%27s Parma")
    * [Benhart's Set](/Benhart%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Benhart%27s Set"). 
      * Note: The bosses do not have to be different ones, as a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") can be used to respawn the same boss repeatedly. 
      * Note: Using the [bonfire ascetic](/bonfire+ascetic "Dark Souls 2 bonfire ascetic") trick mentioned above makes it possible to get his equipment as early as [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"), by exhausting his dialog when he is sitting next to the central castle bonfire.

### Benhart of Jugo Encounters in Dark Souls 2

  * [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). Sitting near entrance to [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"), waiting for someone to clear the path.
  * [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"). Sitting near Central Castle bonfire.
  * [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). Sitting in front of fallen giant past the Pursuer's boss arena.
  * [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Orro"). Sitting in front of player's spawn, next to the stairs.

### Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo Summon Locations

  * [Brightstone Cove Tseldora.](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") In a tent near the collapsed building containing the mimic at the Royal Army Campsite Bonfire. Assists with [Prowling Magus](/Prowling+Magus "Dark Souls 2 Prowling Magus") boss fight.
  * [King's Passage](/King's+Passage "Dark Souls 2 King's Passage"). To the left of the fog gate for [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Knight"), who he can assist with.
  * [Memory of Jeigh](/Memory+of+Jeigh "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Jeigh"). Directly ahead of the player's spawn point, down the steps leading to the shattered archway. Will only appear after the player has exhausted his dialogue in [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Orro").
  * [Dragon's Rest](/Dragon's+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Dragon's Rest"). Near the fog gate to [Elana, Squalid Queen](/Elana,+Squalid+Queen "Dark Souls 2 Elana, Squalid Queen"). Benhart's survival in this fight **will** count towards the 3 fights he must survive in order to complete his questline/trophy. His summon sign is located towards the back of the room.
  * [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Throne of Want"). Next to the fog gate, where he can assist with all three back-to-back final boss fights. [Throne Watcher and Throne Defender](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher and Throne Defender") does NOT count for his quest, but the [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") fight DOES. Getting [Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo "Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo") to survive through multiple fights can be tough, so if one wants to use [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") for the quest, then it is recommended to complete the TWD fight before fighting [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") herself. Alternatively one can abort the linked fights after TWD in any way (homeward bone, aged feather, dying) and walk back to the fog gate for a full HP summon for [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra").

### Benhart of Jugo Dialogue

**\- When first encountered in the entrance to Shaded Woods**

  1. Have you business with me?  
The way yonder's all blocked up you see. By this god-awful statue.  
Heavens above. Who thought it a good idea to put it there!
  2. Ohhhh, I'm in quite the pickle now.  
See that statue? Gives me the willies. Stare at it for long enough, it starts to look alive.  
Ach, It just does nae seem quite right. There are no craftsmen round these parts.  
Hey, you don't think a real-life person was turned to stone, do you?

**\- Talk after clearing the path to Shaded Woods**

Haah, didn't think you had it in yer pal.  
No no no. That's not like it sounds, you know! It was a pleasant surprise, that's all.  
Name's Benhart. Thanks to you, I can resume my journey.  
If we share the same path, I'm sure that we are gonna meet again.  
I'll repay my debt to you in battle. And I swear it by my sword.  
The road ahead's gonna be long, but I'm here to help. Gah hah hah hah hah!

Legend has it that powerful beings slumber in this land.  
This sword, it's been in my family for generations. And only a real man can wield it true.  
I may face any manner of man or beast, but none shall be a match for my sword. Heh heh heh heh…
  3. This land is a right mess, eh?

Ah, it's been in my family for generations.  
They say it is crafted with moonlight, and we all know what that means, it wards off evil.  
And I would nae trade her for all the riches in the world.  
They say that no man has ever teased oot the sword's true power.  
But in the right hands…Heh heh heh heh heh heh…
  3. I see you've taken a liking to the sword. Well, I applaud you, for you've a sharp eye.

What's done…urgh… Is done…

### Dark Souls 2 Benhart of Jugo Trivia

  * The easiest method of obtaining his gear/achievement is widely debated, so multiple methods are mentioned here.
  * Summoning Benhart in [Memory of Jeigh](/Memory+of+Jeigh "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Jeigh") to fight the [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord") after talking with him in Memory of Orro is perhaps the easiest method to get his gear. To reset and allow another summon in Memory of Jeigh, use an ascetic on The Place Unbeknownst bonfire after killing the Giant Lord on the current intensity. The main issue with this method is that Benhart (and most NPC phantoms for that matter) tends to be incredibly stupid when trying to make him survive a fight (Lucatiel on ng+ Sinner...) , which is problematic in the Memory of Jeigh because of the constant fireballs, rolling statue head, and the damage the Giant Lord inflicts with his skyscraper-esque sword, but if Benhart survives to the end, it is undoubtedly the fastest method.
  * Dying can be used to reset the encounter should Benhart die before you are able to kill the boss. The [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"), [Homeward Miracle](/Homeward "Dark Souls 2 Homeward"), and the [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") can all be used to reset the encounter should Benhart die. Returning you to your last visited bonfire in the process.
  * Alternatively, you can also use Bonfire Ascetics to reset the [Prowling Magus and the Congregation](/Prowling+Magus+and+Congregation "Dark Souls 2 Prowling Magus and Congregation") boss fight three times to get the items. This is an easy fight where it is unlikely either you or Benhart will die. There is a bit of a distance between the boss and Benhart's summon sign, so the walking back and forth is the longest part. It is also advisable you clear out all the enemies leading from his sign to the boss fight before you summon him, just to be safe. Unfortunately, AI stupidity also comes into play here, as Benhart seems apt to fall off the ledge where the boulders come down, making this method, while easy if done well, incredibly annoying to watch your achievement walk off a ledge multiple times.
  * Bonfire Ascetics can also be used to fight the [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Knight") multiple times. Be sure to equip the [Red Eye Ring](/Redeye+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Redeye Ring") as the Looking Glass Knight will focus Benhart when he gets low health.
  * As with any NPC phantom, any combination of these methods will result in the desired effect, it just depends on what you believe to be the fight both you and Benhart can survive consistently with increasing difficulty. So long as you and Benhart complete 3 of any of these fights (or 2 of one and 1 of another, etc.) and he survives each, he will reward you with his gear and achievement if spoken to in the area behind the Pursuer fight.
