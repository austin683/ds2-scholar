####  **Attribute notes:**

Original: Vigor could be lowered to 40 (or even lower) if you don't mind being more squishy so that you can pump up STR and/or DEX for more weapon variety or for a specific weapon.   
Twinked: This is designed around a specific weapon and adds agility which is definitely worth it.

*Requires 20 strength   
  

####  **Armor Notes:**

Obviously everything should be upgraded as much as possible. The King's Crown is important because it provides +3 to both INT and FTH to reach 30/30 which is the soft cap for Dark BNS. The Black Witch Robe fully upgraded has the best elemental resistances of any piece of equipment in the game, is very light to allow weight to be used elsewhere, and is #FASHIONSOULS as hell dawg, also inspired the build name because this "robe" is a lady's ballgown. Havel's needs 20 strength, if you don't have that just use your next best heavy arms and legs for poise and physical resistances, Looking Glass Knight's set is a good option for 16 STR.   
  
For the twinked version I prefer Hexer's Hood simply because more casts is too useful to pass up even though I think it is damn fugly. Also if you prefer a longer roll then switch to lighter legs and gloves and you will need to unequip the Silverblack Sickle or equip Soldier's Ring to get <30% for the longest roll since I dumped some Vitality in this version of the build. Weapon options are very limited and I really only use the Sickle against extreme turtles, most of the time I just use Drakekeeper Sword. A Dark infused and buffed Dagger can do very large critical damage so feel free to keep one handy.   
  
  

####  **Weapon Notes:**

I love the movesets for both of the melee weapons. The Drakekeeper Sword is very fast, especially the 1-handed R1 while running. The Silverblack Sickle may be classified as a Reaper, but it actually has the moveset of an Axe, which is medium in speed, features fast rolling attacks and good horizontal strikes. The main perk of this weapon is shield piercing strong attacks that decimate turtles with ease. The Chimes/Staffs are all optional but the ones I have here are the most powerful available to this build. The Bat Staff you should only use for Dark Fog and yes instant poison is cheap as hell. If it aint broke don't fix it, and if it is broke abuse it until they fix it...   
  
Other Preferred Weapons-   
  

  * Moonlight Greatsword - not as useful since the nerf, but still useful
  * Dark Claymore - Claymore is my PVE weapon of choice, also great in PVP
  * Dark Roaring Halberd - I'm not a huge fan of Halberd's but this a a fine option if you are into them
  * Dark Scythe of Nahr Alma - not a great option but it's there
  * Dark Scythe of Want - a better option if you want a scythe, has a unique 2-handed R2 that can do heavy damage
  * Dark Uchigatana/ any other katana - if you have the needed DEX, great PVP weapons
  * Poison Manslayer - needs 18 DEX, if you can wield this you can poison things with ease, never bad to have around
  * Dark or Bleed Falchion(x2) - Can be dual-wielded and used in power-stance at 20 DEX, great power-stance moveset and very useful in PVE
  * Dark Dagger - Massive criticals, not much use other than that

  
  

####  **Ring Notes:**

The first three rings are pretty much mandatory for this build. For the optional slot- Chloranthy is generally useful in PVP only as it is not hard to take an extra second for stamina regen in most PVE scenarios. Abyss Seal makes you take damage with every Hex cast, but adds 20% damage which can be simply devastating and is well worth it most of the time. Old Leo Ring is a great melee buff in the right hands. Take whatever you like for the situation at hand.   
  

###  _**Spells**_

First things first you should grind spices to get key spells down to no more than 30/30 INT/FTH requirements.   
  

####  **Hexes**

**Profound Still -** A PVPer's best friend. Don't be surprised if you get called many unsavory things for opening fights with this. The maximum range appears to be just outside of lock-on range, don't waste it if they are much further away than that.   
**Resonant Weapon/Dark Weapon -** Resonant if you don't mind losing 1 more slot for additional melee power, otherwise Dark works almost as well.   
**Dark Orb** \- Many casts, great for harassing opponents and testing lag, if there is a lot of lag they will never see this coming in time to dodge it. Damage is quite good with this build at around 600 per hit with the Dark Sunset Staff +10.   
**Great Resonant Soul -** # _360NOSCOPEHEADSHOT!_ With the Abyss Seal equipped I cannot recall the number of single hit deaths this spell has caused. Fantastic for punishing and should be spammed at will if there is a lot of lag.   
**Resonant Flesh -** 20% HP buff for 60 seconds, combined with Life Ring +2 this can make you one hell of a tank @ 40+ vigor   
**Darkstorm -** I'm not a huge fan of AOE's in this game but this one is pretty good   
**Dark Fog -** Use with Bat Staff = instant poison   
  

####  **Pyromancies**

Take your pick, there is nary a bad spell in the bunch.   
  

####  **Miracles**

**Great Heal -** Immensely useful for invasions, otherwise just use items to heal   
**Wrath of the Gods** \- Not as broken as in Dark Souls I, but still a potent AOE   
**Lightning/ Great Lightning/ Sunlight Spear** \- slow but do great damage   
**Great Magic Barrier -** Great buff for lowering damage from all those infused and buffed weapons out there   
  

####  **Sorceries**

Not much here of use to a battle hexer, although spamming Homing Soul Arrow can be surprisingly effective and hilarious at long range in PVP.   
  

####  **Complete bastard spell rotation**

Start by buffing yourself with either Great Magic Barrier or Resonant Flesh, then Resonant or Dark Weapon, when in range pop Profound Still, switch to the Bat Staff and instant poison with Dark Fog, then switch to Caitha's Chime and Great Resonant Soul, if your opponent rolled away from you blast Great Resonant Soul through the Dark Fog cloud and they won't see it coming. In other words use every dirty trick in the book within a matter of seconds.
