### Acquired From

  * Purchased from [Felkin the Outcast](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast") and [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis") for 600 souls. Can also be bought from [Darkdiver Grandahl](/Darkdiver+Grandahl "Dark Souls 2 Darkdiver Grandahl"). 

### Notes

  * Basic dark spell with a high number of casts. Excellent for PvE. Less effective than [Resonant Soul](/Resonant+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Resonant Soul").  
Recommend casting it with Dark [Witchtree Branch](/Witchtree+Branch "Dark Souls 2 Witchtree Branch") and [Clear Bluestone Ring](/Clear+Bluestone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Clear Bluestone Ring") +2 for an outrageously fast casting speed, handy as a PvP standard projectile. Increasing [Attunement](/Attunement "Dark Souls 2 Attunement") will increase the number of uses. Multiple instances of this spell can be equipped at the same time, assuming you have the available attunement slots.
  * Also cast with [Dark Clutch Ring](/Dark+Clutch+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Dark Clutch Ring") and [Abyss Seal](/Abyss+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Abyss Seal") to maximize damage output to easily deal 800-900 damage in PVP and about 500-700 damage in PVE (Tested with 60 fth, 60 int, 50 atn, and dark Sunset Staff +5 SotFS)  
Does good poise damage and can do massive stamina damage.
