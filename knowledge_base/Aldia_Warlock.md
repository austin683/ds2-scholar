**Aldia Warlock** is an [enemy](/enemies "Dark Souls 2 enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Aldia Warlock** , characterized by lightly armored attire and modest damage output, is susceptible to staggering and stunlocking with a two-handed light weapon. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock Information

_This warlock shares the exact same appearance as the boss[Prowling Magus](/Prowling+Magus+and+Congregation "Dark Souls 2 Prowling Magus and Congregation"). _  
  
_The Aldia Warlock will start attacking you from a far range, although telegraphs its attacks slowly, making it very easy to dodge or strafe attacks. This enemy wears little armor and deals less than impressive damage and so is easy to stagger and stunlock with a two handed light weapon. Players also need to be careful on one specific attack; because this enemy is located on a cliffside, the dark[Force](/Force "Dark Souls 2 Force") attack can cause you to fall off the edge. _  
  
_This is the**ONLY** Non-Phantom enemy that _that will _drop the[Warlock Mask](/Warlock+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Warlock Mask") and [Cursed Bone Shield](/Cursed+Bone+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Cursed Bone Shield") (Before and after NG+). This makes these items very rare as this enemy does not respawn without the aid of a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). It is Recommended to farm these items on this enemy (As opposed to Red Invader [Merciless Roenna](/Merciless+Roenna "Dark Souls 2 Merciless Roenna"), who is also an Aldia Warlock variant) as bonfire ascetics only _effects _this enemy and a few Hollowed[Milfanitos](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito"). _  
  
_Generally, they wear[Warlock Mask](/Warlock+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Warlock Mask"), [Lion Mage Cuffs](/Lion+Mage+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lion Mage Set"), [Priestess Robe](/Priestess+Set "Dark Souls 2 Priestess Set") and [Skirt](/Priestess+Set "Dark Souls 2 Priestess Set") (can be identified by Merciless Roenna), the incantation is same as [Whisper of Despair](/Whisper+of+Despair "Dark Souls 2 Whisper of Despair"), and they're also [Fenito](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne"), this can be _indentified _by their cyan skin tone and crimson eyes, as shared with the other[Grave Wardens](/Grave+Warden "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden"). The catalyst/halberd (not to be confused with [Roaring Halberd](/Roaring+Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Roaring Halberd"); this one is double-edged) they wield shares the same design as the one wielded by one of the three [Skeleton Lords](/The+Skeleton+Lords "Dark Souls 2 The Skeleton Lords"), although you cannot obtain the catalyst by any means. _  
  
_It is speculated the Warlocks were once[Drangleic Priestesses](/Dark+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Dark Priestess"), which can be identified by the _robe _, as with the location of the Prowling Magus: the church, but they've sided with[Lord Aldia](/Aldia%2C+scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%2C scholar of the First Sin"), turned themselves into [Fenito](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne"), a race of the guardians of the dead, acted as a false idol, lured many [Undead Citizen](/Undead+Citizen "Dark Souls 2 Undead Citizen") and even [Milfanito](/Milfanito "Dark Souls 2 Milfanito") into Aldia's Keep or Sinners' Rise, and converted them into [Undead Aberrations](/Undead+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Undead Aberration") in order to recreate the _extincted _Dragon._  
  
_Another theory is_ Fenito _are probably a species created by Lord Aldia rather than being naturally existed, and that Aldia Warlocks acted as a successor among all the Fenito of Aldia's creations if compared to Navlaan, Najka, and Tark._  
  
_Oddly, they were supposed to appear in[King's Passage](/King%27s+Passage "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Passage") (via the TGS _Trailer),_but were moved to[Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana")._
