**Royal Kite Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing. 

     _"A metal shield issued to knights._

     _Nothing special about this shield, which is precisely why it is so easy to use, and the likely reason for its popularity._

     _People rarely agree over what constitutes quality, but the broad popularity of these shields proves that there are exceptions."_
