> Straight sword of warrior Vengarl of Forossa.  
> This sword is battle-worn and terribly rusted, but remains a deadly weapon owing to its incredible weight.  
>   
> Legend has it that it was built to test the limits of the strength of Forossa knights, until Vengarl swung it about like a wooden plaything, claiming ownership by demonstration.

### DS2 Red Rust Swords Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5. 

  * Although classified as a straight sword, it shares a moveset with most one-handed axes in the game, employing slightly slower slicing motions compared to straight swords.
  * Damage types list it as Slash/Thrust, though the only thrusting attack this weapon has is its parry.
  * It has slightly higher poise damage than other non-axe one-handed weapons. (5 points higher)
  * Can be used to Power Stance with a large selection of weapons, similarly to the [Warped Sword](/Warped+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Warped Sword").
  * Works with Red Rust Sword in either hand, and uses the Axe L2/LT power stance attack if used with a Dagger/Axe/Thrusting Sword in the other hand.
