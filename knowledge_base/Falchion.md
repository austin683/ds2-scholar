**Falchion** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Falchion** is a **[Curved Sword](/Curved+Swords "Dark Souls 2 Curved Swords")** emphasizing both strength and dexterity scaling. With a slash-oriented attack style, it offers a balanced performance in close-quarters combat

> A standard curved sword.   
>   
>  Each slash of a curved sword does less damage than a straight sword, but can deal a series of hits in flowing succession.   
>   
>  The sharp blade is effective at causing bleeding, but is soon dulled. Beware when facing rock-solid foe _s._

###  **Acquired From**

  * Buy from [Blacksmith Lenigrast](/Blacksmith+Lenigrast "Dark Souls 2 Blacksmith Lenigrast") in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") for 1200 souls.
  * Dropped by hammer-wielding [Forrest Grotesques](/Forrest+Grotesque "Dark Souls 2 Forrest Grotesque") in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods")

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * An Enchanted Falchion can be found behind [Vorgel the Sinner](/Vorgel+the+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Vorgel the Sinner") after defeating the [Belfry Gargoyles](/Belfry+Gargoyle "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Gargoyle") in [Belfry Luna](/Belfry+Luna "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Luna").
  * Very good early game weapon for a DEX-build in most PVE and PVP situations, but unreliable against bosses. The Falchion's moveset allows you to easily stay in range of your opponent while attacking. Because you step forwards slightly with each swing, it's difficult for enemies to escape your combo.
