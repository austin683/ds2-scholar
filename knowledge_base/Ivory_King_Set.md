The **Ivory King Set** is an armor set introduced in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+II+Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin"). It is part of the [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King") DLC. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

  
  
_Helm of the Ivory King of Eleum Loyce. The Ivory King kept his countenance from his people. The Knights of Loyce dutifully followed suit, never unhinging their helmets in public view.  
  
Armor of the Ivory king of Eleum Loyce. The land of Eleum Loyce was a vast rampart built to contain the ancient chaos. The Ivory King placed his throne upon the very mouth of chaos and served as the first line of defense._

### Set Location

  * Sold by [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") (74,4k) once 50 [Loyce Souls](/Loyce+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Soul") are collected and [Alsanna](/Alsanna%2C+Silent+Oracle "Dark Souls 2 Alsanna%2C Silent Oracle") has been spoken to (spend 15k souls at Maughlin's shop to unlock boss armor sets).

### Ivory King Set Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Upgraded physical defenses are only 25% higher.
  * Each piece of the set absorbs HP from each defeated foe, but only if the wearer is female. This effect stacks between pieces, as well as with pieces of [Loyce Set](/Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Set"), [Charred Loyce Set](/Charred+Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Set"), [Wicked Eye Greatshield](/Wicked+Eye+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Wicked Eye Greatshield"), [Butcher's Knife](/Butcher's+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Butcher's Knife") and any version of [Ring of the Evil Eye](/Ring+of+the+Evil+Eye "Dark Souls 2 Ring of the Evil Eye"). 
    * The Chest Piece absorbs 20 HP, while the Helm, Gauntlets, and Leggings each absorb 5 HP.
  * Supposedly there is reason to believe this effect was intended for male characters, but wasn't implemented.
