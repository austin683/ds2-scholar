## Forest of Fallen Enemies

  

  

###  [Flame Lizard (Flame Salamander)](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard")

  

Flame Lizards are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered in a tunnel found by jumping off a ledge near [Cardinal Tower](/Cardinal+Tower) bonfire.   

  * Fire Salamanders are lizard-like in appearance, and possess the frog-like ability to engorge their vocal sacs with hot air from their lungs 
  * Fire Salamanders are impervious to fire, have high HP, and move swiftly. They deal great damage by spewing fireballs, tongue lashing, and thrashing
  * Fire salamanders' physical attacks consume great amounts of stamina to block, and some may outright crush players even with their shields up
  * Poison is recommended to whittle down Salamander HP, and their tongue lashes are relatively easy to dodge by rolling.

  
They can be seen again in [Memory of the Old Iron King](/Memory+of+the+Old+Iron+King) as regular enemies and [Iron Passage](/Iron+Passage) as statues. 

  

  

###  [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry")

  

Clad in rotting versions of the [Infantry Set](/Infantry+Set), and found primarily in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants), these hollowed dregs were once the rank-and-file low-ranking soldiers of the Kingdom of Drangleic. Functionally little more than militiamen, they have weaker weapons and equipment than their Royal Knight brethren, but maintain some semblance of their original skills and have a predilection for hunting in packs. Though not very dangerous individually, Hollow Infantry have a notorious tendency to appear in large groups, where their threat level increases exponentially. Dealing with them piecemeal is the best tactic, though weapons with large, sweeping strikes can help deal with them in groups. Beware their attack flurry; though somewhat rare, this attack can do considerable damage and break the guard of the unprepared. They can also perform guard break maneuvers. 

  

  

###  [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight")

  

Heide Knights are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered after climbing a ladder beyond the [The Crestfallen's Retreat](/The+Crestfallen%27s+Retreat) bonfire.   

  * Heide Knights served as protectors for the ancient Heide kingdom. However, their land sunk into the sea long ago, and only time distortion could explain their presence in Drangleic.
  * Heide Knights' equipment is made of a special alloy that is incredibly durable. Even after thousands of years, weapons and armors found in game have not deteriorated.
  * Heide Knights are non-hostile until attacked by players.
  * Heide Knights have high HP, swift attacks and movement, and deal significant damage. They can surprise and stagger players with their combos.
  * Heide Knights, although proficient in close ranged combat, have no ranged attacks. They can also be parried and backstabbed.

  
In Scholar of the First Sin, they appear in Heide's tower, and, while generally non-hostile to begin with, some do attack on sight, and the rest will become hostile and roam the area after the Dragon Rider is killed. They no longer have a 100% drop.

  

  

###  [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier")

  

A common soldier in the earlier areas. Hollow Soldiers often play dead -- posing as defeated enemies -- or otherwise set themselves up to ambush the unwary. Possessing some semblance of military tactics, they tend to be significantly more dangerous in groups. They wield various weapons such as Bastard Swords, Estocs, and Halberds. Some use a shield, and there is a common Spear and shield variant. They will also make use of Firebombs or Longbows to rain punishment on enemies from a high vantage point. They are the hollowed undead versions of the knights of the Royal Drangleic Army and wear armor and helmets which slightly resemble the Paladin set from Dark Souls. 

  

  

###  Invader - [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan")

  

A former sorcerer surrounded by conflicting rumors and great controversy, Navlaan gained infamy when he was supposedly executed along with his entire village for practicing Dark magic, but the truth is far more complicated. At first glance Navlaan appears to suffer from dissociative identity disorder and displays two opposite personalities. The reality, however, is not so easily explained; perhaps it would be better to draw your conclusions after meeting him yourself. 

  

  

###  [Ironclad Soldier (Old)](/Old+Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Old Ironclad Soldier")

  

These are the first really "heavy hitters" you encounter. Knights sent from the Iron King's stronghold to reinforce Drangleic against the marauding giant horde, the Old Ironclads are weathered, weaker versions of their stronger cousins. They are nonetheless formidable, clad in heavy armor resembling a turtle's shell and which provides them with enormous defense. Difficult to stagger, these armored juggernauts carry massive footman's maces designed to smash defenders into paste. Though most of their attacks can be blocked, their swings do enormous stamina drain if defended against with anything less than a greatshield, so dodging them is recommended. They are the only source for the Old Ironclad set. Note that the Ironclads found in [Iron keep](/Iron+keep) are identical, but they have more health, and defense, and cause more damage than their weaker brethren. 

  

  

###  Dark Spirit - [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier#Dark+Spirit "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier#Dark Spirit") (Hollow Soldier) **NG+**

  

A common soldier in the earlier areas. Hollow Soldiers often play dead -- posing as defeated enemies -- or otherwise set themselves up to ambush the unwary. Possessing some semblance of military tactics, they tend to be significantly more dangerous in groups. They wield various weapons such as Bastard Swords, Estocs, and Halberds. Some use a shield, and there is a common Spear and shield variant. They will also make use of Firebombs or Longbows to rain punishment on enemies from a high vantage point. They are the hollowed undead versions of the knights of the Royal Drangleic Army and wear armor and helmets which slightly resemble the Paladin set from Dark Souls. 

  

  

###  Roaming Soul - [Knight Phantom](/Knight+Phantom "Dark Souls 2 Knight Phantom") **NG+**

  

A common knight of old, still fighting in defense of the realm. While you'd normally expect such a heavy warrior to sport a shield, he dual wields a [Heide Knight Sword](/Heide+Knight+Sword) and a [Dagger](/Dagger) instead. 

  

  

###  Dark Spirit - [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier#Dark+Spirit "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier#Dark Spirit") (Old Ironclad Soldier) **NG+**

  

These are the first really "heavy hitters" you encounter. Knights sent from the Iron King's stronghold to reinforce Drangleic against the marauding giant horde, the Old Ironclads are weathered, weaker versions of their stronger cousins. They are nonetheless formidable, clad in heavy armor resembling a turtle's shell and which provides them with enormous defense. Difficult to stagger, these armored juggernauts carry massive footman's maces designed to smash defenders into paste. Though most of their attacks can be blocked, their swings do enormous stamina drain if defended against with anything less than a greatshield, so dodging them is recommended. They are the only source for the Old Ironclad set. Note that the Ironclads found in [Iron keep](/Iron+keep) are identical, but they have more health, and defense, and cause more damage than their weaker brethren. 

  

  

###  Roaming Soul - [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier#Roaming+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier#Roaming Soul") (Syan Knight) **NG+**

  

_High-ranking Drangleic knights whose weapons and armor are modeled after those borne by Sir Syan, one of King Vendrick's bravest military leaders. Sir Syan met a dishonorable end on the battlefield during the war with the Giants;' shortly thereafter all of the knights who had been issued replicas of his armor went insane after putting them on._   
  
Equipped with greatswords or halberds, these knights are also equipped with greatshields as well. They wear Syan's Set of armor, and have special lightning attacks they use rarely. 

  

  

###  Roaming Soul - [Catarina Knight](/Catarina+Knight#Roaming+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Catarina Knight#Roaming Soul") **NG+**

  

A red spirit wearing the [Catarina Set](/Catarina+Set). 

  

  

###  [Forlorn](/Forlorn "Dark Souls 2 Forlorn")

  

_Born of Aldia's Obsession with the First Sin, the Forlorn lost both their corporeal form and a world to call their own. Now they drift into other worlds, ever in search of a home. But without self, one has neither beginning nor end, and so the Forlorn have only to wander._

  

  

###  [Armorer Dennis](/Armorer+Dennis "Dark Souls 2 Armorer Dennis")

  

Only appears in Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin.
