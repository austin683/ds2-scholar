_"An old armor that is oddly comfortable. Belonged to a Gyrm Warrior. To this day, the forbidden love of Prince of Alken and the Princess of Venn manipulates these marionettes. Surely they never imagined that their dolls would outlast their own kingdoms."_   

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Gyrm Warriors](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior") in [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros").
  * There is also [Gyrm Warrior Greathelm](/Gyrm+Warrior+Greathelm "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior Greathelm") which is a rare drop from Gyrm Warriors, and it only drops from those wearing the Greathelm except [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan"); it has the best physical defense stats for a helmet in the game when fully upgraded.

###  Notes

  * Greathelm and chestpiece offer the highest physical defenses among armor pieces upgraded with regular Titanite. Other best pieces are: [Steel](/Steel+Set "Dark Souls 2 Steel Set") / [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper+Set "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper Set") / [Mastodon](/Mastodon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Mastodon Set") gauntlets and Mastodon / [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Set") leggings.
  * Greathelm offers the highest overall physical and slash defense, as well as second highest poise.
  * Regular helm offers second highest physical defenses (almost equal to those of [Gyrm](/Gyrm+Set "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Set") helm, [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon Set") helm and [Velstadt's](/Velstadt's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt's Set") helm).
  * Chestpiece offers second highest physical defenses (except for strike defense, which is the highest) and second highest poise (almost equal to that of [Dragonrider set](/Dragonrider+set "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider set") chestpiece)
  * Requires 14 STR.
