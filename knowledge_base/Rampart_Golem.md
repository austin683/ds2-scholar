**Rampart Golem** is an [enemy](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. The **Rampart Golems** , animated by the Ivory King, were tasked with containing the chaos creatures within the wall's boundaries. Despite the frigid desolation that followed the opening of Eleum Loyce's doors, these golems remained steadfast. Armed with a lance that shoots magical projectiles and an ice-made shield, they are highly susceptible to backstabbing. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Dark Souls 2 Rampart Golem Information

The Rampart Golems were granted life by the Ivory King, charged with the containment of the creatures of chaos whithin the boundaries of the wall. When the doors of Eleum Loyce were flung open, the place turned frigid and lifeless, but the golems remained dutifully on guard. They carry a lance which can shoot magical projectile and a shield made of ice.   
  
Extremely vulnerable to backstabbing, and they can be respawned with [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at the second bonfire, along with [Dark Dance](/Dark+Dance "Dark Souls 2 Dark Dance") hex on a corpse.   
  
Oddly, their idling breath sound is the same as Abysswalker Artorias in _Dark Souls_.
