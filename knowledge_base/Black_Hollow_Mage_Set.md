**Black Hollow Mage Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Hood/Robe worn by Hollowed Drangleic mages.  
>    
>  Drangleic mages wore different garb depending on their sex. What function this served, however, is unknown, as with many old practices.  
>   
> This is a women's hood/robe.

###  Set Location

  * Starting equipment of Sorcerer class (robe only).
  * Dropped by [Necromancers](/Necromancer "Dark Souls 2 Necromancer") in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse") and [Undead Purgatory](/Undead+Purgatory "Dark Souls 2 Undead Purgatory") (no respawn outside of boss fight arena).
  * Hood is also dropped by [Astrologists](/Astrologist "Dark Souls 2 Astrologist") in [Iron Passage](/Iron+passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron passage").

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades#Ore").
  * Hood grants +1 to INT.
  * Hood offers second highest magic defense (almost equal to that of [White Hollow Mage](/White+Hollow+Mage+Set "Dark Souls 2 White Hollow Mage Set") hood and [Black Witch](/Black+Witch+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch Set") Veil).
  * Male variant is [White Hollow Set](/White+Hollow+Set "Dark Souls 2 White Hollow Set").
  * Hood is inferior and heavier than the white hood despite being rare, while the black robe is better than the white robe despite being heavier.
  * [Carhillion of the Fold](/Carhillion+of+the+Fold "Dark Souls 2 Carhillion of the Fold") wears this robe (without hood) regardless the fact it is a women's robe.
  * It is indicated that the necromancers in Huntsman's Copse are female; it can be identified by the mask.
  * The mask is skinned from the Necromancer's face, without lower jaw.
  * The robe is their full height according to concept arts, that's why they have no trousers for this set. You can actually see a White Hollow Mage trotting under the robe in Brightstone Cove Tseldora, next to third bonfire.
  * Farming the set is possible in Undead Purgatory, by escaping and re-entering [Executioner's Chariot](/Executioner's+Chariot "Dark Souls 2 Executioner's Chariot") boss fight.
