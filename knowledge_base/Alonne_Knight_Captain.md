### Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain Information

_The Alonne Captains are similar to their subordinates, except they are clad in heavier armor and are physically larger. Using larger, lightning-enchanted Katanas (upon closer inspection the sword more resembles the Ivory King Ultra Greatsword) and the same_ greatbows _as the Knights at their command, Alonne Captains are much more dangerous foes since they tend to go for_ quickdraw _to strike within a split second, though they share the same vulnerabilities. Periodically, when a player gets inside a Captain's natural sword range, the Captain may use unarmed strikes to stun or disrupt the player._  
  
_Some Alonne Captains do not carry_ greatbows _(especially Red Phantom version seen at higher bonfire intensity), they'll actively pursue the player and utilize quickdraws, a minor trivia, their shoulder_ paldron _loosely resemble Nineball from the original Armored Core, the red_ unmaned _AC in From Software's early title, this can be seen when Alonne Captains are coated with Red Phantom aura at higher bonfire intensity._

### Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain Strategy Tips

  * These are deadly opponents at all ranges. Their ranged attack is slow and easy to dodge, but packs a punch if it connects and will cause knockback if blocked. They are often encountered in groups, which makes dodging arrows more difficult. It is, however, generally preferable to engage them at range, since they are very fast, and have a lightning sword attack that can penetrate shields. They are very weak to lightning damage, however, and somewhat susceptible to magic, but resist fire to a great degree.

### Alonne Knight Captain Notes & Tips in DS2

  * They never chain attacks; after one strike they always sheath their blade and get ready to strike again. This gives a brief moment to counter-attack. Their red phantom counterparts can chain another slash after their initial strike, but this is very rare on their behalf.
  * In NG+, two red phantom versions wait in the furnace next to the Smelter Demon's area; they will attack the player as soon as they open either door. They have slightly more health and seem to move faster.
  * They have the same death cry as the Black and Silver Knights of Dark Souls, as well as similar lore; guarding and protecting over what is lost or has changed over the course of time.
  * Once they have drawn their greatbow, they will stop moving and will not track the player at all. As such they will likely not hit the player as long as they continue to move.
  * Defeated Alonne Knight Captains will subtract the following amounts of time from co-op sessions. See [Online](/Online "Dark Souls 2 Online") for more detailed information about Multiplayer Time Limits: 
    * 9 seconds - Crown of the Old Iron King
    * 1 minute - Iron Keep
    * 2 minutes - Iron Keep (Greatbow)
    * 4 minutes - Drangleic Castle
