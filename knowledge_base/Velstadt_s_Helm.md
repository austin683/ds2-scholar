_"Helmet worn by the Royal Aegis. Originally imbued with the power of miracles, now soaked with dark after extended exposure in the Undead Crypt._

_A knight from a faraway land was lured to this accursed land, but forgot even why he came, eventually reduced to a shadow of his former self."_

### Location

  * Bought from [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer) merchant in [Majula](/Majula) after you have defeated [The Royal Aegis Velstadt](/Velstadt%2C+The+Royal+Aegis). You must have spent at least 16,000 souls at Maughlin's shop for the armor to appear in his inventory.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Velstadt's Set](/Velstadt's+Set).
  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite).
  * Helm gives 1+ [Vitality](/Vitality) and [Endurance](/Endurance). 
  * Wearing the helm when starting the fight against [The Fume Knight Raime](/Fume+Knight) will cause him to immediatly switch to phase 2 (buffed ultra greatsword). Raime used to serve the king alongside [Velstadt](/Velstadt,+the+Royal+Aegis) until their rivalry separated them (see [Rebel's Greatshield](/Rebel's+Greatshield "Rebel's Greatshield") description), which explains the reaction.
