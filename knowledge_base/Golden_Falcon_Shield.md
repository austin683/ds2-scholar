**Golden Falcon Shield** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Small shield used by Volgen Falconers. Appears like a glistening gold falcon from afar._

     _Domestic Volgen soldiers are infamously timid, so it is no wonder that this fierce band of mercenary falconers was hired to compensate._

     _The falconers are rumored to be untrusting of others, and demanding of prompt, full payment. But no wonder; they deliver much more than they are paid, and are well aware of it."_

### Acquired From:

  * In [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"), follow path to the left above the second bonfire ([Ruined Fork Road](/Ruined+Fork+Road "Dark Souls 2 Ruined Fork Road")). After a mini-boss encounter, it is the item on the ground.
  * It is also a rare drop from [Falconers](/Falconer "Dark Souls 2 Falconer").

### Golden Falcon Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * In the original release, the Golden Falcon Shield is found on a corpse together with the [Dragonslayer's Crescent Axe](/Dragonslayer's+Crescent+Axe "Dark Souls 2 Dragonslayer's Crescent Axe"), which may have originally been intended as a reference to the Wheel of Time book series, particularly the characters Perrin who uses a Crescent Axe and his wife Zarine who is strongly associated with falcons.
  * This shield reappears in the sequel _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Golden Falcon Shield](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Falcon+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Golden Falcon Shield").
  * Given the influence of Berserk on Dark Souls series, it's a possible reference to Griffith, the leader of " Band of the Hawk " otherwise known as " Lord Falcon, The Hawk, etc.
