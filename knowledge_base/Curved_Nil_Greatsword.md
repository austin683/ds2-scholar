###  **Acquired From**

  * DLC [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King")
  * Obtained from a chest guarded by three golems in the uppermost floor when continuing the area after the 3rd bonfire. (**SPOILERS AHEAD:** You need to kill Aava and proceed with the scene in the area after so the ice melts from Eleum Loyce)

    * R1 chain is a modified version of the ds1 2h murakumo.
    * R2 is spin. 
      * Followup R2 can only be triggered while still in the active frames of the first R2. It's also the only move that causes knockdown.
    * Has an L2 attack. It's the running attack, slowed down with less damage and unparriable.
  * Has a unique strong attack when powerstanced with another curved greatsword, ultra-greatsword or greatsword.
  * Receives a damage bonus based on the wielder's NG cycle, signified with a glowing red aura which increases in radiance with subsequent NG cycles.
  * The maximum damage bonus is acquired at NG+9, while it receives no bonus on NG.
  * The damage bonus doesn't scale with bonfire ascetics.
  * It cannot be buffed by any resins or spells, but it can be infused by McDuff.

  * The NG scaling can change (as a summon) depending on the host's NG cycle. 
    * Does not scale AT ALL in the arena, no matter who's the host. However, the sphere visual effect to indicate the host is in NG+ will still be applied.
