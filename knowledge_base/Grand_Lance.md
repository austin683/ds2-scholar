### How to get Grand Lance in Dark Souls 2

#### DS2 Grand Lance Regular Version:

  * [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Orro"), at the beginning go into the left door and climb the stairs all the way up. There is a crane with a destructible prop which will lower a platform which needs to be dropped to. Then jump through the hole in the wall and you'll find the chest with the lance. Be warned, there is a giant in the same room just to the right of the hole you enter from.

#### DS2 Grand Lance Scholar of The First Sin:

  * [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"), right outside the King's Gate on a corpse. You need to kill the Last Giant for the Soldier Key to access this part of the area.

### DS2 Grande Lance Hints and Tips

  * Has dashing light attacks that allow you to charge and stun your target, and a leaping power attack that inflicts large damage.
  * This is the only lance that can be buffed using resins.
  * Upgraded with Normal [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * The damage for this weapon seems low when just looking at the stats however the high counter damage means attacking after an enemy has just attacked lets the weapon hit for over 700 dmg per hit.
  * Power Stance moveset is thrusting with both weapons, you can power stance with daggers, curved sword, straight sword, but not mace.
  * Also works great for PvE when combined with a shield with high stability and enough stamina, although requires either good lining up of attacks or turtling for efficent crowd control.
  * Infusing this weapon with poison is extremely effective in PvP and PvE. Charging with the weapon hits multiple times, allowing the poison to stack up quickly. Most enemies (and players) can be poisoned with a full charge attack and maybe one or two additional hits.
