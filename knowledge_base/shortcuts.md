**Shortcuts** are [Secrets](/Secrets "Dark Souls 2 Secrets") in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **These are areas that quickly take you directly through the points of interest in the game, allowing a shorter traveling time or playtime. These may be alternate or less known routes from the original path of the game that were discovered by players. Players who want to be thorough may opt for an ulterior route since shortcuts may bypass some content in the game. hortcuts are those who seek speed running, an easy/quick play-through or to gain access to later areas early in the game. These areas or passages are not well known to most players or must be thoroughly explored in order to be encountered in the game. Any notable areas that may be deemed as shortcuts or alternative routes can be added here.

## Shortcuts of Dark Souls 2

[Forest of the Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants")

  * After entering the [Cardinal Tower Bonfire](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower"), there is a wall to the right of the ladder going down that can be blown up by bombs or a heat fire. If you are on the other side you can throw a firebomb or use a flame weapon to explode the barrels, revealing the shortcut to the bonfire. If you are on the bonfire side, then just throw a bomb at the wall where the barrels will be on the other side. This shortcut will allow you to skip the beginning part of the tower, up until your first encounter with the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer"). (Video demonstration for wall shortcut please!)
