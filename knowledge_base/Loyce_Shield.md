**Loyce Shield** is a [standard shield](/standard+shields "Dark Souls 2 standard shields") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Loyce Shield** , the revered shield of the Knights of Loyce. Slowly regenerates HP when held. The duty of the knights of Loyce was to vanquish every twisted horror emerging from Chaos, unwavering even if their own king succumbed. [Standard Shields](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Shield of the Knights of Loyce._

     _The Knights of Loyce were commanded to strike down each malformed terror  
that arose from Chaos, and they would not hesitate even if it were their own king."_
