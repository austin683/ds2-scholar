### Dark Souls 2 Petrified Egg Location

  * The [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine"): after you kill the enemy shooting lightning at you, go up the steps and kill a 2-handed and a shield/1-handed knight. Do not go through the door yet, look around for an area to jump off of next to two chests. One is a mimic so be careful. After killing a Drakekeeper and the NPC invader [Dragonfang Villard](/Dragonfang+Villard "Dark Souls 2 Dragonfang Villard"), the Petrified Egg will be on an altar.
