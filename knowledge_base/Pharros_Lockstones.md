### Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone Usage

Unlock [Pharros' Contraptions](/Pharros'+contraptions "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' contraptions") in:

**Forest of Fallen Giants:**

  * Shows illusory wall in room under ballista trap near [Mild-mannered Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate") in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") \- [Cardinal Tower](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower") bonfire. Has a [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab") and [Chloranthy Ring](/Chloranthy+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Chloranthy Ring").

**No-Man's Wharf:**

  * On the second level area, in front of the house on the right, across the wide courtyard with the dogs. Creates bright light that scares [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") away in [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man%27s Wharf").

**Lost Bastille:**

  * Opens passage to [Belfry Luna](/Belfry+Luna "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Luna"), accessed by the [Servant's Quarters](/Servants'+Quarters "Dark Souls 2 Servants' Quarters") bonfire in the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"), go down a ladder and hit the revealed illusory wall upon placement.
  * One in the room with the twinblade chest reveals a room with a [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel"), and another room is already accessible via an elevator (the elevator room is revealed by default in SotFS).

**Earthen Peak:**

  * In [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") before the first boss, at the very bottom in a room of a poison mist floor. Has [Poisonbite Ring](/Poisonbite+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Poisonbite Ring") and a Soul of a Proud Knight.
  * Spill out poison to a small pool in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") (near the second boss, with a lot of mushrooms and mimic chest). Becomes water that cures poison and gradually heals after burning the windmill.

**Iron Keep:**

  * Three in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"). Two spill out water to a small pool and let the player get wet and survive the lava to get the items and chests. The two that add water will also heal slowly over time if the player stands in the water. Third opens Belfry Sol and bonfire.

**Doors of Pharros:**

  * There are several (10–20) doors that can be opened in [Doors of Pharros.](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros") Most of these Lockstones will activate various traps and unleash more enemies. The doors containing Mastodon Guards require 3 Lockstones to fully open and let them out, it also has [Santier's Spear](/Santier%27s+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Santier%27s Spear") behind it. The underwater middle Lockstone will effectively open the passage by itself without letting out the guard.

**Grave of Saints:**

  * Lowers two different bridges in [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") that lead to the same room. Across the bridge, there is [Poison Moss](/Poison+Moss "Dark Souls 2 Poison Moss") x2 and a skeleton with [Whisper of Despair](/Whisper+of+Despair "Dark Souls 2 Whisper of Despair") and a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). If you put them in the sockets by the rat statues while part of the [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant"), you will unleash a pool of corrosive acid that lingers indefinitely and breaks down equipment within seconds. If you put a Lockstone in the contraption to your left as soon as you come up the first set of stairs at the beginning, it will turn out all the torches down the hall. Putting a Lockstone in the contraption that is on the wall will start pouring water everywhere, which will put out your torch.

**Shrine of Amana:**

  * Just after the second bonfire, in Crumbled Ruins. In the water near the ramp structure just past the first Amana priestess. Standing at the base of the ramp and facing the dragonrider in the distance, it's just to your left. Reveals a hidden cave in the cliffside with a chest containing the Helix Halberd.

**Undead Crypt:**

  * Behind an illusory wall down the dark hole in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") (right after the two double-shield guards). It's best to clear the area of the respawning ghosts first. Opens a wall with a chest containing [Olenford's Staff](/Olenford%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Olenford%27s Staff") and [Great Lightning Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear").

**Aldia's Keep:**

  * Creates light in the long hall of [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep").

**Dragon Shrine:**

  * In the first area of the [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine"), on the floor under some boxes, behind the first knight. Reveals a hidden illusory wall with the [Judgement](/Judgment+Set "Dark Souls 2 Judgment Set") set and staff.

**Memory of Orro:**

  * There are two in one of the Giant Memories ([Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Orro") — located after the Pursuer fight). The first shows an illusory wall you can attack to get through. The second, located past this illusory wall, is pointless and activates a trap. The true entrance to the treasure room is a regular illusory wall next to it. This room contains the [Steel Armour Set](/Steel+Set "Dark Souls 2 Steel Set") and a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed").

**Frozen Elyum Loyce ([Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King") DLC):**

  * On the bridge with the ballistas on the far end, leads to [Durgo's Hat](/Durgo's+Hat "Dark Souls 2 Durgo's Hat").

### Pharros' Lockstone Notes, Tips & Tricks in DKS2

  * Doors unlocked by Lockstones reset upon entering NG+.
  * Pharros' Lockstone contraptions do not seem to be reset by using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). However, some chests will be reset with whatever item they previously contained. In other words, the loot respawns, but you do not need another Lockstone to access it. Bear in mind that this does not happen for all chests located behind Pharros' Lockstone walls. Only wooden chests and mimics are respawned by Bonfire Ascetics. Metal chests require an actual NG+ activation to respawn.
  * Some Pharros' Lockstone contraptions, particularly those located at [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints"), can only be reset by using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") bonfire.

  
**Glitches**

  * Using a Pharros' Lockstone while being summoned may consume the Lockstone and render the contraption unusable. Seems to only happen to contraptions that have animations, like the doors in Doors of Pharros or the bridges in the Grave of Saints.
