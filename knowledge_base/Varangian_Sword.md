Varangian Sword **is a Straight Sword that can be upgraded using regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") up to +10.

> Straight sword wielded by Varangians and engraved with a skull. A former king launched a campaign to capture these terrors of the high seas, but rather than imprison them, forced them into hard labor at No-man's Wharf. The king, wracked with fear and suspicion, began to see the progenitor of the curse in anything and everything. During his reign, sorcerers in particular suffered dreadful persecution.
