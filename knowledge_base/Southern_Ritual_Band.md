**Southern Ritual Band** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **Southern Ritual Band** is a covert gem rediscovered in Aldia, that increases attunement slots for spells. This unassuming yet potent ring alludes to dark deeds in its creation, mirroring the tragic fate of Aldia's residents Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> One of the secret treasures restored in Aldia. Raises the number of spells you may attune. This modest-looking ring contains very powerful magic. To imagine what unspeakable deeds were performed to create such rings, one need only recall the cruel fate of the resident of Aldia.

### DS2 Southern Ritual Band Tips and Notes

  * The +2 version can be acquired with a [bonfire ascetic](/bonfire+ascetic "Dark Souls 2 bonfire ascetic")
  * If the ring is removed while the slot or slots are in use, the spells attuned to the rightmost slots will no longer be attuned. Hadn't tried yet with equipping the same spell more than once if the charges are directly lost. (The game assumes that any unused spell casts used prior to unequiping SRB are from the slots from SRB, limited by how many casts the spell itself has. ie. Using great resonant soul, one equipped in own slots, and one equipped in the ring's slots, when casted 8/16 times and unequipping, 0 casts resulted. When casted 1/16 times then unequipping the ring, 7 casts remained. Finally when 7/16 casts were used, and the ring unequipped, 1 cast was left.)
  * This ring + pyromancy flame = literally any build in the game becoming a spellcaster.
