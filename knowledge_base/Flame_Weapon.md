### Flame Weapon Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Buffs weapon with fire damage. Duration doesn't scale with stats and is 90 sec. Equivalent to [Great Magic Weapon](/Great+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Great Magic Weapon") in effectiveness.
  * Requires no investment besides a spell slot to be used to its full potential, and an easy alternative to buying resins and potentially messing up your Soul Memory.
  * This spell is somewhat glitchy, as your player character will be locked for a second in a strange walking animation after the buff is applied. You can roll out of this animation, but will otherwise be left vulnerable to enemy attacks for its duration.
  * DS2's buff formula differs from other Souls games, instead relying primarily on the targeted weapon's base damage to determine how much AR the spell buff will add. Matching the spell buff with a damage type present on a weapon will add a flat bonus to the total AR, depending on whatever the weapon is infused with and/or naturally inflicts said damage type. A small scaling bonus is also added unless the targeted weapon doesn't scale at all with any stats.
