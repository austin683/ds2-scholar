_"Dress worn by a far-gone muse. Offers almost no physical defense, but is blessed with high resistance to magic._

_These enchanting singers were given song by the Great Dead One, and have little concept of self. They live only to sing,_  _and will continue singing until they can do so no longer."_

### Location

  * Found in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana"), in a cave covered with tree roots and guarded by an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre"), just before Rhoy's Resting Place bonfire.

### Notes

  * Upgraded from [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
