_"The clerics of Drangleic have retained their status throughout the ages, but were always at arms length from the royal family, as if their existence was little more than a formality."_

_"It is customary for clerics to wear different garb depending on their area, but the reason for this practice is unknown..._  
_This is a woman's robe."_

### Location

  * Found in Brightstone Cove Tseldora. Inside the chapel, in the room just before the boss fight against Prowling Magus and Congregation, there's an illusory wall to the left of the fog gate. Interact with it and go up the staircase, the [Priestess Set](/Priestess+Set "Dark Souls 2 Priestess Set") is on a corpse hanging through a window.
  * May also drop from [Dark Priestess](/Dark+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Dark Priestess") (only in dragon shrine), [Merciless Roenna](/Merciless+Roenna "Dark Souls 2 Merciless Roenna"), & [Peculiar Kindular](/Peculiar+Kindular "Dark Souls 2 Peculiar Kindular").

### Notes

  * Part of the [Priestess Set](/Priestess+Set "Dark Souls 2 Priestess Set"). 
    * Gives the same effect of the [White Priest set](/White+Priest+set "Dark Souls 2 White Priest set"), this is simply a female version.
    * Also believed to be a clothing of [Aldia Warlock](/Aldia+Warlock "Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock") (especially [Merciless Roenna](/Merciless+Roenna "Dark Souls 2 Merciless Roenna")), if you switch the helm into [Warlock Mask](/Warlock+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Warlock Mask"), the colour scheme fits well.
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades#Ore").
