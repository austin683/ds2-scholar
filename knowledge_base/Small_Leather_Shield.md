**Small Leather Shield** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Small, leather-covered round shield. A particularly traditional type of small shield._

     _Small shields are very light and easy to use, but not very stable when attacked."_

### Acquired From:

  * The Small leather shield can be found in a chest on the second floor of the [Cardinal Tower](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower") in the [Forest of the Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants").

### Small Leather Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Unlike most equipment with Black Armor Edition variants, this one is actually inferior to [Transgressor's Leather Shield](/Transgressor%27s+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Transgressor%27s Leather Shield") counterpart due to its heavier weight and lower Dark defense.
  * However, it has the lowest Strength requirement among all shields, ideal for Sorcerer or Deprived class.
  * The Small Leather Shield appears in both _[Dark Souls](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Small+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Small Leather Shield")_ and _[Dark Souls 3](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Small+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Small Leather Shield")_.
