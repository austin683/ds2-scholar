### DS2 Covetous Silver Serpent Ring Tips and Notes

  * Effect stacks with other soul increasing items such as the [Jester's Gloves](/Jester%27s+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Jester%27s Armor"). The effect stacks multiplicatively e.g. if you use the +1 ring and receive +20% and wear the [Jester's Gloves](/Jester%27s+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Jester%27s Armor") and receive their +10% then the total effect will be 32% or 1.20*(1.10*Base Souls). Furthermore you can stack multiple soul increasing items. If a player were to wear the ring +2 (+30%) and [Tseldora set](/Tseldora+Set "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Set") (+22.5%), then the souls they would receive would be approx. 59%, The effects of the ring also apply if you are playing as a phantom.
