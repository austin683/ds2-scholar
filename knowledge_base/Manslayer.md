###  **Acquired From**

  * After defeating the [Demon of Song](/Demon+of+Song) in the [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana), and before opening the doors to the lift, to the right should be a rocky path leading to the [Rise of the Dead](/Rise+of+the+Dead) bonfire. Go up the stairs and enter the door. Make sure you are hollow and have interacted with the [Milfanito](/Milfanito) that dissipates when you interact with her. From there, continue along the path and through the shrine room and down the next set of stairs. Now go outside and take a left and walk along the ledge. The katana will be inside a metal chest to your left near the wall.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgrade with: [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite) to +5
  * Infuse with Poison to increase the poison buildup.
  * Uses [Uchigatana](/Uchigatana) moveset.
  * Since the chest is made of metal, it does not reset via Bonfire Ascetic, you can only get a duplicate by either entering NG+ or trading with other players.
