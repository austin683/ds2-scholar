###  How to get Sacred Chime Hammer in DS2

  * [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex"): traded for [Soul of Velstadt](/Soul+of+Velstadt "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Velstadt"), and 3,000 souls.

### DS2 Sacred Chime Hammer Hints and Tips:

  * Upgraded with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"), to +5. Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * Fulfilling all the stat requirements (it's enough to have half of required STR) allows the two-handed strong attack to emit a spread of dark orbs after a small cast time, similar to that of [Velstadt](/Velstadt%2C+the+Royal+Aegis "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt%2C the Royal Aegis"). These orbs drain stamina if they are not blocked much like all dark magic. It also has homing similar to [Affinity](/Affinity "Dark Souls 2 Affinity"), and the sigil of [Scraps of Life](/Scraps+of+Life "Dark Souls 2 Scraps of Life"), but the orb's landing location is fixed once it's locked on, unlike Affinity.
  * Recommended to infuse with Dark to increase the power of the special attack.
  * Consumes very low stamina for a weapon of its class. With 30 END, you can do 6 one handed R1s and 5 two handed R1s before stamina runs out. For comparison, the Crypt Blacksword, a potential competitor for the Sacred Chime Hammer, can just barely do 5 one handed R1s and 4 two handed R1s with the same endurance. And compared to the Demon's Great Hammer, a weapon of the same class with a similar moveset, but no dark damage, it is even more dramatic. With 30 END, the Demon's Great Hammer can do 4 one handed R1s and 4 two handed R1s.
