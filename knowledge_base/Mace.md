**Mace** is a **[Hammer](/Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Hammers")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki").** **Mace** can be obtained as starting equipment for the [Cleric](/Cleric "Dark Souls 2 Cleric") class. Its notable strength lies in its effectiveness against most enemies in the early game, thanks to its susceptibility to strike damage. The vertical swing arc of the Mace can be limiting when facing groups of enemies. To overcome this, players have the option to dual-wield two fully upgraded maces, providing a more versatile and effective approach in combat.

> A club fitted with a head crafted for battle.   
>   
>  The mace is the archetypal blunt weapon. It has a primitive appearance, but also many advantages, including the ability to break the guard of a shield.   
>   
> Keep the proper distance from your foe, and this can be a very effective weapon.

### DS2 Mace Hints and Tips

  * Most enemies in the first half of the game are vulnerable to strike damage, making the mace a very strong early game weapon, particularly for caster builds as even with little strength it still hits hard.
  * It's biggest weakness is its vertical swing arc, making it less useful against groups, however you can dual wield two fully upgraded maces to cover this weakness.
  * Don't try to block a mace user's attacks repeatedly in PvP, try dodging before 1 or 2 blocks. Blocking mace hits is a big drain on your stamina and will get you staggered fast.
