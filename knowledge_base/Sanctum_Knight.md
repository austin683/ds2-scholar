An invisible knight roams the sanctum, seemingly immune to physical attacks. They often carry dual swords or dual crossbows.

### Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Knight Strategy Tips

  * Initially start of as 'ethereal'. In this form, they CAN be locked-on, but they are IMMUNE to Physical damage. Elemental damage seems to bypass this, but they have insane resistances, with their **Lightning** resistance being the highest.
  * Break the statues made of armor, scattered around the Sanctum, to render them visible. They can now be damaged normally using Physical danage. Very susceptible to backstabs.
  * Use elemental weapons to attack invisible sanctum knights
