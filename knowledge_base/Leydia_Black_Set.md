**Leydia Black Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
  
_"Hood/Robe worn by Leydia witches._   
  
_Leydia apostles worship Galib, god of disease. They once resided in the Undead Crypt beside Fenito._   
  
_The Leydia witches grew conceited, and began to manipulate both the onset and curing of disease, making themselves the effective gatekeepers of the crypt."_

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Leydia Witches](/Leydia+Witch "Leydia Witches") in [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt).

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite).
  * Hood grants +1 to INT and FTH.
  * The hood is also fitting for clothing with matching colours, notably [Black Witch set](/Black+Witch+Set) and [Astrologist's set](/Astrologist's+set).
