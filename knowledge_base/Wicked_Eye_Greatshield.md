**Wicked Eye Greatshield** is a [Greatshield](/Greatshields "Dark Souls 2 Greatshields") in Dark Souls 2. **Greatshields** can be used not only to block an enemy but allows player to do **shield bash**(Great shields replaced parry ability with heavy shield bash).

    

     _"A greatshield with an unsettling design. Covered with the prints of countless hands._

     _The true origin of this shield is unknown. No amount of polishing can clear its face of the mysterious hand prints._

     _Effect: HP absorb."_

### Acquired From:

  * Iron chest in the [Gutter](/Gutter "Dark Souls 2 Gutter"). From the Central Gutter bonfire, bear right and make your way down to the ladder guarded by some enemies. Climb up the ladder and cross the suspended walkway. Proceed into the cave directly ahead and open the chest.

### Wicked Eye Greatshield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * While the shield is held, each kill gives the wielder a small amount of health, roughly the same amount as a regular [Ring of the Evil Eye](/Ring+of+the+Evil+Eye "Dark Souls 2 Ring of the Evil Eye").
  * Stacks with the Ring of the Evil Eye.
  * This shield was chosen to be in the game as one of the winners of the Shield Design Contest held by Namco Bandai and FromSoftware.
