### Heide's Tower of Flame Walkthrough

### Accessing from Majula

To the left of the cliff where the Victor’s Stone is, there is a large stone archway, with a staircase going down a tunnel. Coming to a circular room, there is a pillar in the center with a symbol on it. Examining it mentions that the the contraption does not move. [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt") is able to later open a path to [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse") after encountering her in [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame").

Going to the right down the hallways to a spiral staircase, on the left there is a chest with [Crimson Parma](/Crimson+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Parma"). Continuing down the stairs takes you to a room which will bring you to a pull chain on the ledge on the left, which raises the big door below. Going through the door leads to a waterway, and up the stairs is another pull chain to open the door should you wish to go back and further on a corpse with [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead") and [Broken Thief Sword](/Broken+Thief+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Broken Thief Sword"). Going down the hallway takes you to the entrance of [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame").

### Abundance of Old Knights

As you enter through the waterway from [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), you are greeted with a beautiful vista of the flooded towers and sprawling walkways. On your left, as soon as you exit, is a [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") sitting. He won't aggro until you kill the boss of the area. Straight ahead is a round platform with a [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") wielding a large greatsword, but you may find a staircase to the right which leads down to a [bonfire](/bonfire "Dark Souls 2 bonfire"), just before him. Going straight up the stairs you encounter a mace wielding [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight"). Behind, draped along the railing is a corpse with a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). There is also a [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") resting in the area, which as mentioned earlier, won't engage you unless you engage it first or after you kill the [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider").

Proceeding upstairs bring you through an archway another platform with an [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") who wields a greatsword and shield. After killing him, approach the contraption in the ground raising a post with a lever. Pulling the lever raises the outer ring of the platform on the tower directly across from the lever. Laying in front of one of the columns of the arch is a corpse with a [Lloyd’s Talisman](/Lloyd%27s+Talisman "Dark Souls 2 Lloyd%27s Talisman"). Going left from the lever leads across a long walkway and into a tower where three [Old Knights](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") wait.

This can be a fairly difficult fight early in the game, and it's advisable to lure the middle [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") wielding a greatsword out onto the walkway first. The other two [Old Knights](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") are happy to wait for you to dispatch the first one, but will both try to rush you together once their comrade is dead. A good way to deal with this encounter in melee is to get close enough to provoke both into attacking at the same time. These [Old Knights](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") almost always use the same three-slash attack pattern, and dodging around both of them while they do this will give you some openings. Alternatively, if you can manage to lure them onto a ledge then knock them down, it would make for an easier confrontation. After dealing with these three nuisances. a lever pop out the ground on the right of the entrance in this tower. You can proceed down either side of the tower.

### To the Dragonslayer

Going to the left brings you to an encounter with another [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") and an always hostile [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight"). (In NG+. 3 **Black Phantoms** wielding a Halberd guard the way, once killed, each of them drop a [Cracked Blue Eye Orb](/Cracked+Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Blue Eye Orb") and a [Token of Fidelity](/Token+of+Fidelity "Dark Souls 2 Token of Fidelity")). On the left, you'll find a broken dead-end staircase that leads down close to the water. At the bottom of these stairs you'll find a corpse with a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing"). Straight ahead of where you entered, a stairway up to another level and another [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") await. A shade summon-sign for [Devotee Scarlett](/Devotee+Scarlett "Dark Souls 2 Devotee Scarlett") can be found on the right before the stairway, but only if you have summoned her before at [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") After passing a railing-less platform, you will encounter the [Dragon](/Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Dragon"). The easiest way to kill it is using a bow from the lower area, although you can guess that this may be very tedious and may take a while.

Once defeated, it will drop a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") and a [Watchdragon Parma](/Watchdragon+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Watchdragon Parma"). On the platform where the dragon was is another contraption which raises when you approach. Pulling the lever lowers the bridge allowing the player access to the [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue") and face off against the [Old Dragonslayer](/Old+Dragonslayer "Dark Souls 2 Old Dragonslayer").

### To the Dragonrider

Going to the right leads to a walkway with a [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") sitting against the railing, and a staircase down to another platform and an [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight"). (In NG+. a Black Phantom with a [Chariot Lance](/Chariot+Lance "Dark Souls 2 Chariot Lance") appears on the platform, it drops a [Token of Spite](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite") when killed). On this lower platform, you'll find a [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") resting on a chest containing the [Ring of Binding](/Ring+of+Binding "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Binding"), and the mist straight ahead. Going through the mist will take you to the fight with [Dragonrider Boss](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider"). If you are in human form you can summon an NPC phantom named [Masterless Glencour](/Masterless+Glencour "Dark Souls 2 Masterless Glencour"); there is an NPC summon sign outside and to the right of the boss mist.

BOSS FIGHT: [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider")

A few notable things about this boss fight:

  * He wields a halberd and greatshield.
  * He is not particularly fast and becomes a timing pattern easily dispatched.
  * Circling around to his back will keep you safe from his sweep attacks and leaves him open for attack.
  * He can be staggered after several hits.
  * He can also be attacked via bow if you aim at him from where the first lever appears. Once you have gotten him to almost zero health he will turn around and face you with his shield. Once he does this all it is is a matter of getting to him. He should die with just one hit.

### To No Man's Wharf

After killing boss, proceed through the doorway and up the stairs. You come to a platform inside the tower with a bonfire. Nearby is the [merchant](/Merchants "Dark Souls 2 Merchants") [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt") who sells [miracles](/miracles "Dark Souls 2 miracles"). After you exhaust her dialogue, she will move to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), in the room with the mysterious contraption, and can open the path to [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse"). She will also give you the [Saint's Set](/Saint%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Saint%27s Set") and the [Idol's Charm](/Idol%27s+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Idol%27s Chime"), if your faith is up to level 30.

You can kill her however, and when you leave and reload, you''ll find the [Idol's Chime](/Idol's+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Idol's Chime") and [Rotunda Lockstone](/Rotunda+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Rotunda Lockstone") in her place.

From the tower, exit straight onto a walkway and into another tower with a spiral staircase. Descend down and hidden behind the staircase is a corpse with a [Monastery Charm](/Monastery+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Charm"). Go through the doorway and down the hall.

On your right the hallway opens up and you meet an [Old Knight ](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") guarding a doorway. Kill the [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") and continue straight to the end of the hall where you find a corpse hanging over the railing with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") and a [Dark Troche](/Dark+Troches "Dark Souls 2 Dark Troches"). Close by are two corpses with a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight") and an [Old Knight Halberd](/Old+Knight+Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight Halberd"). Go back down the hall and into the doorway the [Old Knight ](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight")had been guarding.

Down the flights of stairs brings you to the next level down. Going left leads to a dead end where a [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier") protects a metal chest that contains 1x [Sublime Bone Dust](/Sublime+Bone+Dust "Dark Souls 2 Sublime Bone Dust"). To the right is a hallway which leads to a round room with a pressure plate elevator in the center. Stand on the plate and descend to the next level down.

At the bottom, head out into the flooded corridors, passing the first small alcove to find a larger area to your left. This area holds a [Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") and a few [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") that rise up from the waters. There is a doorway behind these enemies that is blocked by a petrified enemy._If you unpetrify it and go up the stairs you will find a[Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight") and a corridor. A body hang on the railing and it holds 1x [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard"), going left leads to a dead end at an iron door. Going right to the end of the hallway brings you to an iron chest in the alcove to the right which contains the [Knight Set](/Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Knight Set") of armor._

Continue and at the end of the hallway, a knocked out hole in the wall leads to path and a [bonfire](/bonfire "Dark Souls 2 bonfire"). Continuing on from here will bring you to [No-Man’s Wharf](/No-man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man%27s Wharf").

Going to the right down the hallways to a spiral staircase, on the left there is a chest with [Crimson Parma](/Crimson+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Parma").

Straight ahead is a round platform with an [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") wielding a large greatsword. Just before confronting him, there is a staircase to the right which leads down to the first [bonfire](/bonfire "Dark Souls 2 bonfire") of the area. After passing the first enemy, head straight up the stairs to encounter another one. Killing him guarantees a [Sublime Bone Dust](/Sublime+Bone+Dust "Dark Souls 2 Sublime Bone Dust") drop, and he does not respawn _(his drop will also disappear if you are killed before picking it up, preventing development of your[Estus Flask](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask"))_. On the right, draped along the railing is a corpse with a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy").

Proceeding upstairs bring you through an archway another platform with yet another [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") who wields a greatsword and shield. Approaching the cliff directly in front of the arc, will raise a post with a lever, from the ground. Pulling the lever raises the outer ring of the platform on the tower directly across from the lever. Laying in front of the right column of the arch you've just come from is a corpse with [Lloyd’s Talisman](/Lloyd%27s+Talisman "Dark Souls 2 Lloyd%27s Talisman"). Continue down the long walkway to enter a tower base where three more [Old Knights](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") await.

This can be a fairly difficult fight early in the game, and it's advisable to lure the middle [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") wielding a greatsword out onto the walkway first.

On the left of this area, you'll find a broken dead-end staircase that leads down close to the water. At the bottom of these stairs you'll find a corpse with a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing").

Straight ahead of where you entered is a stairway up to another level and into a railing-less platform with a [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") who wields a sword and shield. On the platform is another contraption, which also raises when you approach. Pulling the lever lowers the bridge allowing the player access to the [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue") and [Old Dragonslayer Boss](/Old+Dragonslayer "Dark Souls 2 Old Dragonslayer") fight. At the top of the bridge on the left is a corpse with an [Old Radiant Lifegem](/Old+Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Old Radiant Lifegem") and an iron chest containing a [Ring of Binding](/Ring+of+Binding "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Binding") and 5x [Human Effigies](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy").

### To the Dragonrider

Going to the right leads to a walkway and a staircase down to another platform and a sentinel. (In NG+. a Black Phantom with a [chariot lance](/chariot+lance "Dark Souls 2 chariot lance") appears on the platform, it drops a [Token of Spite](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite") when killed). The chest on the right contains 3x [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"). Going through the mist takes you to the boss of this area; if you are in human form, you can summon an NPC phantom named Masterless Glencour right outside the mist.

Down the flights of stairs brings you to the next level down where you encounter an [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight").

At the bottom, go through the doorway into the flooded hall. An [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") will stand in a room on the left, in front of a doorway.
