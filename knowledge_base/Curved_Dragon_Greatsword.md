The unique quality of the **Curved Dragon Greatsword** lies in its special attack, a potent maneuver that comes at the cost of durability, requiring careful consideration by wielders. As a relic from a time long past, this curved greatsword embodies the essence of an ancient world.

> A curved greatsword forged from the soul of the Ancient Dragon. In the Age of the Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of grey crags, archtrees, and everlasting dragons. Effect: special attack (strong attack consumes 10 durability per use)

### DKS2 Curved Dragon Greatsword Acquired From

  * Can be obtained at the location of where you fought [Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja"). You can only activate the giant crystal after you have obtained the [Ashen Mist Heart](/Ashen+Mist+Heart "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Mist Heart") and then you will be transported into Memory of a Dragon, where you examine a dragon to get the [Ancient Dragon Soul](/Ancient+Dragon+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon Soul"). Then you're able to craft the weapon from [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex").

### Curved Dragon Greatsword Hints and Tips in Dark Souls 2 

  * Reinforced with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5.
  * The special strong attack is similar to the [Drake Sword](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Drake+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Drake Sword") or the [Dragon Greatsword](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Greatsword") special attack from Dark Souls. The only notable difference is that there are multiple streams that do damage that spread out from each other slightly. You can also hit your enemy with the strong attack and the special attack at one time which will result in both attacks being taken into account. With that the weapon does the highest Strong Attack Damage for Dexterity weapons in game. (Takes 10 durability to use, 5 with Bracing Knuckle Ring +2).
  * The Special strong attack also has incredible range and travels approximately in a tight V pattern with 3 damaging spirals traveling outward.
  * The Strong/Special attack knocks down enemies (PvP).
  * Dual wield/Powerstance Strong Attack does NOT double up the range attack, its just a 'simple' (Ultra) Greatsword dualwield attack.
  * The special attack projectiles can travel through some walls and obstacles to strike enemies.
