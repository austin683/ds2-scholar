_"Used to hide in the cover of night. Those who are especially adept assassins are often hired as bodyguards._

_In an attempt to stave off the curse, King Vendrick hired shadowmen to put down the Hollows, but before long they were Hollowed themselves"_

### Location

  * Drop from [Suspicious Shadow](/Nimble+Shadow "Dark Souls 2 Nimble Shadow") (NG+) or with the use of a Bonfire Ascetic at the No Man's Wharf bonfire.
  * 2 shadows appear with the boss. Drop rate is "Rare" even with stacked item discovery and rusted coins.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Shadow Set](/Shadow+Set "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Set").
  * Upgraded with [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab").
  * Can drop duplicates.
  * Resembles the one worn by healer Ingward from  _Dark Souls_ , which is believed to be based on Plague Doctor Mask, but without hood.
