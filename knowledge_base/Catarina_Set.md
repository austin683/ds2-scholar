**Catarina Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
_"Helm/Armor/Gauntlets/Leggings-Distinctively shaped apparel worn by the Knights of Catarina._   
_Outside Catarina, they are often ridiculed for their Onion-like shape, infuriating the proud knights, but masterfully forged curved design makes it very effective for parrying."_   
_Changed to:_   
_"Odd helmet/armor/gauntles/leggings shaped like an onion._   
_This [armor piece] appears rather absurd, but its multi-faced construction is in fact quite practical as it effectively deflects physical attacks._   
_The old tales speak of brave Catarina knight wearing this [armor piece] as they rushed courageously into battle."_

###  Set Location

  * Rare drop from NPC Dark Spirit Catarina Knight in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Forest of Fallen Giants") (NG+).
  * Helm is in one of the 5 chests in a room right after the entrance to [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon%27s+Sanctum) ([Crown of the Sunken King](/Crown+of+the+Sunken+King) DLC).
  * Gauntlets and leggings are found behind a breakable wall in the room past the Foyer bonfire in [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower) ([Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King) DLC). The wall can be destroyed by blowing up a [Barrel Carrier](/Barrel+Carrier "Barrel Carrier") next to it (firebombs won't do).
  * Chestpiece is found in [Frozen Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce) ([Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King) DLC), in one of the 5 frozen chests before the bridge on the way to Inner Wall bonfire.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Twinkling Titanite").
  * Chestpiece makes the character wield weapons in a slightly different stance, due to big belly presumably. Very noticeable with daggers, straight swords, katanas and curved swords while two-handling.
