**Black Witch Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

  
  
_"Robe worn by Zullie the witch,seducer of Alva of Wayfarer. Boasts excellent magic defense._   
_When Zullie the witch learned of Alva's dedication to Saint Serrate she used all manner of tricks and deceit to ruin him, but in the end she would spend her life with him, supporting his endeavors."_   
_Scholar of the First Sin added:_   
_"The witch, as unloving as she was unloved, finally found illumination through her blighted existence."_

###  Set Location

  * Sold by [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan") (27k): speak to him while Hollow after completing his quest line or release him and speak to him while in Human form.
  * [Scholar of the First Sin] The entire set (minus hat) and Black Witch Veil are a guaranteed drop from NPC invader [Gutter Denizen](/Gutter+Denizen "Dark Souls 2 Gutter Denizen") in [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"), who is encountered past Central Gutter bonfire, at the bottom of the pit (all sconces in the area must be lit for the invader to appear).
  * Black Witch Domino Mask is dropped by two [Dual Avelyn Guardian](/Dual+Avelyn+Guardian "Dark Souls 2 Dual Avelyn Guardian") phantom in Belfry Sol, who only spawn once per ascetic/playthrough (very rare drop).
  * Black Witch Veil is dropped by phantom wearing the Astrologist set, who is found at the very start of [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") and only spawns once per ascetic/playthrough (very rare drop).

###  Black Witch Set Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades#Ore").
  * Hat gives +1 attunement slot, but requires 20 INT. (* Intelligence is only needed for defensive stats, attunement slot is obtained even without it).
  * Black Witch Domino Mask increases spell damage by ~3% and lowers HP by ~15%. 
    * Test 1 – spell damage: Soul Level 227 with 50 INT and Olenford's Staff, 587 without mask and 605 with it, against the same enemies.
    * Test 2 – HP: Soul Level 227 with 32 VGR and no other equipment, 1'714 HP before equip, 1'456 HP after.
  * Robe offers the highest magic, lightning and dark defense, as well as second highest fire defense  
(only 2 points below that of [Chaos](/Chaos+Set "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Set") & [Hexer's](/Hexer's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Hexer's Set") robes).
  * Gloves offer the highest magic defense and the highest lightning defense (equal to that of [Looking Glass](/Looking+Glass+Set "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Set") gauntlets), as well as second highest dark defense (equal to that of [Bone King](/Bone+King+Set "Dark Souls 2 Bone King Set") and [Lion Mage](/Lion+Mage+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lion Mage Set") cuffs).
  * Gloves change character's nails appearance (tested on a female character).
  * [Scholar of the First Sin] Black Witch Veil negates curse completely.
