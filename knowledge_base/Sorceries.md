**Sorceries** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a type of **[Magic](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic")** that inflicts elemental damage with its offensive spells. Most of the spells in **Sorceries** are offensive focused, others can also be used to manipulate sound and light. You can only cast **Sorceries** if you have a Catalyst equipped. [Staves](/Staves "Dark Souls 2 Staves") are the main catalyst for casting Sorceries. **Sorceries** can be cast by the player at any time and each requires a specific number of [Attunement](/Attunement "Dark Souls 2 Attunement") slots in order to equip. All Sorceries have a required amount of [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") that must be met in order to use. Magic damage can be improved by increasing the Intelligence stat. The soft cap for magic damage is 40 Int.

### What are Sorceries in Dark Souls 2?

**Sorceries** have different offensive spells and can be used in different scenarios. A required amount of Intelligence is needed along with a Staff to cast sorceries. Most Sorceries take up only one Attunement slot, and most of these spells have high damage output. In equipping a catalyst, you would also need to consider the casting speed and scaling to maximize your damage output. Some Catalysts will release the spell at the tip of the weapon/staff, this can cause some spells to miss if the opponent is too close to your character, but works best at mid to long range.

It can also affect how your aim, you would most likely miss your shot when an opponent is in a downward slope position. Some catalysts will release it immediately at the character's hand, which is good if the opponent is close to you, as it will release the spell quicker.

### Best Staves in Dark Souls 2

  * [Azal's Staff](/Azal's+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Azal's Staff") \- This staff has the highest possible damage, requiring 35INT but with a penalty of only 4 Durability and a slow casting speed.
  * [Staff of Wisdom](/Staff+of+Wisdom "Dark Souls 2 Staff of Wisdom") \- This is a sorcercy exclusive staff with a requirement of 50INT, it also offers the highest magic damage without any drawbacks. This staff has medium casting speed.
  * [Witchtree Branch](/Witchtree+Branch "Dark Souls 2 Witchtree Branch") \- This staff has the fastest casting speed in the game requiring only 16INT, making it easy to cast spells quickly without needing to equip casting speed equipment. Its damage output is lower compared to other catalysts but you can combine this staff with another catalyst to throw off your opponent's dodge timing.
  * [Staff of Amana](/Staff+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Staff of Amana") \- This staff is perfect if you would go for a build that mostly consists of sorcery spells as it has perfect S scaling, requiring 35INT. It has a special buff that boosts the damage of spells while you're in your human form. The penalty for using this staff is it has a slow casting speed.
  * [Sorcerer's Staff](/Sorcerer's+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sorcerer's Staff") \- This staff has the second fastest casting speed in the game while having a decent overall damage. It is a good starter staff as it only requires 10INT. It is a strong enough staff for starters and can help you fight your way until you get more specialized staves.
