#  BENHART 

  * Benhart is the knight you encounter, just before petrified Rosabeth. He appears to be wielding the "Moonlight Greatsword" from the previous titles.
  * The fact that he refers to his sword as "My ancient sword", might further allude to it being the Moonlight sword, as it was also in the spiritual predecessor series-Kingsfield
  * After clearing the way by unpetrifying Rosabeth, speaking to him will earn you the "Joy" gesture, and the ability to summon him later on. (more info needed)
  * Dialogue (Add Spoiler tags from the text editor if you know how to! link: <https://fextralife.com/forums/t26017/wiki-spoiler-tags/> )
