### Heide Knight Strategy Tips in DS2

  * The Lost Bastille: Don't let him fall off the edge. If you do, the item drops in the water and you can't get it.   
A good strategy for beating them is to bait their attacks and get in a couple swings, as well as back stab fishing when an opening is available. You can also try using a guard break as your opening attack on the knight; if it lands he will stand up and begin to stagger away in a dazed state, leaving him wide open for an easy backstab. Or you can back off from him, and when he start running to get you, you do a power attack staggering him and then roll away from him.

### DS2 Heide Knight Move Set

  * Sword Move Set: 
    * Slash: usually comes in two's and three's. they swing around clumsily but also fast. 
      * blockable
    * Backslash: If you stand behind them, they will quickly slash behind as well. They also do this after backstabs. 
      * blockable
  * Spear Move Set: 
    * Jab and Spin: They will jab once before spinning with their spear 
      * blockable 
    * Swing and Stab: they with swing twice before jumping forward to stab you with the spear

### Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight Notes & Trivia

  * In Scholar of the First Sin, they appear in [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame") rather than at a select few other locations, and, while generally non-hostile to begin with, some do attack on sight, and the rest will become hostile and roam the area after the [Dragonrider](/DragonRider "Dark Souls 2 DragonRider") boss is killed. They no longer have a 100% droprate either.
  * They attack fast but its easy to get backstabs on them if you keep moving right. Its also really easy to parry their swings. Unless your weapon can stagger them this is a really easy way to kill them without getting hit.
  * Quite strangely, despite the fact that they wear armor, they have high resistance to strike damage, but not to thrust damage. Using 2H rapier power attack makes them an easy target (SotFS).
