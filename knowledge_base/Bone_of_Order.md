### Dark Souls 2 Bone of Order Usage

After a certain amount of illegal disconnects from a multi-player session (usually while being invaded) the game puts a penalty on you. This penalty makes it so that you cannot summon or be summoned by other players. You can, however, still be invaded. The bone of order is used to fully reconnect the player's character to the server.   
  
Note: it appears that game crashes due to stability problems on the Xbox One are counted as illegal disconnects at this time and may necessitate the use of a Bone of Order. It is unclear at this time whether this is limited to crashes that occur when playing as a summoned or invading phantom, or when playing in online mode in general.   
  

### Bone of Order Location in DKS2

  * The player only gets one Bone of Order when they start the game. You do not receive any extra bones upon starting NG+ or higher.
  * After "a certain number" of hours, a Bone of Order will spawn at the location where the game begins in Things Betwixt. The range of time for a new Bone to spawn appears to be 10-14 hours of gameplay without illegal disconnects after using a Bone of Order.
  * You may need to quit and reload your game for the Bone of Order to spawn at Things Betwixt or travel to/from another area to trigger a reload of the map. If the item still does not show up, then you need to wait longer.
