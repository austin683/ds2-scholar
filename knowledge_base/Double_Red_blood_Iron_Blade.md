Hello, hello everyone, if you're here you probably find it interesting and for that, thank you!   
So, the set is:   
**Alva helm, Faaram armor, Faaram guantles and Alva boots.**   
**The shield it's a thrones defender** (not upgraded because I'm lazy).   
**Double Red Iron Blade +10, not infused.**   
To see better the strategy just watch the really short video to better understand what I wrote up there.   
  

  
  
Thanks for the attention, goodbye!
