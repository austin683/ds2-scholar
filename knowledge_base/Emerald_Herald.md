**Emerald Herald** is an [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") in **Dark Souls 2.** The **Emerald Herald** is first encountered in the town of [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), where she sits beside the cliff overlooking the ocean. Her true nature and purpose are shrouded in mystery, but she plays a crucial role in the player's quest by providing them with the means to level up and upgrade their [Estus Flask](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask"). 

### Emerald Herald Information in Dark Souls 2

  * The Emerald Herald serves as the player's means of leveling up, replacing the [Bonfires](/Bonfires "Dark Souls 2 Bonfires") of _Dark Souls_ in this respect.
  * She gives the player an [Estus Flask](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask") upon introducing herself. Bringing her [Estus Flask Shards](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard") will increase the total amount of flasks that you can hold.
  * She gives the player the [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") when spoken to upon arrival in [Dragon Aerie.](/Dragon+Aerie "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Aerie")
  * The Emerald Herald's real name is Shanalotte, a name given to her by the [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon"). She was created specifically to break the undead curse, but her creators failed and she did not come out as intended. It is possible that she was the result of one of Aldia's experiments. She also mentions that she is the one who draws the Undead to Drangleic in order to find the one who will break the curse and accomplish her purpose.
  * [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan") tells the player many people believe the Emerald Herald is the last [firekeeper](/Firekeepers "Dark Souls 2 Firekeepers"), though this is unlikely, seeing as she is not disfigured like the other firekeepers, nor does she stay in Majula to watch over the flame. Navlaan will also say she is sometimes known as the "Muse".
  * The end-game credits tells that there is a voice actress for Young (Child) and Old (Not mentioned, it was blank) Shanalotte. Could she be the Firekeeper from the CG intro? She tells us that it's her own manifestation who bring us in Drangleic.
  * Child voice is in the Dragon Aerie. Normal voice everywhere else.

### Emerald Herald Encounters in Dark Souls 2

  * [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), near the bonfire.
  * [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"), at the bottom of the stairs that lead to the Castle's entrance.
  * [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"), at the top of the stairs leading to [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") as soon as the player grabs the [King's Ring](/King's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King's Ring").
  * [Dragon Aerie](/Dragon+Aerie "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Aerie"), looking out at the Aerie, easily noticeable when coming out of the elevator which leads to this area.
  * [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Throne of Want"), stands to the left past the [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") King's Gate, before the long path leading to the throne.

### Emerald Herald Dialogue

Introduction

  * _Are you…the next monarch?__Or… Merely a pawn of fate?__Bearer of the curse…  
_ _I will remain by your side. Till this frail hope shatters…_  
 _Take this with you. May it ease your journey.__Go on, and see the King._  
_He who made Drangleic what it once was; he who peered at the essence of the soul._  
_King Vendrick._

Greetings

  * _Bearer of the curse, seek misery.__For misery will lead you to greater, stronger souls.  
__You will never meet the King with a soul so frail and pallid._
  * _Seek those whose names are unutterable, the four endowed with immense souls._  
_Their souls will serve as beacons.__Once you have found them, return here to me._  
_So that hope will not fade away._
  * _Bearer of the curse…_ _Seek souls. Larger, more powerful souls.__Seek the King, that is the only way.  
__Lest this land swallow you whole… As it has so many others._

Obtained an Estus Shard

  * _Is that a shard you've found?__Here, let me see it. So that I may help you._  
_To see light, to see hope…_ _However faint it might be…_

Talk

  * _Over the hill and past the forest is the King's castle._  
_Where a man peered straight into the essence of the soul.__But what ever came of it…_
  * _Those who come to Drangleic seeking salvation soon lose hope, and turn Hollow._  
_It happens to them all, sooner or later.  
__That blue knight at the base of the tower… His spirit is already broken._  
_Although he does offer sound advice.__Perhaps he is a foreshadowing of your own future?_
  * _That tiny thing inside the ruins…_  
 _An ancient being that will mock your very existence._  
_She imparts sound wisdom.__Provided you find her on a good day…_
  * _The sign you bear will drain your very souls…_ _And without souls, you will turn Hollow._  
_Stay strong, do not lose hope.__Even when you have precious little time._
  * _For when the Undead dies, it is never truly dead, but only one step closer to Hollowing._  
_Not all Undead are Hollows, but all Hollows were once Undead._
  * _If you find an Estus Shard, bring it to me.__So that I may ease your burden._

Obtained one Great Soul

  * _You have acquired the soul of an Old One._  
_That is more than most Undead can say._

Obtained two Great Souls

  * _The soul and the curse are one and the same._  
_Your soul has grown stronger still.__I only hope it brings you what you wish._

Obtained three Great Souls

  * _Proceed, bearer of the curse.__It is the only choice left to you._

Obtained four Great Souls

  * _You are blessed with a myriad of souls._  
_Bearer of the curse, make your way to the castle._

Greeting after going to Drangleic Castle

  * _Bearer of the curse. I will always be at your side.__Until hope has fully withered…_

Outside Drangleic Castle after opening the Shrine of Winter through Soul Memory

  * _Your soul is still frail and pallid…_  
 _If you proceed regardless, your fate will be more terrible than mere life or death._  
_But I will not stop you, if that is your heart's desire._
  * _..._

Outside Drangelic Castle after opening the Shrine of Winter with four Great Souls

  * _This castle is isolated.__But nonetheless, you must forge on._  
_To bring an end to your journey…and mine._
  * _..._

At the Undead Crypt

  * _This ring is the symbol of the King.__Use it to gain passage, through the King's Gate…  
_ _and venture to the far east…_ _Bearer of the curse, if you are to be the next monarch,_  
_Then, one day, you will walk those grounds…_ _without really knowing why._
  * _..._

At the Dragon Aerie

  * _Bearer of the curse.__Long have I awaited one such as you, one who might shatter the shackles of fate._  
_One who can set me free.__Bearer of the curse, it was my own manifestation that led you here._  
_The ancient dragon has watched over the world for aeons past.__Take this.  
__Do not resist. The dragon welcomes you._
  * _..._

At the stairs leading to the Throne of Want

  * _My journey is already complete.__My name is Shanalotte._  
_The dragon gave me this name, for I was born with none._  
_I was born of dragons, contrived by men._  
_By ones who would cozen fate herself… They are the ones who created me._  
_But they failed.__I did not come out as intended._  
_Fate would not be bested, and men were cursed once again._  
_If you proceed, Nashandra will come after you._  
_Knowing that you will take the throne, and link the fire._  
_She covets the First Flame, and the Great Soul._  
_Put Nashandra to rest._
  * _..._

When attacked

  * _What are you…?_
  * _If that is your wish…_

Ending Narration

  * _You, who link the fire, you, who bear the curse…_  
 _Once the fire is linked, souls will flourish anew, and all of this will play out again._  
_It is your choice…To embrace, or renounce this…_  
 _Great Sovereign, take your throne._  
_What lies ahead, only you can see._
