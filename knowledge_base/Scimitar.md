**Scimitar** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. The **Scimitar** is a small [Curved Sword](/Curved+Swords "Dark Souls 2 Curved Swords") with a narrow blade, known for its lightweight design and quick slashing moves. Its rapid attacks give opponents little time to react. Despite having a sharp blade, it's not the best choice against armor and tough skin

> _A small curved sword with a narrow blade._   
>  _  
> The rapid slashing of the lightweight scimitar hardly allows the victim to catch a breath. Has a sharp blade, but is rather ineffective against armour and hard skin._

###  **Acquired From**

  * Treasure pickup in the secret area accessed by riding the top of the elevator that runs between the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille") and [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man%27s Wharf").
  * Dropped by Hollow scimitar-wielders in [No-Man's Warf](/No-man's+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man's Wharf").
  * Starting equipment from the [Swordsman](/Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Swordsman") (+1 version)
  * Drops from the varangian swordsmen in [No-Mans Wharf](/No-man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man%27s Wharf")

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Like all curved swords, the Scimitar has excellent directional adjustment and tracking which allows you not only pressure the enemy but also constantly face them so they can not punish your flurry of attacks with a back stab.
  * The running attack is extremely powerful in PvP situations but also very easy to parry due to its wind up animation and is also countered by simply back stepping.
  * When wielded in the left hand, strong attack is a parry.
