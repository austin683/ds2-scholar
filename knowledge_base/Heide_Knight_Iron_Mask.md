_"Iron mask worn by Heide Knights._

_Whether Heide refers to a kingdom or was just a name for the land is not clear, for no records date back far enough to tell._

_All that is known is that the Way of the Blue has its origins in Heide, and that Heide was later subsumed by the sea."_

### Location

  * Found in [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue"), past [Old Dragonslayer's](/Old+Dragonslayer "Dark Souls 2 Old Dragonslayer") arena, in a chest on the balcony next to [Blue Sentinel Targray](/Blue+Sentinel+Targray "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinel Targray").
  * [Scholar of the First Sin] Guaranteed drop on NG (can still drop on NG+) from [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") found in [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter") (spawns once): find the first [Swollen Mongrel](/Swollen+Mongrel "Dark Souls 2 Swollen Mongrel") past a long bridge, turn in the opposite direction, cross the house and drop down.

### Notes

  * Alternative helm for [Heide Knight Set](/Heide+Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight Set")
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite")
  * Offers second highest bleed resistance (equal to that of [Manikin](/Manikin+Set "Dark Souls 2 Manikin Set") mask)
