### Repel Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * A stronger version of [Twisted Barricade](/Twisted+Barricade "Dark Souls 2 Twisted Barricade"), with the cost of taking three attunement slots and has five less possible casts than Twisted Barricade.  
Gives you complete invulnerability for 1.5 seconds after the initial cast, unaffected by [Lingering Dragoncrest Ring](/Lingering+Dragoncrest+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Lingering Dragoncrest Ring")
  * This hex is particularly useful in fighting enemies with extremely damaging attacks.  
Does not diminish damage taken from Iron Keep's flaming floors.  
Unlike Twisted Barricade, it is possible to get an infinite amount of duplicates in one playthrough by farming [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord") with [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic").
