**Sunlight Parma** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing. 

     _"A small shield depicting a hero of yore._

     _Perhaps these famed champions are no more, or perhaps they have no desire appear in public view._

     _But their very absence has made tales of their brave deeds all the more alluring, and this shield memorializes one of their brethren."_

### Acquired From:

  * Offer 10 [Sunlight Medals](/Sunlight+Medal "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Medal") to the Altar of Sunlight. 

### Sunlight Parma Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * This is one of the 6 shield designs selected by FromSoftware as part of the Dark Souls II Shield Design Contest.
  * The emblem depicts the valiant [Solaire of Astora](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Solaire+of+Astora "Dark Souls 2 Solaire of Astora") from _Dark Souls_.
  * The shield has moderate Poison and Bleed damage reduction, however, since it has low physical damage reduction, it is more like a decorative shield rather than a practical one.
  * Has 100% lightning reduction when lightning infused in DX11/SotFS
