### DS2 Watcher Greatsword Hints and Tips

  * Reinforced with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5
  * Pressing L2 while two-handing will cast a magic weapon buff on the sword, consuming 10 durability. This buff lasts for 45 seconds and is not affected by lingering Dragoncrest Ring or the Northwarder's set.
  * Most infusions increase magic scaling. Poison/bleed and lightning infusions result in S level magic scaling when upgraded to at least +3. However the scaling bonus is actually less than when on the magic infusion path making things confusing.
  * You cannot use L2 to enchant this weapon if the other hand already has an enchanted weapon. You will still perform the enchanting action and consume 10 durability though. The defender greatsword (and presumably another watcher greatsword) is the only exception to this, where you can successfully enchant both swords.
  * If upgraded along the poison path using the two handed L2 buff will poison the character slightly, it is assumed the same happens for the bleed path.
  * The general consensus seems to be that this weapon is somewhat inferior to the [Defender Greatsword](/Defender+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Defender Greatsword"). This is not true. While this weapon has inferior elemental scaling, it has a higher base damage for its element compared to the Defender Greatsword. Furthermore, when using a Magic infusion, and at 50 Intelligence, this weapon will only end up with 17 (elemental) AR less than that of the Defender Greatsword (306 vs 323). In addition, this weapon consumes less stamina when being used. All in all, this weapon is just as good as the Defender Greatsword.
  * With a Magic infusion path, this weapon will receive around 448 Magic AR, the rest being around 147 Physical AR (~595 AR final). Because a fraction of this damage is split, the [Moonlight Greatsword](/Moonlight+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Moonlight Greatsword") is arguably better due to its 100% Magic AR (Assuming you're using a Magic infusion and have 50 INTELLIGENCE, the AR will be ~539 straight Magic damage). However the Watcher Greatsword is faster, and will consume less stamina. It is also to be taken into account the fact that this sword can be buffed with it's 2hL2, and the MLGS can't be buffed at all. This pushes the Watcher Greatsword's magic AR above the MLGS, while being slightly lighter and having a better moveset. The MLGS has ranged capabilities with its strong attack. In the end, the MLGS is pretty much a more situational blade than the Watcher Greatsword, being better for punishing fleeing opponents with it's powerful r2 attacks.
  * It is not possible to use any kind of enchantment on the weapon (such as Crystal Weapon or Dark Weapon). You are limited to the self enchant property of the blade.
