### How to get Old Knight Pike in Dark Souls 2

  * From **The Mines** bonfire of [Harvest valley](/Harvest+valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest valley"), exit the room, turn right. Now you're in a open area with a small watch tower in the middle. On the left side, there is a small alley going uphill with a pile of rocks in the middle. At the rocks go up hill and a Dark magic giant will be behind a barricade, the giant will break the barricade and attack you when you get close. Don't kill him. Behind the giant is another barricade which leads to a room containing the Old Knight Pike and some other goodies. Normal weapons cannot destroy this barricade, so you have to bait the giant into destroying this barricade.
