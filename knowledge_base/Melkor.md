##  Build Strategy

I have found magic builds (hex, sorcery, etc.) to generally be the most powerful and versatile. However, I have also found that, for me, the true joy of dark souls lies in melee, in dodging and rolling and slashing up close. This build will serve you admirably if you, too, seek hand-to-hand combat, and it has powerful pyromancies for those enemies (or players) who are especially resistant to melee. I use the spears and halberds with the shield, and I dual wield and powerstance the two blacksteel katanas. With the flame weapon buff, this build is also effective in PVP in the right hands, although I use the Pilgrims of Dark covenant and thus mainly get my PVP through being invaded.
