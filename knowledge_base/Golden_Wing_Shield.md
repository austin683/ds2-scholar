**Golden Wing Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A blue shield with a gold relief of wings. Likely a symbol of guardianship used by the Knights of the Blue._

     _Contains materials enchanted by magic, allowing spells to be deflected by parrying."_

### DKS2 Golden Wing Shield Acquired From:

  * The Golden Wing Shield is located in the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"). If you port to [The Saltfort](/The+Saltfort "Dark Souls 2 The Saltfort") bonfire in [Sinner's Rise](/Sinner%27s+Rise "Dark Souls 2 Sinner%27s Rise"), go down the ladder and take an immediate left. Run across the bridge there and into the doorway at the other end. There are some stairs to the right. Go down them. There is a cell in front of you as you come down and a door right to the left of it. Go through the door and straight to the back. There is a false wall here. Press (X) on PS3 or (A) on Xbox to open the false wall. Inside there is another false wall to your left. Again press (X) or (A). Ahead is a corpse across a small gap you must jump. Jump across and get the Flame Butterfly and 3 torches on it and then drop on to the little ledge to the right. Follow this all the way down to the end where the corpse with the Golden Wing Shield is.

### Golden Wing Shield Hints and Tips in Dark Souls 2:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Not intended for blocking damage directly, it's for a steadfast spell parrying on par with [Cleric's Small Shield](/Cleric%27s+Small+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Cleric%27s Small Shield").
  * Oddly, it also provides Curse and Petrification resistance, surpassing the [Lion Clan Shield](/Lion+Clan+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Lion Clan Shield").
  * This shield reappears in the sequel  _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Golden Wing Crest Shield](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Wing+Crest+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Golden Wing Crest Shield").
  * Originally, this shield was the shield the warrior used in the beta.
