**Darkdweller (Dark Stalker)** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.   

  

  

'Spider monkey' like creatures (they're also known as "Dooters", "Spooky Bleeders" and "Reachasaurus-Rex") with very long arms, hence a **very long** attack reach. They attack quickly and are quite deadly. They can cause bleeding with 2-3 hits but are terrified of the light and will cower at the sight of it (e.g., a torch); however, if you provoke them for too long, they can rage out even in bright light. If possible, try and get behind them for a backstab, but be careful. 

  
  
  

###  Strategy tips

  

  * Avoid their physical attacks.
  * Keep your distance during the spinning attack
