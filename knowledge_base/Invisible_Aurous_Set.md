_"Helm/Armor/Gauntlets/Leggings of kings of the desert land of Jugo. First worn by Aurous, the land's heroic founder._   
_According to legend, the armor of Aurous is composed of a mysterious substance that cannot be seen by cowards. What do your eyes tell you? "_

### Set Location

  * Spend 16000 souls at [Maughlin's](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") shop in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") then come back when you have 0 souls. Talk to him and he'll give you the set.
  * Armor can also be dropped by Dark Spirit [Rhoy the Explorer](/Rhoy+the+Explorer "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy the Explorer") in [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints").

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Raises equipment load (Helm & Gloves =+1% Equipment Load, Chest and legs= +1.5% Equipment load. Total 5% for full set).
  * Contrary to popular belief, this set does not become visible by ranking up in the [Company of Champions](/Company+of+Champions "Dark Souls 2 Company of Champions").
  * Armor becomes visible when aiming a bow. This can only be seen briefly as you change to First-Person view.
  * Armor becomes visible when rolling with the simpleton's ring. It can only be seen briefly at the beginning and end of the roll before you become invisible.
  * In addition to giving extra carry weight the whole set is incredibly light for the protection provided, essentially freeing up a lot of soul levels which would have otherwise been spent on VIT.
