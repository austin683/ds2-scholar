Who has the highest physical defense in the world? Havelyn? I say not! This is the real OG, The [Gyrm](/Gyrm+Warrior+Set) [astodon](/Mastodon+Set), the grandmaster of all kind of defense. it blocks physical damage without shield, also carries Magic Magic Shield to black all kinds of magic, it could be the new Giantdad, who knows?

##  Introduction:

  
  
What rings do you get? Bech? Ring of Giants (Giants! where's your Giantdad now?) Ring of Steel Protection (Steel! Steel! Steel!Balls of Steel!), Royal Soldier Ring (Gyrmastodon serves only one king, you), Ring of Life Protection. Weapons are Twin Bastard Swords, cause I'm a OG Forkin Bastard! Oh! Magic? I have Dark Hail, Repel, Dark Orb, Shield? Magic Magic Shield! Havelyn? more like running out of ammo! This is the real OG, Gyrmastodon The Grandmaster!

##  Stat:

While Gyrm Warrior Set has the highest physical defense for headpiece (greathelm) and armor, Mastodon Set has the highest physical defense for gloves and boot, among all armors under normal titanite upgrading path. when you combine both armor pieces together, you get Gyrmasterdon, the upmost toughest physical defense. the armor has extremely high physical defense that is on par with Havel's Set, It's the tank! take that archers! your bow and arrow can only deal 10 to 30 damage to this thing!   
It is, however, extremely vulnerable to all kinds of elemental damage, take extreme caution...
