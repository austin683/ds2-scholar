### Black Gloves Description

_"Black Hood/Robe/gloves/Boots Belonged to Straid of Olaphis._  
_Straid was invited to the old kingdom of Olaphis for his wisdom, but its depth was such that people soon feared him, and in the end Straid was led into a dreadful trap._  
_Straid spent several lifetimes as stone. During this hiatus, kingdoms rose and fell, until the land called Drangleic came to be."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Obtained from [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis) by trading him 4 boss souls and speaking to him.
  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia) in [Majula](/Majula) if you killed Straid. Progress through story
