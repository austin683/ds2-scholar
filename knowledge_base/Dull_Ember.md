### Dark Souls 2 Dull Ember Location

**DARK SOULS II - ORIGINAL**

  * The dull ember is found at the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"), in the first large open area, after you lower the draw bridge, walk up the bridge, roll down, and go right. (You may first want to kill an archer on your left before the first fog). Run and jump towards the chest that contains the [Zweihander](/Zweihander "Dark Souls 2 Zweihander") opposite the fog, then run and jump again towards the metal platform without falling into the lava below. There will be a corpse almost falling off the ledge that has the ember.

  * After the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") Boss Fight, head for the small nest at your right and examine it.
