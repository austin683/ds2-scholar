### How to get Sanctum Repeating Crossbow in Dark Souls 2

  * An illusory wall in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"). In the room where you are invaded by [Nameless Usurper](/Nameless+Usurper "Dark Souls 2 Nameless Usurper"), turn right and interact with the wall. The wall will move, revealing a hidden room with two transparent warriors and a chest. Within that chest is the Avelyn. (Using a Bonfire Ascetic will not respawn this item)
  * Dropped by either [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") dual-Avelyn wielding grey phantom or [Bowman Guthry](/Bowman+Guthry "Dark Souls 2 Bowman Guthry") (Can be spawned multiple times per cycle on NG+ and above at 1st bonfire in Door of Pharros).

### DS2 Sanctum Repeating Crossbow Hints and Tips

  * It can inflict high elemental damage by enchanting it with fire, lightning dark etc and then using the corresponding bolts.
  * Dual-wielding Avelyns requires the player to be mindful of stamina consumption and reload time. A poorly planned shot can render you helpless. As with any bow or crossbow, make sure to time your shots well, keep your distance, and be wise with your stamina consumption.
  * You can cancel the aiming of any crossbow and attack instead with the weapon held in your other hand by pressing (Y/Triangle) and immediately following it up with a light or heavy attack.
  * Since it is found in a metal chest, bonfire ascetics when used on the second bonfire of the undead crypt will not reset the chest the Avelyn is in.
