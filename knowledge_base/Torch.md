**Torch** is a special item in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Torch** , held in the left hand, illuminates dark areas and can be used to light standing torches in specific locations while repelling certain enemies. Its usage is limited by time, providing a straightforward solution to brighten low-light environments. [Tools](/Tools "Dark Souls 2 Tools") are unique, reusable items which assist the player during various facets of gameplay ranging from basic communication to assisting in boss encounters.

### Torch Information in DKS2

The Torch is a new feature to the Dark Souls series and is used in Dark Souls 2 to help with exploration. It has the simple effect of increasing the brightness in low-light areas. In darker areas, this lowers the risk of unseen enemies, traps, and pits. However, a downside is that while using the torch, the player is unable to use a left-hand slot (weapon/shield/magic); moreover, the torch can only block partially and at a high stamina cost. One can switch the torch away when in combat, though this extinguishes the torch; when you re-equip it, you must re-light it.  
  
Instead of having a torch in your inventory, any torch you obtain in the game adds 5:00 minutes to a counter. In this way, as you find torches, your total "torch time" grows, until you start using your torch(es), at which point the timer starts to count down. Consider being judicious with your torches, so that when you really need them, you have enough time. **So far, no one seems to sell torches, so that, other than drops by enemies, there is a very finite number in the game**.  
As you move through the world, there are places to light your torch, and also things you can light with your torch. In particular, there are dark areas/levels (e.g., [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter")) where you can move from one torch sconce to the next, lighting each as you go. This progressively adds light to the level and gives you places where you can re-light your torch if you extinguish it (or it gets extinguished) for any reason.

### Ways to Light a Torch in DKS2

  * At a bonfire, toggle from the "Rest at bonfire" message to the "Light the torch" message.
  * At a torch sconce that is already lit, select "Light the torch."
  * Use a [Flame Butterfly](/Flame+Butterfly "Dark Souls 2 Flame Butterfly").

### Torch Locations in DKS2

  * There is one torch in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt") near the first bonfire behind a wagon.
  * There are several torches you can loot inside the keep in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants").
  * Dropped by torch-wielding enemies.
  * Can also farm using the [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") and opening the chest in the manor on the second floor, this will net you 3 torches and 3 titanite shards.
  * 3 on a corpse in [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon%27s+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Sanctum").
  * On a corpse behind the Saint's Grave drawbridge that you lower with a Pharros's Lockstone.
  * A great place to farm is The Gutter. Many torch-wielding hollows spawn here and have a high chance of dropping one. Can farm about 1 hour and 30 minutes worth of torchlight in 30 minutes.

### Dark Souls 2 Torch Usage

  * Other than lighting scones, the torch is only used a couple of times for other things. 
    * [No-man's Wharf](/No+Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No Man%27s Wharf"), [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") \- Scare the creatures who are afraid of light.
    * [Sinners' Rise](/Sinner%27s+Rise "Dark Souls 2 Sinner%27s Rise") \- Illuminate the boss arena.
    * [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") \- Burn the windmill.
    * [Dark Chasm of Old](/Dark+Chasm+of+Old "Dark Souls 2 Dark Chasm of Old") \- Light the braziers.
  * The torch is also very helpful in spotting pitfalls and hidden paths when you walk through dark shallow waters.
  * The torch will also help light your path in the poison mist caverns of [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley").
  * Rolling in flammable pools ([The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"), [Black Gulch](/black+gulch "Dark Souls 2 black gulch")) while holding the torch will set them on fire.
  * Being hit with a tar bomb while holding a torch will result in an explosion, causing damage to the player.
  * Lighting a torch while soaked in tar will result in an explosion, causing damage to the player.
  * Also, beware that rolling in shallow water or walking under waterfalls will extinguish the torch.
  * Increases targeting range of about 1.5x.
  * Usage of a torch upon entering the area in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") near [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne") causes him to become **permanently** hostile and unsummonable as a white phantom. He will become friendly again if you absolve your sins.
  * Lighting all sconces in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt") causes an NPC red phantom to spawn. At least 2 sconces in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia's+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia's Keep") cause the same NPC to spawn.
  * The firelight from sconces as well as the torch will make spiders try to run away. They don't seem willing to attack a player holding a torch.
  * Holding a torch also greatly extends the aggro range of enemies. This can prove particularly dangerous in areas filled with ranged enemies, like No Man's Wharf. Another dangerous place to light a torch is Shrine of Amana, doing which will attract Amana Aberrations from a great distance, surprising an unaware player.
