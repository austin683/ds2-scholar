### Alonne Knight Gauntlets Description

_"Gauntlets worn by Alonne Knights._

_The bonds of the Alonne Knights, who_  
 _served the Old Iron King, were mightier_  
 _than the land's iron, but in the end_  
 _the knights were subsumed by the flames_  
 _that brought the castle down"_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Dropped by [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight) and [Alonne Knight Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain).

### 

### Notes

  * There are only 2 Alonne Captain pieces (the helm and the chest-piece). The Gauntlets and Leggings are from the regular Alonne Knight set.
  * Upgraded with titanite shards.
  * Armor set has very good poise, and good defense for its weight.
  * The chest offers extremely high amount of fire resistance, highest in the game if fully upgraded for any heavy armor.
