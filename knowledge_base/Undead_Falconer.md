**Falconer** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.   

  

  

Falconers are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered in the fields of [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt) immediately after starting NG+ / Journey #2.   

  * Falconers are mercenaries from the city of Volgen, usually hired as bodyguards for the elite. The ones found in the fields, however, are hollow, and have no sense of their former duties
  * Falconers are equipped with swords, bows, and a falcon that can attack the player. They draw their swords at close range, fire arrows at long range, and send falcons at mid-range
  * Players must deal with multiple falconers at once when starting NG+, so players would do well to prevent getting surrounded by them
