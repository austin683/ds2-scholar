## 1\. Introduction

* * *

Dark Souls II is a sequel to Dark Souls , taking place long after the previous game's events. Characters, items, and references to legends that lived during the first game are sometimes referenced or can be found in Dark Souls II .

_Prologue "Perhaps you've seen it, maybe in a dream. A murky, forgotten land... A place where souls may mend your ailing mind. _  
 _ You will lose everything, once branded. The symbol of the curse, an augur of darkness. Your past, your future, your very light. None will have meaning, and you won't even care. By then, you will be something other than human. A thing that feeds on souls, a hollow. _  
 _ Long ago, in a walled off land far to the north. A great king built a great kingdom. I believe they called it Drangleic. Perhaps you're familiar. No, how could you be... But one day, you will stand before its decrepit gate, without really knowing why. Like a moth drawn to a flame, your wings will burn in anguish. Time, after time. _  
 _ For that is your fate. The fate of the cursed."_

## 2\. Dark Souls I Summary

* * *

The Dark Souls intro is pretty self explanatory to lay out the history of the world of Dark Souls.

**_"I_** _n the Age of Ancients the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray crags, Archtrees and Everlasting Dragons. But then there was Fire and with fire came disparity. Heat and cold, life_ _a_ _nd_ _death, and of course, light and dark. Then from the dark, They came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame. Nito, the First of the Dead, The Witch of Izalith and her Daughters of Chaos, Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights. And the Furtive Pygmy, so easily forgotten._

_With the strength of Lords, they challenged the Dragons. Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales. The Witches weaved great firestorms. Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease. And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and the Dragons were no more._

_Thus began the Age of Fire."_

  * The Age of Fire is the time when the Bearers of the Lord Souls ruled the world. It seems to be equated to the Golden Age of the World of Dark Souls. 

_"But soon the flames will fade and only Dark will remain."_

  * This Golden Age does not last and things start to go wrong. First the Flame starts to fade and the Lords look for a war to preserve the Age of Fire. Worried that an impending Age of Dark would mean disaster. 

_"The flames did fade, and only Dark remained._  
_Thus began the age of men, the Age of Dark._  
_However…_  
 _Lord Gwyn trembled at the Dark._  
_Clinging to his Age of Fire, and in dire fear of humans,_  
_and the Dark Lord who would one day be born amongst them,_  
_Lord Gwyn resisted the course of nature._  
_By sacrificing himself to link the fire, and commanding his children to shepherd the humans,_  
_Gwyn has blurred your past, to prevent the birth of the Dark Lord."_  
  

  * First the Witch of Izalith attempts to Create a First Flame of her own. Only to become consumed by it warping herself, her daughters, and the people of Izalith into Demons.

  * To rectify this Gwyn takes a contingent of his Knights to fight the threat of the Chaos Demons. He splits his soul between his family and allies he trusts. Seathe and the Four Kings of New Londo getting large fragments of Gwyn's Soul. After Gwyn does what he can in Izalith, he sets out to Relink the Flame. When Gwyn Relinks the Flame in the Kiln, he burns his Silver Knights to Ash and they wander the land as Black Knights.

  * After Gwyn's linking of the Flame, a number of things go Wrong in the Kingdom he tried to save. Oolacile's citizens are tricked into awakening Manus who's Humanity went Wild and created the Abyss. His Eldest is Stripped of his Deific Status and exiled. His Friend and advisor Seathe Goes Mad and Abducts people. The Four Kings he Trusted have been corrupted by a Primordial Serpent called Kaathe and became Dark Wraiths. Which Forced New Londo to be sealed and flooded to prevent them overruning everywhere else. A portion of Nito's power was stolen by the Necromancer Pinwheel. And Lastly humans that turned Undead have been seen as a scourge.

_"Even now there are only embers, and man sees not light, but only endless nights. And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed Darksign._

_Yes, indeed. The Darksign brands the Undead. And in this land, the Undead are corralled and led to the north, where they are locked away, to await the end of the world... This is your fate._

_Only, in the ancient legends it is stated, that one day an undead shall be chosen to leave the undead asylum, in pilgrimage, to the land of ancient lords, Lordran."_

  * This is the State of the world is in when the Chosen Undead is Freed from the Undead Asylum.

_"Well, what do we have here? You must be a new arrival.  
Let me guess. Fate of the Undead, right? Well, you're not the first.  
But there's no salvation here. You'd have done better to rot in the Undead Asylum… But, too late now.  
Well, since you're here… Let me help you out.  
There are actually two Bells of Awakening.  
One's up above, in the Undead Church. The other is far, far below, in the ruins at the base of Blighttown.  
Ring them both, and something happens… Brilliant, right?  
Not much to go on, but I have a feeling that won't stop you.  
So, off you go. It is why you came, isn't it? To this accursed land of the Undead?  
Hah hah hah hah…"_

  * The Chosen Undead's First Task is to ring 2 bells of awakening. It is cryptic on why but it gets explained later on.

_"Ahh, hello. Was it you who rang the Bell of Awakening?  
I am the Primordial Serpent, Kingseeker Frampt, close friend of the Great Lord Gwyn.  
Chosen Undead, who has rung the Bell of Awakening.  
I wish to elucidate your fate.  
  
_

_Chosen Undead. Your fate is… to succeed the Great Lord Gwyn.  
So that you may link the Fire, cast away the Dark, and undo the curse of the Undead.  
To this end, you must visit Anor Londo, and acquire the Lordvessel."_

  * The Chosen Undead is sent on another task, to fetch the Lordvessel. In Order to succeed Lord Gwyn in Linking the Fire.

_"O chosen Undead. I am Gwynevere._  
_Daughter of Lord Gwyn; and Queen of Sunlight. Since the day Father his form did obscureth, I have await'd thee._  
_I bequeath the Lordvessel to thee. And beseech thee._  
_Succeed Lord Gwyn, and inheriteth the Fire of our world._  
_Thou shall endeth this eternal twilight, and avert further Undead sacrifices."_

  * Upon receiving the Lord Vessel the Chosen Undead is told their sacrifice should prevent other Undead from needing to be sacrificed. The Chosen Undead is in need of Guidance on what to do with the Lordvessel.

_"Heavens! You have done it! You have retrieved the Lordvessel!_  
_After a thousand years! It is you, it is really you!_  
_…_  
 _This is the Firelink Chamber, for the successor of Lord Gwyn._

_To achieve your fate, fill the vessel with powerful souls,_  
_commensurate to the great soul of Gwyn._  
_Scarce few possess such brilliant souls._  
_Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith,_  
_the Four Kings of New Londo, who inherited the shards of Gwyn's soul…_  
 _and Lord Gwyn's former confidant, Seath the Scaleless._  
_All of their souls are required to satiate the lordvessel."_

  * Once again the Chosen Undead is given a Task to fill the Lord Vessel by slaying holders of the Lord Souls and Shards of a Lord Soul. 

_"The Lordvessel is satiated…_  
 _Magnificent… You are the righteous successor to Gwyn, the new Great Lord._  
_And I am Kingseeker no more…_  
 _Your acquaintance was an honour._  
_I must admit, I am fond of you humans._  
_May you enjoy serendipity,_  
_And may the Age of Fire perpetuate."_

  * Upon Satiating the Lordvessel you are recognized as a Monarch(this plays an important theme in Dark Souls 2) and you can now Fight Gwyn the Lord of CInder and Choose to either relink the Flame or Walk Away.

_"They failed me, every last one of them._  
_They were strong, but saw not the truth._  
_I am certain that you will prove different."_

  * Depending on the path you take to Gwyn you may encounter a different dialogue. One that hints at the lies being told to the Undead about relinking the Flame(Also expanded upon in Dark Souls 2).

* * *

## 3\. Dark Souls II Story

* * *

(Sometimes it is best to let a story tell itself.)

_"This is a limbo. A link between Drangleic and the outer world._  
_Fair traveller, I know that you must have a story._  
_Why else would you visit such a place?_  
_This lost, decayed kingdom."_

  * You start the game as an accursed undead, mysteriously transported to a place called things betwixt. Hollowing and lost you find yourself at a quiet little cabin with Old Ladies sitting in it. The Old Ladies give you a task bringing purpose to your hollowing mind.

_"An Undead has come to play. Heh heh…_  
 _They all end up here, all the ones like you._  
_You spoke to that kind old dear, didn't you?_  
_Heh heh…_  
 _You're finished._  
_You'll go Hollow._  
_Yes, you will become one of them._  
_Hollows prey upon men, feast upon their souls._  
_This is the fate of the cursed. Heh heh heh…_

_All people come here for the same reason.  
To break the curse.  
You're no different, I should think?  
Hmm… doesn't stand a chance.  
Well, you never know!  
Go through the door and trot along to the kingdom.  
But remember, hold on to your souls.  
They're all that keep you from going Hollow.  
Oh, I'll fool you no longer…  
You'll lose your souls…All of them. Over and over again_

_You must go, on a journey without rest.  
Well…I suppose, if you find yourself at an impasse…  
But if your will is yet unbroken, then you may return here.  
To start again, with a clean slate…  
Hah hah hah…"_

  * It is revealed that the Old Ladies were once Fire Keepers, by their Housekeeper.

_"The old women were keepers of the fire._  
_But now, the fire shows signs of fading…_  
 _And the kingdom…is beset by Hollows."_

  * Filled with purpose you set out into the Kingdom of Dragleic, searching for a cure of the curse. After traversing through the remains of an Archtree, you find yourself in a decrepit town called Majula where a Lone woman in Emerald is tending a bonfire. She Greets you with a question.

_"Are you...the next monarch?_  
_Or... Merely a pawn of fate?_  
_Bearer of the curse... I will remain by your side._  
_Till this frail hope shatters... Take this with you. May it ease your journey._  
_Go on, and see the King._  
_He who made Drangleic what it once was; he who peered at the essence of the soul._  
_King Vendrick."_

  * This question seems to parallel Frampt's search in Dark Souls 1. The Emerald Herald tasks you with a new mission.

 _"Bearer of the curse, seek misery._  
_For misery will lead you to greater, stronger souls._  
_You will never meet the King with a soul so frail and pallid._

_Seek those whose names are unutterable, the four endowed with immense souls._  
_Their souls will serve as beacons._  
_Once you have found them, return here to me._  
_So that hope will not fade away._

_Bearer of the curse... Seek souls. Larger, more powerful souls._  
_Seek the King, that is the only way._  
_Lest this land swallow you whole... As it has so many others."_

  * Before you leave town, others inform you on these unutterable ones.

_"There are four beings in this land with giant souls._  
_And wherever you go from here, you'll sooner or later come up against them._  
_Each has a powerful soul, and a terrible curse…_  
 _If that frightens you, then you ought to just give up right now. Like I have. Hah hah hah"_

_"Are you going to see the Old Ones?_  
_Those four who have grown so incredibly ancient._  
_They must have sprouted quite a thick coat of moss by now._  
_For heaven's sake, no-one even knows their names anymore!_  
_Imagine that! Hee hee hee hee!_  
_Yes…Nothing like yourself._  
_For you…have a most pleasant scent, that grows nicer with each passing day._

_Once, people tried to round up the Undead and hide them away from the world._  
_They thought that imprisoning the Undead would solve the problem._  
_They created a towering bastille to contain them, but in the end, it did no good._  
_The Lost Sinner lives deep within the bastille._  
_The fool. Trying to light the First Flame…_

_Why do people try so hard to be beautiful?_  
_We cats are born beautiful, of course. Hee hee…_  
 _The human ego…How many ugly iron castles has it erected?_  
_And they don't even see the folly of their ways._  
_But that's what makes watching humankind so delightful._  
_It reminds me of someone who lived long ago._  
_A vainglorious liar who ended up hurling himself into the flames._  
_Now he's Ichorous Earth, if I'm not mistaken._

_You've seen that gaping hole here?_  
_Well, there's nasty little vermin down there._  
_Although who you seek is even further below._  
_And has been down there for a very, very long time._  
_He's plumb Rotten by now, I'm sure! Hee hee hee…_

_Men develop the most peculiar fascinations._  
_Sometimes their fascinations seem to take control._  
_Till there's very little man left. Hee hee hee…_  
 _Oh, it's like that awful traitor long ago._  
_He coveted what he did not have, and it drove him mad._  
_What a curious conundrum. Hee hee hee…_  
 _The Writhing Ruin keeps searching as we speak._  
_Searching for its heart's desire."_

  * With rumors in hand and a direction to go you, seek out these four Great Souls. A mass of bodies in a poisoned gulch, an experimental spider in a bright cove, a forgotten prisoner in an abandoned prison, and a fallen king in a sinking lava filled castle. Upon Gathering the Final Soul You encounter a stranger. He implores you to continue your quest.

_"No one has come this far, not for a very long while._  
_Young Hollow do you wish to shed this curse?_  
_Then accept the fate of your ilk, and face the trials that await you._  
_Unless, you have already joined the crestfallen._

  
_Young Hollow, there are but two paths. Inherit the order of this world, or destroy it._  
_But only a true monarch can make such a choice._  
_Very few, indeed, have come even this far._  
_And yet, your journey is far from over._  
_Half-grown Hollow, have you what it takes, truly?_

  
_Young Hollow, seek after Vendrick._  
_He who almost became a true monarch._  
_Vendrick is certain to guide your way._  
_Fledgeling Hollow, may we meet again."_

  * Once you have gathered these four Great Souls a new path is opened to find the King. On your path to the castle you meet the Emerald Herald once again.

_"You have acquired the soul of an Old One._  
_That is more than most Undead can say._

_The soul and the curse are one and the same._  
_Your soul has grown stronger still._  
_I only hope it brings you what you wish._

_Proceed, bearer of the curse._  
_It is the only choice left to you._

_You are blessed with a myriad of souls._  
_Bearer of the curse, make your way to the castle._

_This castle is isolated._  
_But nonetheless, you must forge on._  
_To bring an end to your journey…and mine. End your journey…and mine."_

Upon entering the castle you are greeted by a confused shade.

_"Who are you…_  
 _And by whose permission do you stand before me?_  
_This castle is the domain of King Vendrick. Is your trespass intentional?_  
_…_  
 _His Highness…Where has he gone?___

_You are a guest of our castle. I am the Chancellor, Wellager._  
_Do you seek an audience with my Lord, King Vendrick?_  
_Unfortunately, His Highness is absent._  
_My Lord…The King has…_  
 _The Queen…Has taken him…_

  
_My Lord made magnificent findings on souls… An accomplishment for the ages…_  
 _He vanquished the Four Great Ones… And built this kingdom upon their souls._  
_Our King has watched over this land… Since ages long, long ago…_  
 _King Vendrick…We must fight back… Or the Giants will take Drangleic…_

  
_The King had a dear Queen, a woman of unparalleled beauty._  
_Long ago, the Queen came to us, alone, from a faraway land._  
_She warned our Lord of the looming threat across the seas…of the Giants._  
_The King crossed the ocean… And defeated the Giants, with the Queen at his side._

  
_The King commandeered their power… And created the Golems._  
_With the Golems, the king created this castle._  
_To celebrate victory… And to show his love, his gratitude to his Queen…_

  
_The Queen…Brought peace… to this land, and to her King._  
_A peace so deep…it was like…_  
 _The Dark…_

  
_Is this…some sort of a dream?_  
_……_  
 _Where am I? What has happened to our castle…_  
 _Who are you…_  
 _And by whose permission do you stand before me?"_

As you venture further in the Castle you encounter the Queen of Drangleic, Nashandra.

_"You have fought admirably on your journey, cursed Undead._  
_I am Nashandra, Queen of Drangleic._  
_A true monarch carries the weight of their souls._  
_The last king of this land, King Vendrick, as he was called…_  
 _He was less of a king than you might imagine._  
_He found the strength to rule his people, and when the Undead were born, cursed…_  
 _He found more strength, to face them._  
_But in the end, he never took the true throne._

_Visit Vendrick._  
_We have no need for two rulers…"_

  * Once again you meet A Stranger who has a monstrous appearance.

_"Heheh, I believe we've been acquainted._  
_Young Hollow, conqueror of fear._  
_What drives you so, to overcome this supposed curse?_

_Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession._  
_Some are true to their purpose, though they are but shells, flesh and mind._  
_One man lost his own body, but lingered on, as a head._  
_Others chase the charms of love, however elusive._  
_What is it that drives you?_

_Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity._  
_And men assumed a fleeting form._  
_These are the roots of our world._  
_Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite..._  
_A lie will remain a lie._  
_Young Hollow, knowing this, do you still desire peace?"_

  * He summarizes many of the NPCs storylines and even hints at how the Chosen Undead was Lied to. Then he proceeds to question your task, before leaving.

_" Vendrick, the near-true monarch, is here, and not far off._  
_But what is a king?_  
_You, neither born with greatness, nor granted it by the fates._  
_What is it that you seek?_  
_You cannot even say yourself._  
_We shall meet again, young Hollow."_

  * Upon Entering the Undead Crypt you are beseeched by a Grave Warden. 

_" Halt._  
_Human. Do not produce light._  
_Light, and all those who bear it, are unwelcome in this place._

_I am Agdayne. Guardian of the crypt._  
_Countless dead rest here in peace. Cradled by the comfort of dark._  
_Light only agitates. We have no need for it here._

_I am a Fenito. We weave death, and watch over the dead._  
_This task was granted to me by the one who gave us the first death._  
_Countless souls rest here. Some of them from ages long ago._  
_Some were rich, others poor. Some wise, some dull, but now, they are all just dead._

_This place is welcome to all, provided due reverence is shown.  
Death is equitable, accepting. We will all, one day, be welcomed by her embrace.  
Tell me what you desire. Show me reverence, and I will lend you my hand._

_In the past, humans were one with the dark.  
The former King of Light…He feared humans. Feared that they would usher in an age of dark.  
How queer, you humans. How you go on, never separating truth from fiction._

_Did you come for him? The one called Vendrick._  
_You will find him deeper inside._  
_Many castle servants and the like have come to fetch their lord._  
_But they rest here now, put to death by the King's own guards._  
_Perhaps he's not in the mood for company.__"_

  * Further in you finally meet Vendrick who has hollowed. It us up to you to either Slay him and or take his ring. Upon Leaving the Grave Warden mentions.

_"You've met the King, have you?_  
_Life is never easy, never fair. Even more so, on this path you've chosen._  
_May you find your peace one day"_

  * As you retrace your footsteps, you find yourself once again in Queen Nashandra's Presence.

_"Brave Undead, seek the throne._  
_Follow the symbol of the monarch, and do what must be done."_

  * If you stop and speak to the Emerald Herald She tells you.

_"This ring is the symbol of the King._  
_Use it to gain passage, through the King's Gate… …and venture to the far east…_  
 _Bearer of the curse, if you are to be the next monarch._  
_Then, one day, you will walk those grounds… …without really knowing why."_

  * With a new quest in hand you seek out the symbols of the king. You find yourself in front of a Large Keep. In this Keep You see that many experiments have taken place here and even encounter a caged Dragon. You find yourself heading up an elevator into a a place filled with flying Dragons. There you encounter the Emerald Herald.

_"Bearer of the curse._  
_Long have I awaited one such as you, one who might shatter the shackles of fate._  
_One who can set me free._  
_Bearer of the curse, it was my own manifestation that led you here._  
_The ancient dragon has watched over the world for aeons past._  
_Take this. Do not resist. The dragon welcomes you."_

  * The Emerald Herald Gives you an Aged Feather as a Gift. You tread further into this Dragon Aerie and cross a rope bridge. At the Bonfire in what is called the Dragon Shrine you encounter the Stranger once again.

_"Young Hollow._  
_How you grapple, without falter, with this dreadfully twisted world._

_Peace grants men the illusion of life._  
_Shackled by falsehoods, they yearn for love, unaware of its grand illusion._  
_Until, the curse touches their flesh._  
_We are bound by this yoke._  
_As true as the Dark that churns within men._

_All men trust fully the illusion of life._  
_But is this so wrong?_  
_A construction, a facade, and yet..._  
_A world full of warmth and resplendence._  
_Young Hollow, are you intent on shattering the yoke, spoiling this wonderful falsehood?_

_..._

_I am Aldia._  
_I sought to shed the yoke of fate, but failed._  
_Now, I only await an answer._  
_Seek the throne._  
_Seek light, Dark and what lies beyond..."_

  * Further on in the Shrine you encounter the Ancient Dragon. Who gifts you with the Ashen Mist Heart, allowing you to interact with the memories of the hollowed or departed.

_"The murk shifts and stirs._  
_Yet another stands before us…_  
 _Then so be it._  
_For the curse of life, is the curse of want._  
_And so, you peer…_  
 _Into the fog, in hope of answers."_

__

_If you see the Queen after the Ancient Dragon. She tells you,_

_"Brave Undead, what did that dragon tell you?_  
_That thing is a prop, a false deity. Don't be fooled, my Undead._

_Seek the forest, you, where those wretched Giants slumber."_

  * Following Aldia's, Nashandra's and the Ancient Dragons Advice you seek out the memories of the Giants and Vendrick. The Giant's show the devastation they wrought on Drangleic, While Vendrick's memories allow you to understand him.

_"Seeker of fire, coveter of the throne._  
_I am Vendrick, ruler of Drangleic._

_I am no king. I am more fit to be a jester…  
I was unaware of my own blindness.  
We are feeble vessels, with feebler souls.  
We would cast aside the prop of life, only to face greater hardship.  
Are you another such fool, or something more?_

_Seeker of fire, deliverer of crowns._  
_What do you see in the flames?_  
_Find the crowns, and your own answers._  
_The crowns hold the strength of lords from time long past._  
_Seek adversity._  
_As befits you, seeker of fire, coveter of the throne._

_I fail to see your design, young moth._  
_But I see very little, these days…"_

  * With a new task in hand it is time to seek out the other fallen kings and their crowns. Once you have Acquired the Crown's from the fallen Monarch's Vendrick will Give you his Blessing after he gives you his insight.

_"Seeker of fire, conqueror of Dark._  
_I, too, sought fire, once._  
_With fire, they say, a true king can harness the curse._  
_A lie. But I knew no better…_  
 _Seeker of fire, you know not the depths of Dark within you._  
_It grows deeper still, the more flame you covet._  
_Flame, oh, flame…_

_I am king of this wretched, unravelled kingdom._  
_I subdued the Giants, and claimed their strength._  
_So that I might step closer to fire…_  
 _Drangleic will fall, the fire will fade, and the souls of old will reemerge._  
_With Dark unshackled, a curse will be upon us…_  
 _And men will take their true shape…_

_Seeker of fire, I see you've subdued another foul creature._  
_One of the Father of the Abyss' spawn, that confounded quintessence of humanity._  
_The Abyss once had form, but then dissipated._  
_And yet, traces of its existence endured._  
_Each fragment, thirsting for power, spread Dark, with no relent._  
_My dear Shandra… was one such fragment…_  
 _A feeble, tiny thing that thirsted for power more than any other…_  
 _Driven by insatiable lust for a worthy vessel._

_Fire came to be, and with it, Disparity._  
_Heat and cold, life and death, Light and Dark._  
_Dark was seen as a curse._  
_Shadow is not cast, but born of fire._  
_And, the brighter the flame, the deeper the shadow._  
_Inherit fire, and harness the Dark._  
_Such is the calling of a true leader…_

_One day, fire will fade, and Dark will become a curse._  
_Men will be free from death, left to wander eternally._  
_Dark will again be ours, and in our true shape…_  
 _We can bury the false legends of yore… Only…_  
 _Is this our only choice?_

#### [Gods of Drangleic](/Gods+of+Drangleic "Dark Souls 2 Gods of Drangleic")

  
In  _Dark Souls II_ , there seems to be a lot more mention of specific gods through gear, covenants, and magics. These are all subject to change but we know now the name of some. These names and roles are all subject to change, but many of the names of the various Gods can be found in using the [Name-engraved Ring](/Name-engraved+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Name-engraved Ring").

  * **Caffrey - Goddess of Fortune**

It is possible that her image, or a predecessor of hers, is the angel-winged woman who appears on the [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin"), which grants the player additional luck.

  * **Caitha - Goddess of Tears**

Mentioned in [Caitha's Chime,](/Caitha%27s+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Caitha%27s Chime") as either a compassionate being or a demoness presiding over tragedy.

  * **Evlana - Goddess of the Hunt**

Evlana is the the patron deity of those who stalk and kill their prey. However according to the Hunter's Bow she was not in reality a true Goddess but in fact was such an impressive huntress in her long forgotten age that stories of her now have raised her to God status.

  * **Faraam - God of War**

Faraam's name appears on the armor set that is the flagship armor set of the Chosen Undead in _Dark Souls II_. The armor from the description is said to be blessed by the war god Faraam and worn by the Lion Knights of Forossa.

  * **Galib - God of Disease**

God of disease worshipped by Leydia witches described in the Leydia Black set armor.

  * **Nahr Alma - God of Blood**

Narh Alma is the name of the patron god of the _Dark Souls II_ invader covenant which looks to function very similarly to the darkwraiths from _Dark Souls_. He is mentioned by the small creature Titchy Gren who you find near the bonfire after clearing the executioner's chariot boss battle. Titchy Gren accepts you into the covenant and gives you a ring and seems to be obsessed with blood as we assume Nahr Alma is. Titchy Gren will not talk to you unless you have invaded and killed someone. Titchy Gren will not accept you nor speak with you if you are in the Heirs of the Sun covenant.   
_Note* ALMA is Latin for nourishing or to nourish. For example: ALMA MATER means nourishing mother. ALMA can also mean kind or soul, but there is no indication of a possible Latin connection to Dark Souls II. Nahr is also a Romanisation of the Arabic word for 'river' نهر, from a Semitic root N-H-R, so Nahr Alma could be taken to literally mean 'nourishing river', an apt metaphor for blood._

  * **Quella - God of Dream**

Is mentioned in the [Spirit Tree Shield](/Spirit+Tree+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Spirit Tree Shield"), [Grand Spirit Tree Shield](/Grand+Spirit+Tree+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Grand Spirit Tree Shield") and [White Ring](/White+Ring "Dark Souls 2 White Ring"). Apparently, he is represented by a talking tree. He seems to reside in a place called the dreamworld and has dominion over dreams.

  * **Zandroe - God of Greed**

Zandroe is mentioned in the item description of the Silver Serpent Ring “A silver ring depicting the snake, both the servant and the manifestation of the god of greed, Zandroe." Zandroe is not, however, mentioned in the [Name-engraved Ring](/Name-engraved+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Name-engraved Ring"). In Dark Souls I the Silver Serpent Ring's description reads "The serpent is an imperfect dragon and symbol of the Undead. Its habit of devouring prey even larger than itself has led to an association of gluttony." This suggest that the "God" Zandroe could possibly be a twisted variation on a concept of an imperfect dragon. (Gaping Dragon?)

  * **Zinder - God of Desire**

Similar to Zandroe, Zinder is mentioned in the item description of the Gold Serpent Ring “A gold ring depicting the snake, both the servant and the manifestation of the god of desire, Zinder. Greed is traditionally viewed as a vice, but only a coward sees every chance as something to fear.” The description of the Gold Serpent Ring in Dark Souls I reads “The serpent is an imperfect dragon and symbol of the Undead. Its habit of devouring prey even larger than itself has led to an association of gluttony." Exactly the same as the Silver Serpent Ring. This suggest that perhaps Zandroe and Zinder are one in the same, both twisted concepts of greed surrounding an imperfect dragon, or serpent.   
  
**_There is _little to no_ information on Hanleth - Goddess of Bliss, Kremmel - God of Struggle, or Nehma - Goddess of Love at this time, but their names are mentioned by use of the name engraved ring._**

## **6\. Theories and Speculation**

* * *

  
It is mentioned by Straid of Olaphis, after you unpetrify him, that the land was not called Drangleic before he was petrified and had other names before the one he knew. The different descriptions of the Lingering Dragoncrest Ring in Dark Souls and Dark Souls II suggest that Drangleic could be Vinheim, if Vinheim is a land or kingdom and not just a region within the land. In Dark Souls, the ring is described as being given to accomplished students at the Vinheim Dragon school, where as in Dark Souls II, it is said to have been used "a long, long time ago in a land where Drangleic is now". This could be interpreted that the ring in Drangleic is one of the very same used in Lordran, or that it is a ring it its land of origin.   
There are also references to legends of Giants who came across the sea, fearing humans who might bring about an age of dark, but were defeated by King Vendrick. These Giants could be the followers of Lord Gwyn, as the player encounters bosses such as Old Dragonslayer. It was revealed by Chancellor Wellager that the Giants attacked Drangleic because King Vendrick had invaded their land and stole something precious from them at the request of Queen Nashandra. Wellager also states that the Queen came from a faraway land across the sea, though it isn't said exactly where she came from, or if it was the same land as the Giants. Chencellor Wellager also mentions that after the war was over, the Queen "brought peace to her king", and that it was "almost like.. the Dark". The Soul of Nashandra says that she was born of the dark, and there are hints she may have been created from a greater evil that lurked within the Abyss.   
Vinheim- "Heim" meaning home, possibly "Home of Vendrick"   
In the Undead Crypt, the Grave Warden Agdayne talks of a human being one with the darkness. From the turn of events in Dark Souls we can speculate what effects the darkness had on the overall world. He speaks of a "Former King of Light" that feared humans, thinking they'd "Usher in a new age of dark". This could be either before Drangleic was Drangleic or before Vendrick took the throne as king. This could be pointing that Dark Souls II is in the same place as Dark Souls due to having the same items spread about and the Former King was Gwyn.

In the afore mentioned Lore Analysis, it states that the the giants from Dark Souls 1 are different then those from 2. HOWEVER, The Iron Golem, which appears in DS1, has enough similarity, the hole in it's chest being the strongest piece of evidence, that links it with the GOLEMS in DS2 that were created by use of the defeated Giants. Theory on this is that either a Golem from Drangleic was transported to Lordran....or possibly the Giants/Golems are unaffected by the rekindling of the Age of Fire?   
(addition) The giants of Dark Souls 2 are far different than that of the original. From what we can see from Gods to NPCs in Dark Souls that their variants of giants are sentient, intelligent being that achieved god-like status using the Light Souls of Gwyn. These giants are likely extinct in this new age as many were killed off during wars and the fading of the first flame. However, they did have the methods to create artificial life in the form of golems. Golems in mythology become sentient and more independent in time, perhaps they could be smart enough to form basic governing systems (this considering, of course, the mythology of Dark Souls follows the myth of our world)? It has been millenia since the original giants were common, the men of Drangleic called them giants on account of their size. Of course these giants are nothing compared to the originals, being far less intelligent and seem to only have a basic grasp of creation (the Giant Lord has the most advanced weapon, a crude sword) and the rest fight with clubs or their bare hands. Perhaps the "kinship of giants" is an artifact from the age of original giants and the giants are nothing more than a race of semi-sentient golems who form a united force in order to protect said artifact. When Vendrick stole the kinship he instantly took away their ability to form more giants, they probably invaded in order to save their people from extinction. ||   
||= The four Primal bosses that you must kill in the first half of the game could possibly be reincarnations of 4 characters from Dark Souls 2. Sweet Shalquior mentions in her dialogue that the Primals are incredibly ancient, and that they remind her of others from a time long ago. In NG+ the 4 Primal Bosses drop unique Souls that give hints to their origins. The Lost Sinner drops the Old Witch Soul, implying that the Lost Sinner inherited the Soul of the Witch of Izalith. The Duke's Dear Freja (Freja is not a Primal, you get the soul from the dragon in the roof.) drops the Old Paledrake Soul This suggests that the Duke might have discovered the deformed Everlasting Dragon Seath the Scaleless' Soul and created Freja from it. The Iron King drops the Old King Soul, which implies he inherited the Soul of the Sun God Lord Gwyn (or maybe from one of four kings, the old king sucumbed to his own ego and hunger of power as the four kings did before). Finally The Rotten drops the Old Dead One's Soul, implying that he inherited Lord Nito's Soul. The Primal Bosses also share many personality traits and flaws from the original primordial beings. This suggests that the Souls of these beings are so powerful that even after death they reincarnate and become weaker, but still very powerful, monstrosities. Finally, the Furtive Pygmy Manus was split into fragments and Nashandra was formed from the smallest of these pieces, as described in the description of the [Chime of Want](/Chime+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Chime of Want"). This also suggests that there are more beings who are reincarnations of Manus scattered throughout the world.   
Sublime Bone Dust could very well be the remains of the Chosen Undead from Dark Souls I. The bone dust description claims that this dust comes from "A Saint who cast himself upon the fires". This could mean that the Rekindle the Bonfire ending is canon, though it is unknown how many times the fires that been rekindled and faded since the first game.   
There are many similarities and connections when looking at Lordran and the lost kingdom of Heide. The Tower of Heide and the Blue Cathedral especially share near perfect copies of the architecture in Anor Londo. The cathedral also holds home to the Old Dragonslayer, a near identical match to Orstein the Dragonslayer from Dark Souls I. Heide Knights also wield weapons that use lightening and the Sun Covenant survived in some form here. Heide could perhaps be a kingdom that was formed by the Gods who escaped the fall of Lordran and Gwyn when the flame first faded. It is known that Gwyn's daughter Gwynevere and her husband Flann were part of this exodus. Flann was the God of Fire, which could explain why a large lighthouse is built on the site of Heide Tower. Gwynevere is also the Daughter of Sunlight, which could explain how many of sunlight based miracles and items got here. This could mean that Heide was a kingdom that was created by these 2 gods in order to try and replicate the former glory of Anor Londo, though some unknown force destroyed the kingdom and it sunk into the sea.   
The Lost Bastille is where undead were rounded up and imprisoned, similar to the Undead Asylum from the first game. One of the things noticeable there are these jar like cells vaguely shaped like humans. Some are normal sized, some large. There are even small sized, implying that children can be branded with the dark sign and thus become undead.    
The giants that are talked about and/or shown in Dark Souls 2 may NOT be the same type of giants in the first game, or perhaps, may be a variant of the ones from the first game that have evolved to the point that they did not require faces. Point in facts being not only the Giant Blacksmith and such, but in the Tomb of the Giants. The giant skeletons clearly are shown to have faces. So this means one of 2 possible theories, either giants have evolved to the point where they no longer required sustenance, due to not having faces....or this is a different evolutionary breed of giants, possibly acting as the golems did to King Vendrick, to where ever they're hivemind controller is located, not too dissimilar to the Geth from Mass Effect   
In the description of Dragon Bone Fist from Dark Souls 1, it is said that the Gods had the ability to create Golems by "fusing the power of souls" with an inanimate object. In Dark Souls 2, the Golems are also powered by absorbing souls, suggesting that whatever Vendrick stole allowed him to perform this long-lost fusion technique. It is possible that this may have had the potential to free humanity from the Undead Curse by creating a new artificial race, but perhaps that ended with the Emerald Herald.   
In Dark Souls 1 there is no trace of possible masochistic behaviours in the Witch of Izalith, behaviours that the Lost Sinner obviously shows. The nature of his self-punishment in my opinion can't be explained with connections with the Lord's Soul she carries. I tried to understand why this character feels so guilty. Sweet Shalquior tells us that she tried to light the First Flame again, like the Witch of Izalith did. Maybe she tried in the same way, with pyromancy (She never uses it, but her gauntlets are useful to it). The Chaos Demon we see in her presentation suggests that she tried to light the Flame in the same way. I think she failed in her attempts because there are no Chaos Demons in Drangleic or in the outer world except this one. Anyway, she tried, and something bad should happen. Here's my theory: what if the tower of Flame of Heide was not built with the purpose to be a lighthouse? Maybe the Lost Sinner was a pyromancer of Heide, who tried to create the First Flame in her city, but something went wrong and she only destroyed the town (In my opinion Heide doesn't seem fallen underwater in a natural way). Maybe the Chaos Bug we see with her is the only Chaos Demon her attempt produced, or the last Demon remained from Dark Souls 1 that suggested her what to do.   
I think after the Lost Sinners understood what she did, she ran away from Heide to the Lost Bastille, maybe creating in her fury the path from Heide to No Man's Wharf (it doesn't seem natural too). Then she locked herself in Sinner's Rise and decided not to use pyromancy anymore. The Chaos Bug in this way should represent her conscience of what she did, and for this she screams when it enters in her mask (she sees it and think to her sin).   
Many people believe that the Ancient Dragon in the Dragons Aerie is that of Aldia who succeeded in turning himself into a dragon, however, this theory deduces that mayhaps he could not do so 100 percent successfully, or mayhaps could not transfer his FULL soul into the dragon, and transferred at least part of his soul/conciousness into Navlaan. The method behind this is that you originally find him in Aldia's keep, after that, the places where he will invade you are similar to where you would think Aldia traveled to and from, in order to achieve materials for his experimentation. Forest of the Fallen Giants for the giant bodies, The Gutter for human bodies and possibly of the dragon bones located before The Rotten boss fight, Brightstone for the crystals more then likely used in many of his magic rituals and elixirs, and Drangleic Castle and Aldia's Keep due to being part of the royal family, King Vendrick's older brother. The last two could be argued that that's because Navlaan was/is a royal sorcerer, but the rest would make very little sense, even IF his other personality is a bit crazy.   
As of the release of [Scholar of the First Sin](/Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin"), Aldia's real identity has been confirmed.   
People think the location with the undead singers is Ash Lake, but this theory focuses on that possibly Things Betwixt is actually Ash Lake. Ash Lake was in the first game, the only location still in relative similar appearance to what the world looked like before the First Flame, and seemed to be nothing but an almost endless ocean. That being said, Things Betwixt is the most similar in this appearance, though quiet a big darker in appearance, though that could be said in ANOTHER theory that possibly the closer to the end of an Age of Fire it gets, the darker the world seems to be, and that that could possibly be why Things Betwixt was so much darker in the second game than in the first game.

###  **The Iron King and The Lost Sinner's Love affair.**

Mytha and The Iron King were most likely married. However, something came between them that drove Mytha to do crazy acts of love for her husbands attention.   
  
_"that creature, she was human once ya know... Hmm, In fact, she was wed to the prince of that nearby castle... But her husband, hmm, he had feelings for another... before long the princess' ire transformed her into a monster."_ \- Laddersmith Gilligan   
  
  
So we know the king had someone else. This is important because of how she turned...   
  
The next important factor here, is in the whole game, there are only 2 named demons; The Smelter demon and the Covetous demon. We know demons were made at Lost Izalith when trying to relight the flame failed. So was the Iron Keep above Lost Izalith? I believe so, because right next door to Lost Izalith and the pools of lava is Blight Town.(The Bed of Chaos is long gone, the demons in this game appear to be more or less some form of experiment gone wrong or someone using dark magics to warp themselves into something less than human) It makes sense that when the Iron King mined underground, so did the people of Harvest Valley and Earthen Peak, but the people got a very different result...   
  
Even Stone Trader Chloanne explains how there is nothing of interest at Harvest Valley (will add quote at later date). so why are they mining? (They had a full blown Kingdom, perhaps they got the ore from somewhere else.)   
  
The Covetous demon I believe to be a typical love story. He clearly loves Mytha, even being a monster, he too would do anything crazy to get her attention. Covetous meaning - "having or showing a great desire to possess something belonging to someone else." clearly supports this idea. (The Covetous Demon's Soul description implies that he may have been once human, only to be warped. It is unknown how the   
  
Why would Mytha take something from her mines, maybe knowing it being poisonous, just to get the attention of her husband The Iron King? Maybe The Iron King found something to obsess over in his mine...   
  
The Lost Sinner (not going into too much speculation who it actually is) has the soul of the Witch of Izalith and tried to rekindle the first flame. All the old souls suggest that they have a way to persuade the one who acquired it. Is is possible the Iron King, with the Lost Sinner tried once again to re-make the first flame? once again causing the birth of demons?   
  
So why the Lost Sinner you might ask... well the door in the Lost Sinner's cell is the same you see in the Iron Keep... It strongly suggests the Iron King made her cell for her. Not to mention the Iron literally everywhere around sinner's cell, including one of the only places where fire is used mechanically (when you light up the rooms from the side rooms) like in the Iron Keep. The Lost Sinners Mask is even made completely out of iron.   
  
_"the Lost Sinner eternally punishes herself for the sins of her past. Indeed, she committed what some would believe to be the ultimate sin - she attempted to relight the First Flame."_ \- Lost Sinner Description   
  
The wording here suggests she actually imprisoned herself. "Some" also suggests that someone doesn't believe it to be the worst sin, maybe that someone was the Iron King?   
  
**Opinion -** To me, she feels guilty herself and thus hides herself away knowing what she did was wrong. The Iron King however might not have agreed but out of loved helped. He gives her a large sword to protect herself and throws away the (Bastille) Key so that no one can light the room for her fully. locked her hands together so she couldn't use Pyromancy without burning herself (note: when the player wears them we only wear them on one hand).   
  
**Bell Keepers -** The belfry gargoyls and the bell brothers get an explination for there purpose then. the gorgoyles were made by the Iron King who is explained to be able to make life from Iron, but maybe not just iron, maybe from stone too, or maybe the Iron King and the Lost Sinner shared this ability. The Bell Keepers defend Belfry Luna and Sol, so they're connected to the Iron Keep for some reason.   
  
Need more evidence?   
  
"_The twin bells symbolize the love between two lovers who could never be united. The bell keepers are their eternal guardians. For that is their love, that is their curse."_ \- Bell Keepers Ring   
  
The Iron King made the Bell of Sol, the Lost Sinner made the Bell of Luna using iron and resources from the Iron King... so the Iron King is Prince of Alken and the Lost Sinner is the Princess of Venn. This explains why the Iron King is sometimes called a Prince, it was when the Iron King wasn't ruler yet.   
  
_"Keep your hands off our bell, the great bell of Alken. The bell belongs to the princess it do."_ \- Bell Keeper in Luna   
  
_"A long, long, long time ago, the princess, she made me, yes, just like so. to guard this bell for the prince's honor"_ \- Bell Keeper in Luna   
  
_"The prince made me, to guard the bell of Venn."_ \- Bell Keeper in Sol   
  
So knowing that the Iron King can make Iron creatures come to life from the various armor sets in his keep, it makes sense the Iron King was once the Prince of Alken.   
  
So is the Lost Sinner the Princess of Venn? the Iron and such all around her connects them. The bug also connected her to Izalith that could be under the Iron Keep. Another factor is her soul "sins of her past", so not only did she try and relight the first flame but she did other things she feels guilty over. The Lost Sinners Sword even mentions she doesn't know its true nature or where it's from, is that because the Iron King gave it to her. The Chaos Blade from Dark Souls 1 was made from the soul of Quelaag, it too hurt the player on hitting an enemy.   
  
While it doesn't make it obvious like the Iron King, it's very likely the Lost Sinner is the Princess of Venn. She is not a witch of Izalith or the bed of chaos... they died... but 1 was unaccounted for... her soul however does change the fate of the owner and it's probably what the Prince and Princess tried to do together.   
  
**The attempt to relight the flame:**   
At this point, while it's only assumption, it seems fair to say the Iron King and the Lost Sinner tried together to relight the first flame. The attempted failed, recreating the disaster like before. The Iron King was killed by the Smelter Demon and was turned into the beast we see in-game. The Lost Sinner, like some of the witches of Izalith, got away safely, but in guilt of her sins locked herself away. Or she could have been willingly captured and sent to the cell made in sinners rise. While the cell might not have originally been for her, she fitted it nicely with the moon (Luna) reminding us of her bell.   
  
to explain Mytha and Covetous properly I've waited till the end. Mytha was crazy in love, and like her husband did, she mined the ground and looked for something of interesting like the Lost Sinner clearly had under the Iron Keep. She found poison. Covetous followed Mytha's crazy idea and ate as much as he could to impress Mytha. Mytha might have just been using Covetous to try and make the Iron King guilty at some point...   
Covetous turned into a demon from the poison he consumed and never found true love...   
  
Mytha was forever jealous of the Princess of Venn   
  
The King of Alken, the Iron King, lost his true love. losing his human form to a monster he could never search for her again.   
  
The Princess of Venn, the Lost Sinner, feeling guilty punished herself and never tried to escape.   
  
  
\- Written by Bubushum, any feedback or suggestions would be nice. I will edit this later to fix spelling, grammar, and overall layout.   
Thank you for reading!

* * *

  * Just an added observation on the relationship between Alken and Venn. The ring of Blades description states that both kingdoms were founded by the same man but later reduced to rivalry. Hmmm.... So, it stands to reason that Alken and Venn were founded by the prince and princess' father. A king prior to Vendrick divided his kingdom between his son and daughter. So that would explain why their love was so forbidden. The pair created the bell keepers instead of children because everybody knows sibling coupling is a no-no. It wasn't because Alken already had Mytha or anything like that, it was their parentage that kept them from being able to "ring the bell" if you catch the reference. Mytha, jilted, turned her fury and her kingdom against Venn, most likely after Alken (the person) died. The only thing I find odd is the whole "nobody remembering the Sinner's name", one would think you could remember the person's name if their's and the kingdom's were one and the same. So perhaps I'm wrong and Venn was another prince and since Alken and the princess of Venn were both already married they couldn't be together. But then why would the bell be named after Venn? Nope, I'm sticking with the sibling theory. Too much evidence to ignore. -cursedroninzero
