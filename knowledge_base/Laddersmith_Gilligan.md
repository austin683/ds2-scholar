**Laddersmith Gilligan** is an [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") [Merchant](/Merchants "Dark Souls 2 Merchants") in **Dark Souls 2. Laddersmith Gilligan** can be encountered in various locations throughout the game, starting in the [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak"). He is a skilled craftsman specializing in the construction and repair of ladders. Gilligan offers his services to the player, allowing them to purchase ladders of various lengths to access new areas and shortcuts. Despite his usefulness, Gilligan is a somewhat untrustworthy character, often asking for exorbitant fees for his services and displaying a selfish and mercenary attitude. 

### Laddersmith Gilligan Information in Dark Souls 2

  * A merchant on the run that specializes in the art of ladders and a love for profit and currency wherever possible.
  * [Blacksmith Lenigrast](/Blacksmith+Lenigrast "Dark Souls 2 Blacksmith Lenigrast") comments on the fact that Gilligan its a scoundrel in his hometown, having caused major stirring of troubles to the people. He calls him a scum and a conniver when it comes to money, but helpful, only when he gains something in return, that is. We are uncertain if Gilligan lived in the same town as Lenigrast or if he simply resided there to hide from more people that were chasing him.
  * Located initially at [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak"). However he will move to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), either after exhausting his dialogue at his first encounter or by killing the boss [Mytha, the Baneful Queen](/Mytha,+the+Baneful+Queen "Dark Souls 2 Mytha, the Baneful Queen").

  * At both locations, he will ask your service of souls for building ladders to reach treasures.
  * At [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") he has a unique dialogue option called "Set up Ladder".  
This talk option allows you to set up three different ladders of various lengths and prices to descend into the Pit to easily reach the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") and [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter").
  * The cheapest ladder costs 500 souls, the second costs 3500 souls, and the longest one costs 12000 souls.
  * The cheapest ladder will only go half way down to the first plank, but it could be all you need if you have high health, or very low health while wearing the cat ring.
  * The second most expensive ladder will take you down to near the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") entrance. From there, you can drop down a few more levels to a platform just outside the bonfire at the start of [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints").(Note: You are still going to need a lot of HP or the Silvercat Ring (or other fall damage reduction items) to reach the entrance.) A separate "drop path" will put you on a different platform at the bottom of a ladder.
  * The most expensive ladder gives you easy access to the Forgotten Door, far down in the pit. The key to the door is found in a hidden cave in the [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch").
  * Note that you cant climb up the first and second ladder again.
  * Talk to him after buying the most expensive ladder to receive the Melu Scimitar (achievement)

### Laddersmith Gilligan Encounters in Dark Souls 2

  * [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak"). Found near the **Central Earthen Peak** bonfire. Walk upstairs and pass though the door to the balcony with the [Manikin](/Manikin "Dark Souls 2 Manikin"). Destroy the wooden balustrade and go left. He will offer you a ladder for 2,000 souls in order to get a treasure ([Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros'+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone") and [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")).
  * [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). Found sitting next to the Pit in Majula. You don't need to speak to him in Earthen Peak in order for him to move to Majula. He will simply travel there after you kill [Mytha, the Baneful Queen](/Mytha,+the+Baneful+Queen "Dark Souls 2 Mytha, the Baneful Queen"). If this happens, you can still collect the above loot by dropping down (the falling height is quite short), along with a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone") or [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") to safely return back.

…I'll let you off, this once…

**\- Answer "yes"**  
…All right, it'll be just a moment…

**\- Answer "no"**  
…Hell, of course it's not free!

**\- Talking to after declining services**  
…What? You don't have a choice, do you!  
…Then, let's have it! Show me your finest…

**\- Revisiting after purchasing ladder in Earthen Peak**  
…Oh, what is it? What do you need now?

**\- Using talk option (Earthen Peak menu)**  
…Psst, have you heard?  
…Well, apparently there's this monster lady, right…  
…And the poison, well, does wonders for her body…  
…You know, health and beauty, and that sort of stuff…  
…And I thought only human women were so petty!

**\- Using talk option (Earthen Peak menu)**  
…That creature, she was human, once, you know…  
…Hmm, In fact, she was wed to the Prince of that nearby castle…  
…But her husband, hmm, he had feelings for another…  
…The Princess was desperate, and sought eternal beauty…  
…Hoping that it would restore the Prince's, ah, affection, ha you see what I mean…

**\- Using talk option (Earthen Peak menu)**  
…Before long, the Princess' ire transformed her into a monster…  
…Now listen here. When do you think this all happened?  
…Long ago, when this very land was called something else…

**\- Using talk option (Earthen Peak menu**)  
…Gods almighty…

**\- Leaving after accepting further service (Earthen Peak)**  
…No mate, these deals, they won't last forever…

**\- Leaving without seeking further service (Earthen Peak)**  
…Fine, then, all the best…

**\- Leaving without closing menu (Earthen Peak)**  
…Oi! Downright rude, really…

**\- First encounter in Majula**  
Wait, you found your way out, too! Hah!  
The name's Gilligan. Don't make me say it twice! Heh heh.  
All right, what do you want?  
I have everything you need! Heh heh heh…

**\- Revisiting in Majula**  
Ah! Back already? Ha.  
(_or_)  
Hey, what've you been up to!  
(_or_)  
Come to see auld Gilligan, have you? Hah! (_after purchasing ladder_)  
(_or_)  
All right, what'd you forget this time?

**\- Using talk option (Majula menu)**  
Ohhh, I should've listened to the warnings. This place is flippin' mental.  
Huh? No, I wasn't born here. I'm from a wee bit… I'm from a wee bit out west, that's all.  
I've seen some rough times. I think I'll settle down for a while.

**\- Using talk option (Majula menu)**  
You wouldn't believe the shenanigans that happen in my business.  
I thought at least here in the middle of nowhere I could stay clear of, you know, my auld pals.  
Oh, don't ask me what happened! Have you no discretion, me auld chum?

**\- Using talk option (Majula menu)**  
That gaping hole? Hell, search me.  
It's where the people round here toss all their rubbish.  
Corpses or you know what… Whatever they'd rather be rid of.  
Oh, and, and those human statues. Who are they supposed to be?  
Anybody, I suppose. Probably just some auld pagan custom.  
What's it like at the bottom of the hole? Why in the hell would I know! Hah!

**\- Using talk option (Majula menu)**  
Oh, yes, somebody told me that the grave of a… of a saint lies below here.  
Not built by the King, no no. It dates back to a time long before him.  
The tomb connects to that hole.  
And there's…there's…there's something about some…some Rat King down there.  
Hell, if the old rat is as rich as they say, maybe I should go and pay him a visit!

**\- Using talk option (After long ladder purchase)**  
Here you are my friend, you can have these, eh! It's a little bonus, you know, for your big purchase.  
Ah come on, don't look so glum! I'm trying to be nice here!  
You're hopeless, I tell you…

**\- Requesting Majula ladder service**  
You want to go down that awful hole? You must have lost your marbles! Heh heh!  
Fine, sure, fine, I'm happy to be of service.  
You need a ladder, then, sure enough.  
But you'll…you'll have to show some generosity.

**\- Accepting 500 souls ladder**  
You just don't get it, do you.  
Fine, then, now it's my turn.

**\- Accepting 3500 souls ladder**  
A very reasonable offer!  
Just you wait! Hm-hm!

**\- Accepting 12000 souls ladder**  
Well! Really! A very generous offer indeed, especially from you!  
I get such a warm feeling inside when I get the chance to help others!

**\- Declining service**  
Well! Fine, it's not my business, anyway.

**\- After purchasing Majula ladder**  
Hey, this ladder's not for sale!  
Th…the only things I sell are miniatures. I mean, if that tickles yer fancy, you can buy as many as you like!

**\- Re-requesting ladder service**  
What, you're heading down after all?  
Well, that's fine, but if you want my help, you'll need to make me an offer.

**\- Leaving after accepting service (Majula)**  
Cheers for that! Hah hah!

**\- Leaving without accepting service (Majula)**  
What? Don't waste my time.

**\- Leaving without closing menu (Majula)**  
Oi! Where're you off to now!

**\- When attacking**  
Hey! That hurts!  
Hey! That hurts!  
You ungrateful little git! (_aggroed_)  
You vicious little! I'll not go down that easy! (_at 50% HP_)

**\- When he kills the player**  
It's your own damn fault.

**\- Re-encounter after dying to him**  
Why, you…I'll tear you limb from limb!
