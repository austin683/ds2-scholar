### Great Magic Weapon Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Buffs weapon with magic damage. Duration scales with Intelligence: 65 sec. at 18 Int, and up to 108 sec. at 27 Int. Superior to [Magic Weapon](/Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Magic Weapon"), but inferior to [Crystal Magic Weapon](/Crystal+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Magic Weapon"). Equivalent to [Flame Weapon](/Flame+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Flame Weapon") in effectiveness.  

    * The duration is directly related to intelligence. If you use Simpleton's Spice to reduce the cost to 10, the spell will only last roughly 20 seconds.
    * The duration also ends immediately if you switch the enchanted weapon out.
  * Rather unsurprisingly, this cannot be used to buff any magical catalysts like a staff (if you wielded two staffs and enchanted with the offhand one), so a Sorcerer cannot self-buff their spells with it. The exception to this is catalyst-weapons, like the Blue Flame
  * DS2's buff formula differs from other Souls games, instead relying primarily on the targeted weapon's base damage to determine how much AR the spell buff will add. Matching the spell buff with a damage type present on a weapon will add a flat bonus to the total AR, depending on whatever the weapon is infused with and/or naturally inflicts said damage type. A small scaling bonus is also added unless the targeted weapon doesn't scale at all with any stats.
