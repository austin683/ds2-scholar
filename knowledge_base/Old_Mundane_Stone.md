**Old Mundane Stone** is a type of [Upgrade Material](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Old Mundane Stone** , a modified titanite variant. Utilize it to infuse weapons with the power of the mundane. Not applicable to shields. Exclusively applicable at Blacksmith [Steady Hand McDuff's](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff") forge. This process diminishes the weapon's regular scaling but introduces mundane scaling. [Upgrade Materials](/Upgrades "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades") are items that are used to strengthen the statistical value and to increase the effect of a certain piece of equipment.

### DKS2 Old Mundane Stone Usage

  * Can only be used at Blacksmith [Steady Hand McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff")
  * Used to imbue weapons with the power of the mundane. This reduces the normal scaling a weapon has but adds a mundane scaling. Mundane-infused weapons lose half of their base damage and scale in damage based off of your **lowest** [Attribute](/Stats "Dark Souls 2 Stats"). It gets a starting buff of +50 with lowest attribute = 1 (can't be 0), it gets a bonus of 12 (62) with lowest attribute = 2, then for every level in your lowest attribute, the weapon will get +6 bonus up until level 20, then the bonus becomes +3 up to level 30, after which the bonus becomes +1 until level 40. Above 40, the pattern for every 2 levels becomes +1 and +2 until 50 (225). Above 50, only even levels (52, 54, 56, 58 and so on) will add 1 point to the bonus (tested, it's not 0.5 for every level, it's literally 1 point every 2 levels) until 98 (bonus 249). The last level adds 1 point bringing the bonus to 250.

  
To get the most out of this infusion, it should only be used for characters with very versatile builds, that put points into every attribute, or on characters with extremely high Soul Levels, that have no low stats left. It's best to use this stone on weapons that have minimal scaling. [Crossbows](/Crossbows "Dark Souls 2 Crossbows") and [Daggers](/Daggers "Dark Souls 2 Daggers") are good examples of this.   
  
Calculation of whether mundane infusion is an increase or decrease of damage would be:   
  
_([Base Damage/2 + Current Mundane Scaling] - [Base Damage + Current Scaling])_ = Damage gain/loss   
  
**Notes:**

  * Mundane weapons still receive scaling even when the weapon durability goes zero, this makes it extremely practical for weapons with either low durability or low base damage, especially [Darkdrift](/Darkdrift "Dark Souls 2 Darkdrift").
  * If two or lowest stats are equal, there would be no increase in scaling over only having one lowest stat.
  * Unlike all other infusions, the [Ring of Blades](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades") will give full 100% bonus damage to mundane weapons (rather than 50% for other infusion paths).
  * The Heavy Crossbow is an exception to this (Along with other crossbows, possibly). With 220 AR, it goes down to 33 if infused with mundane. Unsure if this is a bug or not.
