**Azal's Staff** is a **[Staff](/Staves "Dark Souls 2 Staves")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Azal's Staff **is a powerful catalyst that has S scaling for both [Sorceries](/Sorceries "Dark Souls 2 Sorceries") and [Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes"). However, it has a slow casting speed, low durability, and uses more stamina per spell than other staves.

> Staff of Azal, sage of Forossa.   
>   
>  Rather roughly crafted, but imbued with the magic of Azal. Greatly intensifies spells, but also drastically reduces spell usage.   
>   
>  This staff, unfit for the inexperienced, is evidence of sage Azal's prowess.

Past 3 [Rampart Golem](/Rampart+Golem "Dark Souls 2 Rampart Golem") enemies, near a gap in the bridge of the [Loyce Knight](/Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Knight") area.

### DS2 Azal's Staff Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5. CAN NOT be infused
  * S scaling for both Sorcery and Hexes, it outclasses [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff") and [Staff of Wisdom](/Staff+of+Wisdom "Dark Souls 2 Staff of Wisdom") when wielder has 65 Int + Faith
  * Extremely slow casting speed. highly recommended to equip [Clear Bluestone Ring +2](/Clear+Bluestone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Clear Bluestone Ring")
  * Extremely fragile, only 4 durability, highly recommended to equip [Bracing Knuckle Ring +2](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring").
  * Alternatively, use [Repair](/Repair "Dark Souls 2 Repair") Spell or [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder") regularly.
  * Increases the damage for spells / hexes cast by 20% but also reduces maximum spell uses to 1/4. This also applies to the spells / hexes cast by catalyst weld on the other hand.
  * Only sorceries and hexes that specify staff as the catalyst would be boosted.
  * Despite the slow casting speed, it has slightly better tracking once cast, the delay can often catch people offguard.
  * [Dark Orb](/Dark+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Dark Orb"), [Dark Hail](/Dark+Hail "Dark Souls 2 Dark Hail") and [Affinity](/Affinity "Dark Souls 2 Affinity") cast from this staff can be quite devastating if the delay tracking is executed well.
  * 578 magic and 597 dark at 50int/30faith.
  * Uses almost twice as much stamina per spell compared to other staves.
  * Recommend being used as the offhand buff weapon. Can also be utilized by low level characters without enough stats for this stave but already satisfied the stats requirement of other catalysts.
