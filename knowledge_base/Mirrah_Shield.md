**Mirrah Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Shield issued to the proud knights of Mirrah's official order._

     _In Mirrah, a land perennially beset by unrest, this shield was a symbol of the greatest knights'  
strength and willingness to give their lives for their country."_
