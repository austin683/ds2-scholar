**Maughlin the Armourer** is an [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") in **Dark Souls 2. Maughlin the Armourer** can be found in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). He is a jovial and enthusiastic individual who runs an armor shop near the town's entrance. **Maughlin** offers a variety of armor sets for sale, allowing the player to customize their character's appearance and defenses. Despite his friendly demeanor, Maughlin is also a somewhat tragic character, as his obsession with obtaining rare and valuable armor sets eventually leads to his downfall. 

### Maughlin the Armourer Information

  * Sells new armor sets after spending souls (1,000 and 15,000)(15,000 total not 16,000). After that, his stock increases with an additional armor set - purchasing any item at this point, advances his quest of getting rich. Then, related to purchase tasks, his inventory increases for the final time with another armor set - purchase any item once more. At this point, he has increased his inventory for the fourth time based on purchases, and will be so happy for finally being rich! Once he is rich, talking to him while holding **0 souls,** will give you the true version of the [ Aurous Set](/Aurous+Set "Dark Souls 2 Aurous Set") for free. After each step, a refresh is required for updating the process of his quest.
  * Drops the [Tseldora Robe](/Tseldora+Set "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Set"), [Tseldora Cap](/Tseldora+Set "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Set"), [Tseldora Trousers](/Tseldora+Set "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Set") and [Tseldora Manchettes](/Tseldora+Set "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Set") when killed. Note that killing him prevents getting Gathering Of Exiles Trophy/Achievement.
  * If killed will not give special armors or boss armors. May have been patched out. On the PC V1.02, if Maughlin is killed, he will still sell boss armors once the boss is killed, and you have made the minimum purchase necessary to unlock new sets. May require that you make a minimum purchase prior to killing him.
  * SotFS- Confirmed, if you spend 16000 souls BEFORE you kill him he will still sell boss armor AND you can still buy the butterfly set after using the appropriate bonfire aesthetics.

### Maughlin the Armourer Dialogue

**\- First Encounter**  
Err, oh, hello there!  
W-welcome, to my shop. I-I'm Maughlin, and I sell armour.  
Oh, sorry, I… Please, do have a look at my wares.  
I could really use the business… If you'd be so kind…

**\- Meeting Again**  
Oh, hello again. I-I hope you find something of use.

**\- Meeting Again**  
Well, thank you, for coming back! Do take a look at my wares.

**\- Meeting Again, after spending 1,000 souls**  
Oh, I was hoping that you would come.  
I've stocked some new things, and I thought you might be interested.  
They've been selling rather well, and I may step up operations soon.  
I'm…well I'm surprising even myself, to be honest.

**\- Meeting Again, after spending 1,000 souls**  
I'm glad to see you safe. Take…take a look at my wares.

**\- Meeting Again, after spending 1,000 souls**  
Forget to buy something? Go ahead, take your time.

**\- Meeting Again, after spending 15,000 souls**  
Um, sorry, have we met? Oh sorry, it's just I've been awfully busy lately.  
Care to look over my wares? Please, be my guest.  
I upgraded my stock recently. Although it may be a bit out of your reach…

**\- Meeting Again, after spending 15,000 souls**  
Looking for armour? Everything I offer is quite dependable.

**\- Meeting Again, after spending 15,000 souls**  
You need armour? Go ahead, see what I'm offering.

**\- When gifting the transparent Auros Set**  
In a spot of bother are we?  
Here, take this. My compliments.

**\- Using Talk Option**  
I came from the west, from Volgen.  
Have you been there? It's a lively place, vibrant with trade.  
Very competitive, of course. And y-you have to grease the wheels to get anywhere.  
But I didn't have the funding for that, so I left home in hopes of striking gold.  
It's been years since then, and I've… well I've made very little headway…hah hah  
I don't even know why I'm still here…  
Everything's all run-down and dying… It's t-terrible for business, really…

**\- Using Talk Option**  
A group calling themselves the Blue Sentinels have gained much power in Volgen.  
You can't even run a shop without their blessing.  
They claim to be working for the greater good, oh…but it's absolute hogwash.

**\- Using Talk Option**  
Hmm…  
Oh, by the gods…Why the hell am I here?

**\- Using Talk Option, after spending 1,000 souls**  
Did I mention before that I'm not from these parts?  
I was on a journey… And somehow ended up here…  
The desolation here was disenchanting at first. But over time, things started to turn my way.  
Yeah, I-I've got a good few regulars now.  
They're all strangely desperate, and quite willing to pay a premium.  
Sadly, some of them never come back. But I try not to think about it.

**\- Using Talk Option, after spending 1,000 souls**  
Have you seen that warrior lugging that giant blue sword about?  
I'm no expert, but that appears to be a fine specimen.  
The monstrous thing has a peculiar design, quite unlike anything found in Volgen.  
If you should speak to him, would you ask him if he won't sell it?  
I'd have to take another look, but I'm confident I could offer quite a price.

**\- Using Talk Option, after spending 1,000 souls**  
I considered returning to my homeland, but I've decided to stay a while longer.  
I've started to turn a handsome profit now, and I can't bear to give it up. Heh.

**\- Using Talk Option, after spending 15,000 souls**  
I'm rich, I'm rich…Mwa hah hah!  
I don't need to go home anymore!  
Home…home…? Where…where is home…?

**\- Using Talk Option, with Bluemoon Greatsword in inventory**  
That sword that you've got… May I, um, have a look at it?  
Hmm, it's…yeah…it's interesting, it's…  
Oh, no, I'm afrai…sorry, I'm afraid this is a fake. It's not worth much at all.  
The original must be somewhere, I would imagine.

**\- When leaving, having used his services**  
Thanks very much. And, do please come again.

**\- Using his services, after spending 1,000 souls**  
Thanks very much. Do come again!

**\- Using his services, after spending 15,000 souls**  
Thanks for the purchase. Do come again.

**\- When leaving, without having used his services**  
Well, I, I do hope I see you again.

**\- Not using his services, after spending 1,000 souls**  
Always open for business.

**\- Not using his services, after spending 15,000 souls**  
Are you sure? Well…I may sell out while you're away.

**\- When walking off without closing the menu**  
Oh, is something wrong?

**\- Walking off, after spending 1,000 souls**  
Finished already?

**\- Walking off, after spending 15,000 souls**  
Now, have some patience!

**\- When attacked**  
Who…what the?! (_not aggroed_)  
C-curses upon you! Enough of this! (_aggroed_)

**\- When killing the player**  
I-I did it…

**\- Re-encounter after dying to Maughlin**  
Oh it's y-you again?

**\- When HP is reduced to 50%**  
Y-you won't get me!
