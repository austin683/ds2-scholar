  * Rouge Water, etc.: Fixed issue causing the user not to recover spell usages for spells only able to be used once.

  * Corrected issue whereby users could not use [Bonfire Ascetics](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") Entrance Bonfire.
  * Adjusted timing for [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt") to become the player’s enemy.
  * Adjusted conditions for lighting [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") map from “Defeat [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra")” to “Defeat [Throne Defender and ](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher and Throne Defender")[Throne Watcher](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher and Throne Defender").”
  * To prevent invasion after defeating area bosses, made the [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") effect function in this situation automatically.
  * Made it possible to get the reward items after defeating area bosses even if your inventory is full at the time. (Items will drop in front of the player.)
