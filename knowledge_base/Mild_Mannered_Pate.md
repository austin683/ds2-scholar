### Mild Mannered Pate Dialogue

**\- When first met in Forest of Fallen Giants before going into the trap**

  1. Hello there. Travelling all alone in these treacherous times?  
Well, I hope you have a very good reason.  
Oh, hogwash, who am I to judge? Hah…  
My name is Pate.  
I journey hither and thither…On a sort of… …treasure hunt, you might call it.  
Be careful out there. There's talk of unsavoury bandits who prey upon travelers like yourself.
  2. Oh yes, you be cautious if you go any farther.  
There's treasure in there, for certain, but the entrance locks from behind.  
I saw the same design earlier, and it's the same contraption, I'm sure.  
I was with this warrior, you see, and he insisted that he go inside first.  
The rather brusque fellow tried to swipe the loot for himself, but it trapped him inside.  
I still have the gent's ring. I do hope he wasn't harmed.
  3. I'll leave this one to you. I'm worried about what might be inside.

**\- When talking after going through the trap in Forest of Fallent Giants**

  1. Well, I see you managed to escape.  
I hope that brave warrior didn't come a cropper either.  
Be careful out there. There's talk of unsavoury bandits who prey upon travelers like yourself.
  2. Oh, but you should take this.  
It allows Undead to call out for help to one another, across the fissures between worlds.  
With luck, somebody will lend you a hand.

**\- When talking after going through the trap in Forest of Fallent Giants, if you didn't talk to him first**

  1. I wanted to warn you of the trap down the way, but you walked right past me.  
My name is Pate.  
I journey hither and thither…On a sort of… …treasure hunt, you might call it.  
Be careful out there. There's talk of unsavoury bandits who prey upon travelers like yourself.
  2. Good to see you safe.

**\- When met in Earthen Peak**  
Well, we meet again.  
There's treasure this way… But I've a bad feeling about it.  
I don't quite have the guts myself! Hah hah…

**\- When talking after getting the treasure in Earthen Peak**

  1. Well, good to see that you survived.  
Perhaps you're more rugged than I thought.  
In any case, the treasure is yours. Since you went ahead, and took the leap.
  2. I prefer a more cautious approach. It's hard to know who to even trust these days.  
For instance, I've heard that a man is out for my life.  
Now, what misunderstanding could have ever led to that?  
The poor bloke must have quite an imagination. Heh…
  3. You be careful, too, my friend. For trust can be a dangerous thing.

**\- When encountered fighting Creighton in Brighstone Cove Tseldora**  
He swung at me! Please, lend me a hand!

**\- When talking after helping him kill Creighton**

  1. What misunderstanding could have caused this?  
Well. Thank you. I owe you my life.  
My little pied-à-terre lies beyond here.  
You'll find some of my treasures there. Help yourself to those that suit you.  
Here, use this key.
  2. Be cautious on your travels.

**\- When talking after he kills Creighton without player help**  
What was he thinking?  
I haven't done a thing.

**\- When the player opens the trapped chest in Brightstone Cove Tseldora**  
Ooh, that'll leave a nice scar!

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
We went through a lot together. Take these, as a token of our friendship.  
Don't be shy, they were meant for you…Heh heh…

**\- When attacked but not aggroed**  
Eek!  
(or)  
What the devil's…!  
(or)  
Now, stop that!

**\- When attacked and aggroed**  
Oh, I can scrimmage, my friend.

**\- When killing the player**  
Heh heh heh…

**\- When re-encountered after aggroing**  
You again? Oh, heavens…

**\- When attacked and health is under 50%**  
Not too shabby…Heh heh…

**\- When killed**  
(death scream; no subtitles)
