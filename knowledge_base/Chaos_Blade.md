**Chaos Blade** is a **[Katana](/Katanas "Dark Souls 2 Katanas")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. **Chaos Blade** stands out with a unique feature, dealing 50 HP self-damage per successful hit. This drawback can be offset with items like the [Ring of the Evil Eye](/Ring+of+the+Evil+Eye "Dark Souls 2 Ring of the Evil Eye") or [Ring of Restoration](/Ring+of+Restoration "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Restoration"). The 2-handed strong attack provides precise control, enabling strategic moves and follow-up hits. The 1-handed strong attack has good reach and benefits from the [Old Leo Ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring") for extra thrust damage.

> A Katana of unknown origin. Damage to foes also damages its owner.
> 
> The peculiar pattern upon the blade suggests the sinister nature of this cursed blade.
> 
> It is an alluring vortex and a lonely soul.

### How to get Chaos Blade in Dark Souls 2

  * [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex"), traded for [Old Witch Soul](/Old+Witch+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Old Witch Soul") and 10,000 souls.
  * Can only be acquired in NG+ and beyond or by using [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at the Sinner's Rise bonfire in a normal game.

### DS2 Chaos Blade Hints & Tips

  * Reinforced with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5.
  * Successful hits also damage the wielder (50 HP). Self damage will still be applied when attacking destructible objects, but not when attacking indestructible objects. You can be killed by the self damage.
  * The self damage can be offset by using the [Ring of the Evil Eye](/Ring+of+the+Evil+Eye "Dark Souls 2 Ring of the Evil Eye") or [Ring of Restoration ](/Ring+of+Restoration "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Restoration")as well as [Resplendent Life](/Resplendent+Life "Dark Souls 2 Resplendent Life") and [Replenishment](/Replenishment "Dark Souls 2 Replenishment").
  * The 2-handed strong attack has excellent direction control and can be used to bait opponents into approaching into range. A successful hit can almost always be followed by a second strong attack to deal a substantial amount of damage.
  * The 1-handed strong attack in turn has excellent forward range but is hard to track without using lock on. However, because it's a thrust attack, it benefits from the boost of the [Old Leo Ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring"). When stacked with [Ring of Blades](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades") and hitting an enemy on counter damage animation, the player can **double** the damage they would deal normally.
  * As of Regulation 1.08, Chaos Blade now receives S Dexterity scaling. At Normal + 5 and 50 DEX, the weapon has an attack rating of 374. With the Ring of Blades +2, the attack rating is 424. Self damage 30 -> 50.
  * The blade's length is longer than the [Blacksteel Katana](/Blacksteel+Katana "Dark Souls 2 Blacksteel Katana") and shorter than the [Washing Pole](/Washing+Pole "Dark Souls 2 Washing Pole"); also handy for dual wielding.
  * Has slightly (10) more counter damage, more durability and less weight than the [Blacksteel Katana](/Blacksteel+Katana "Dark Souls 2 Blacksteel Katana"), making it a good alternative if the HP loss is not a concern for the player.
