Twinblades are best used two-handed, where they are capable of dealing a fast flurries of attacks that can possibly stunlock an opponent when landed. Twinblades cannot perform a parry when used with two hands, but possible when wielded with one hand. Wielding a Twinblade with one handed will slow down its attack speed and weaken its damage output. Twinblades can wear out easily when used heavily on armored opponents, as well as enemies who possess high health. This page covers a list of all Twinblades in Dark Souls 2.
