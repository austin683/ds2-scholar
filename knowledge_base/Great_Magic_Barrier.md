> "Superior miracle to Magic Barrier.  
> Increases resistance to magic, lightning, fire, and dark.  
>   
> The knights of Mirrah are expected to fight honorably, with reliance only upon swordsmanship.  
> They only resort to magic the only time they truly need it: to face the magic of an enemy."

### Acquired From

  * Purchase it from [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") for 9 300 souls
  * Treasure chest in Aldia's Keep - on a side path of the floor with mirrors
  * Body in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"), underneath the staircase after the Ruin Sentinels' area near [King's Gate](/King%27s+Gate "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Gate") Bonfire (NG+)

### Notes

  * 250 resistance to magic, lighting, fire, and dark. Is not AoE like the weaker version Magic Barrier. Lasts 90 seconds.
  * After the 1.06 calibration patch, the duration of Great Magic Barrier is dependent upon the user's faith. At 10 FTH, even if lowered with Skeptic's Spice, the spell will last only 10 seconds. At 20 FTH it lasts about 30 seconds. At 30 FTH 60 seconds, at 50 FTH 90 seconds.
