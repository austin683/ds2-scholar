### Dark Souls 2 Leydia Witch Information

_Witches who worship the god of disease, Galib. They once resided in the Undead Crypt alongside the Fenito but over time grew conceited, misusing their power and usurping control of the Crypt's gateway. Their actions spurned the Grave Wardens and they were slaughtered as transgressors; their spirits now forcibly serve as guardians of the Crypt._   
  
Fenito witches, also a member of Leydia Apostiles along with [Leydia Pyromancer](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") (referred by Leydia Gloves). Due to their magical power and loyality, they're served as security guards of the crypt, they will attack with a huge range of spells and are very dangerous from a distance.

### Leydia Witch Strategy Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Far Range: You can stay behind pillars and walls, pop out every now and then to shoot them with arrows or magic.or just shoot and tank the damage (their Affinity is really weak - only a threat if multiple witches alternate casting and stunlock you with it)
  * Close range: Pop up every now and then and bash them until you're almost out of stamina. (Be careful and watch out for possible spells that they cast, especially Firestorm and Dark Fog)
