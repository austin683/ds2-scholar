  * Black Witch Veil is a droppable item from [Bell Keeper Mage](/Bell+Keeper+Mage "Dark Souls 2 Bell Keeper Mage") at the very beginning of Belfry Sol, who will only spawn once per ascetic/playthrough(very rare drop) and also from Invader Gutter Denizen drop - guaranteed.

### Notes

  * Part of [Black Witch Set](/Black+Witch+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch Set").
  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades#Ore").
  * Hat gives +1 attunement slot, but requires 20 [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") to wear (* Intelligence only needed for defensive stats, attunement slot is obtained even without 20 intelligence).
  * Black Witch Domino Mask seems to increase spell damage by roughly 3% (Soul Level 227 with 50 INT and Olenford's: 587 without mask and 605 with it, against same enemies). 
    * Mask raises magic ATK but lower max HP. Requires 20 intelligence to wear. 
      * Decreases HP by roughly 15% (Soul Level 227 with 32 VGR and no other equipment had 1714 HP before equip and 1456 HP after).
  * Retains the +1 attunement slot even while broken.
