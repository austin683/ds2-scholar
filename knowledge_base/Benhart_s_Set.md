**Benhart's Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Helmet/Armor/Gauntlets/Boots of unknown origin. Belonged to Benhart of Jugo.  
>   
> Apparently Benhart found this while wandering land to land, but its origins are unknown. He wore it all the time, he adored it so, leaving a slight odor.

###  Set Location

  * Complete Benhart's achievement, "Moonlight Greatsword" by successfully defeating three bosses with him, then speak to him next to Giant Tree that gives access to [Memory of Orro](/Memory+of+Orro "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Orro").
  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") (24,7k) upon Benhart's death.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * The family crest is same as [Creighton's Set](/Creighton%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Creighton%27s Set"), while Creighton's Set is a replica of Mirrah's armor and the replica's description stated the origin of the crest, Benhart found this while traveling outdoor, this is believed to be the true Mirrah's armor.
  * Benhart spoke out his homeland was in the far east, probably referred to Mirrah, perhaps he's actually a Knight of Mirrah, or a person struggling to find his origin, or, he's a part of the memory.
