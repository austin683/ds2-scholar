### How to get Puzzling Stone Sword in Dark Souls 2

  * In [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon's+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon's Sanctum"), in the long, narrow pathway with the little staircase (with the hole). Jump over the hole in the staircase and search for a quadratic hole in the wall; shoot at the plate you see at the the end of it using a bow to open a door, but don't go in yet. Afterwards, follow the hallway; at the end of the hallway, search the high wall for another plate and shoot it. Now go back to the previous door and enter. There will be an enemy to left, two downstairs to the right, and a floor switch that activates a trap. After you've killed them, you should see three chests: two wooden and one metal one, the metal one holds the sword.
  * You can receive one as a rare drop by helping another player with [Graverobber, Varg and Cerah](/Graverobber%2C+Varg%2C+and+Cerah "Dark Souls 2 Graverobber%2C Varg%2C and Cerah").
  * You can receive another one as loot on the big Worm before the Graverobber, Varg, and Cerah boss.
