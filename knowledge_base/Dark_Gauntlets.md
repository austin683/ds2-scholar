### Dark Gauntlets Description

_"Gauntlets of a knight subsumed by dark._  
_No one knows the true identity of these men who are said to freely manipulate dark. Old foreign legends describe them as poor souls who chased the lost art of life drain."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * The Gauntlets can be obtained in a [mimic](/mimic) chest in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak). Right before the boss fight with Mytha, there is a small staircase leading up. To the left, there is an NPC invader. To the right there is a room blocked by poison pots. Break the pots and proceed. The room is filled with enemies that produce poison gas, so have some moss ready. The mimic chest will be in the room.
