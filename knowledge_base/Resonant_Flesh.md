**Resonant Flesh** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> "A hex developed independently by Outcast Felkin.   
> Transforms a certain number of souls into HP over a period of time.  
>   
> Something gained, something lost.  
>   
> Catalyst: sacred chime"

### Acquired From

  * [Felkin the Outcast ](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast")for 3400 souls

### Resonant Flesh Notes

  * Resonant Flesh will temporarily increase your max HP at the cost of your souls. If you have little to no Souls on you when you cast this spell, you'll barely notice your health bar increase at all, and that tiny increase will only last for 30 seconds. If you have 2000 souls, the increase in health will be around 20% and it will last for 3 minutes. Doesn't stack on itself, but does stack with other items that increase max HP.
  * Note that what will increase will be your maximum HP, but your current HP will remain the same. Therefore you will have to heal yourself after using this spell.
