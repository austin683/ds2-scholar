### DS2 Manikin Knife Hints and Tips

  * Manikin Weapons (Knife, Scimitar & Claws) have a strange relation to Infusion. While most weapons get their physical damage almost cut in half when infused with an effect; the manikin weapons hardly lose any physical damage upon infusion. However to counter this advantage, the effect the weapons are infused with isn't as potent compared to other weapons.
