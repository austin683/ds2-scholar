**Repair Powder** is a type of [Consumable](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Repair Powder** , enchanted metal transformed into powder, mends equipment. With usage, weapons and armor wear down, risking usability if wear is allowed to accumulate. [Consumable Items](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") grant various effects such as restorative properties for recovering HP, removing certain negative status effects, applying temporary buffs and debuffs, as well as activating various actions and effects.

> Enchanted metal rendered into powder. Repairs equipment. Weapons and armor wear down with use. Allow too much wear, and you won't be able to use them.  
> You have only yourself to blame if you find yourself in crisis with no powder to spare.
