**Lucatiel's Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
_"Mask attached to a ceremonial hat. Belonged to Lucatiel of Mirrah._   
_Normally hats and masks are separate, but these two have been adjoined."_   
  
_"Vest/Gloves/Trousers worn by knights while on travel. Belonged to Lucatiel of Mirrah._   
_Only those who have distinguished themselves on the battlefield were admitted into the elite ranks of Mirrah's official order of knights._   
_It is common to hear of a peasant's dream of striving for knighthood as an escape from hardship, but who would ever think it possible?_

###  Set Location

  * Given by [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah) in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia's+Keep "Aldia's Keep") if she had been summoned and survived 3 boss encounters.
  * Mask drops from Lucatiel if she is killed, other pieces are sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia) (18k).
  * A [maskless version](/Mirrah+Hat) of her hat can be obtained in [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King) DLC.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Titanite").
  * Vest offers second highest lightning defense (almost equal to that of [Archdrake](/Archdrake+Set), [Priestess](/Priestess+Set) and [Saint's](/Saint's+Set) robes).
  * Boots offer second highest lightning defense (almost equal to that of [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress+Set), [Priestess](/Priestess+Set) and [White Priest](/White+Priest+Set) skirts).
