### Undead Crypt Walkthrough

### Just a regular Bonfire

From the elevator from [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana"), proceed forward into a room with a staircase, and the 'Undead Crypt Entrance' bonfire is right ahead. Trying to ignite it the first time will cause an explosion and [Aldia, the Scholar of the First Sin](/Aldia,+scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Aldia, scholar of the First Sin") to erupt from the ground. Exhaust his dialogue for some saucy lore and to send him back down, this makes the bonfire available to light, only for realsies this time. On the right of the stairs is a corpse with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). On the left of the stairs, in a small area inside the stairs, there is also an [Invisible Hollow](/Invisible+Hollows "Dark Souls 2 Invisible Hollows").

### Voice of Reason

Head up the stairs (later, one of the [Insolent Spirits](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits") can be found here) to enter a room with two [Syan Soldiers](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier"). After taking care of them, you can enter a room with a non-hostile [Torch Hollow](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") that will simply follow you, and an [Imperious Knight](/Undead+Crypt+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt Knight") that blocks the entrance to the next door. Inside this room are a few [Hollows](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") and 2 [Leydia Witches](/Leydia+Witch "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Witch") (later, there will be 2 [Insolent Spirits](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits") here), who can cast hexes and miracles. You can also summon [Devotee Scarlett](/Devotee+Scarlett "Dark Souls 2 Devotee Scarlett") on the right, immediately after descending the initial steps.

Going through the doorway, there will be another [Invisible Hollow](/Invisible+Hollows "Dark Souls 2 Invisible Hollows") on the left of the short steps. Take his loot, then go up the short steps and through a thin corridor. Upon exiting the corridor, you are told to halt and not produce light by [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne"), who stands on top above a walkway. Get to him by taking the stairs on the right, past his Guards that line the approach to him but do not attack until provoked -you can attack them without aggroing [Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne"), after you've talked to him. Any form of torch lighting here makes him hostile, including letting the [Torch Hollow](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") from the first room follow you. There is a corpse near him with a [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). Exhausting [Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne")'s dialogue gives you a good chunk of lore, allows you to learn the gesture 'Have Mercy!', and also becomes a merchant who sells some useful wares. On the wall on the left (when facing him) is another [Invisible Hollow](/Invisible+Hollows "Dark Souls 2 Invisible Hollows").

### Soul Vessel Collection

Head back down the staircase and through the doorway on your right. Before proceeding up stairs to the right, you'll want to drop off the left. This brings you down to a small area in which two [Hollows](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") will attack you. You can also loot a [Simpleton’s Spice](/Simpleton's+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton's Spice") and a [Soul of a Great Hero](/Soul+of+a+Great+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Great Hero"). Continue to the end of this short hallway to find a ladder leading up to where you'll encounter another [Hollow](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") and an iron chest with a [Crushed Eye Orb](/Crushed+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Crushed Eye Orb") and a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed"); a [Ghost](/Roaming+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Roaming Soul") will attack when you're midway up the ladder. Drop down to land on the walkway at the top of the stairs you ignored earlier with a sconce, then a mist. If you light the sconce, an invader will spawn a few meters from you. 

When you arrive at the mist door, don't go in yet (we will later arrive at the are behind it anyway) and instead, drop down to the left. Going down the small steps will let us reach a small statue of a woman. If you light it with your torch, it will illuminate the area greatly BUT it will also spawn 11 non-respawning [Insolent Spirits](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits") in the level so think twice. The first of them will already spawn behind you right, the second one can be found up on the ledge you jumped down to get here. After either taking care of them or deciding to not light the torch at all, go back up the stairs to where you landed, and go through the doorframe, which leads to a room with an [Imperious Knight](/Undead+Crypt+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt Knight") guarding a [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel"). From there, simply go up a ladder to a skeleton containing a [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero"). Following the path and going down the ladder, you enter a room with the **Undead Ditch****Bonfire**.

### Rocky Situation

You can not go up the ladder again, so instead, we are going to enter a room full of stones and statues; the stones can be destroyed by attacking them, the statues with swords will make [Leydia Pyromancer](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") appear if you get too close, and the statues with bells will cause every Pyromancer-Statue that are close to make their Pyromancer appear. In here, you will have to fight several [Hollows](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") emerging from the earth, as well as 3 [Leydia Pyromancer](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer"). The Hollows will keep on re-emerging from the ground as long as you are close to skeletons containing items, each Hollow beeing triggered by a different Skeleton. Each of the Pyromancer will keep respawning quickly when you reach their statue (the ones holding a sword), till you destroyed their statue. There is also a [Skeleton](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") waiting in a corner near the far exit of this room. After dealing with him and the Pyromancer Statues, you will have time to take the loot scattered around.

The corpse at the corner near the entrence from the bonfire contains a [Simpleton's Spice](/Simpleton's+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton's Spice") and 2x [Black Firebomb](/Black+Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Black Firebomb"), the one near the first Bell Statue contains 2x [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"), the one in the middle of the room [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero"). If you go right from that corpse, you arrive at the Fog Gate from before (if you decide to go through there, be carefull of the [Insolent Spirit](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits") that spawned in the the lower area that leaded to the chest with the [Crushed Eye Orb](/Crushed+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Crushed Eye Orb") and a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed").), as well as a harmless corpse containing a [Titanite Chunk](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk") and a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") left of the Gate, going left from the corpse, in the corner, lies another skeleton with [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth & Silky Stone"). This one will not cause a Hollow to appear, instead, a [Wall Spectre](/Wall+Spectre "Dark Souls 2 Wall Spectre") will attack you when you try to claim this item. The skeleton nearby does not trigger anything and contains another [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth & Silky Stone"). Going past the exit of this room, there is another non-triggering skeleton in the corner containing a [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth & Silky Stone") as well.

After taking all the loot, go up the ladder on the other side of the corpse that had the [Titanite Chunk](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk") and a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). Up there, you willl find another [Insolent Spirit](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits") as well as a [Leydia Witch](/Leydia+Witch "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Witch") guarding a chest containing [Dried Fingers](/dried+fingers "Dark Souls 2 dried fingers"), [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") and a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). After taking the treasure, go back down the stairs and head towards the exit of the room, to enter another room with stones and statues. Destroy statue that summons the[ Pyromancers](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer"), and once again, be wary of the re-emerging [Hollow](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner"), another [Skeleton](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton"), and [Wall Spectre](/Wall+Spectre "Dark Souls 2 Wall Spectre") on the left wall as well. In the room, you'll find a corpse with a [Soul of Lost Undead](/Large+Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Lost Undead"), and around the corner from it, you will find another Pyromancer-Statue as well as a [Bracing Knuckle Ring +2](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring").

The next room contains another [Insolent Spirit](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits"), entering it will also trigger the [Nameless Usurper](/Nameless+Usurper "Dark Souls 2 Nameless Usurper") invasion; be wary of the [Wall Spectres](/Wall+Spectre "Dark Souls 2 Wall Spectre") here as well. Upon clearing the room, loot the corpse with the [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing") and [Soul of Nameless Hero](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). There is an illusory wall to right with another [Wall Spectre](/Wall+Spectre "Dark Souls 2 Wall Spectre") and a iron chest containing [Avelyn](/Avelyn "Dark Souls 2 Avelyn") and 15x [Heavy Bolt](/Heavy+Bolt "Dark Souls 2 Heavy Bolt"). Go back and before heading to the next room, take care of the [Invisible Hollow](/Invisible+Hollows "Dark Souls 2 Invisible Hollows") on the left of the exit.

Continue down the candlelit hallway, with three more [Wall Spectre](/Wall+Spectre "Dark Souls 2 Wall Spectre"), to find a blockade created by two [Imperious Knights](/Undead+Crypt+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt Knight"). Defeat them then continue to the big hole in the floor behind them, but don't jump down yet. Go to the statue on the left of the skeleton first, to find another [Invisible Hollow](/Invisible+Hollows "Dark Souls 2 Invisible Hollows").

The next room is tricky. With the corridor you came from in your back:

  * 12 'o clock - An illusory wall, but before triggering it, let's make the room as safe as can be. There's various bells and statues in the room, and [Hollows](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") will do their best to ring the bells. Triggering this illusory wall gives access to a **Pharros contraption**. Activating this reveals an opening across the room - 
    * 6 'o clock - Hitting the Pharros-stained wall leads to a chest containing [Great Lightning Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear") and [Olendford's Staff](/Olenford's+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Olenford's Staff"), guarded by another [Insolent Spirit](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits").
  * 1 'o clock - A doorway, and before the doorway, a bell and a [Pyromancer](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer")-spawning-statue. Destroy the statue, but be careful not to hit the bell.
  * 7 'o clock - Another doorway, and before that one there's another statue, destroy it. There is also another statue down this doorway.
  * 11 'o clock - Another doorway, and, a little to the right of it, there's another statue that needs destroying. This doorway also contains a [Large soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight") and one [Dragon Charm](/Dragon+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Charm")
  * 4 'o clock - The last statue. The doorway also leads back to the halls you were in earlier, but further down. There will be another [Insolent Spirit](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits") here as well. Eventually you'll arrive at a lever, which will open a bridge back to the last bonfire. There's a chest further down, containing a [Magic Stone](/Magic+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Magic Stone") and a [Darknight Stone](/Darknight+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Darknight Stone"). Enter the room next to the chest.

After dealing with the statues, there are also 2 corpses that can be looted here, one (near the exit) containing a [Mace of the Insolent](/Mace+of+the+Insolent "Dark Souls 2 Mace of the Insolent") and a [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero"), the other one (around 5 'o clock) containing a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem") and a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone").

### Boss of the Aegis

Beneath stairs is a hallway with a [Hollow](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") and a bell. Kill it without ringing the bell, then camp it until you kill two more [Hollows](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") that will attempt to activate the bell; the second will come from the left side, and after, the third one spawning next to the bell. Now that spawning [Pyromancers](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") are not a threat, proceed to the corner opposite to the bell to kill the [Invisible Hollow](/Invisible+Hollows "Dark Souls 2 Invisible Hollows"). If the bell is rung, the [Pyromancers](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") -that spawn by the pillars ahead- can be picked off with a bow from afar. Behind the second statue on the right, the sixth on the left and the last on the right, there are another [Invisible Hollow](/Invisible+Hollows "Dark Souls 2 Invisible Hollows"). Behind the third statue on the left is the last [Insolent Spirit](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits").

Past them are 2 [Royal Knights](/Royal+Knights "Dark Souls 2 Royal Knights") and a non-respawning [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider"). There are two chests on each side of the fog gate:

  * On the right side: 
    * One chest contains [Poison Throwing Knife](/Poison+Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Poison Throwing Knife") x15 and the other chest contains a [Darknight Stone](/Darknight+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Darknight Stone").
  * On the left side: 
    * One chest contains [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch") x4 and the other has a [Fragrant Brach of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore").
    * You'll also find the [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne") summon sign here.

When ready, sttep through the mist to face the boss.

BOSS FIGHT: [Velstadt, The Royal Aegis](/Velstadt,+The+Royal+Aegis "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt, The Royal Aegis")

### See you later Vendrick

After the boss is defeated, the doorway straight ahead leads to [King Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick"). Don't worry, the first time you pass him, he's content with walking in circles and will not retaliate on any beating you give him, and will not take any damage either. Go down and around him to the item on the other side of the room. This is the [King's Ring](/King's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King's Ring"); now you can go in search of Giant souls to weaken [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick"), as you're not able to fight him now. Going back up the stairs after taking the ring, the [Emerald Herald](/Emerald+Herald "Dark Souls 2 Emerald Herald") will stand at the top of the stairs, explaining to you to use the ring to open the King's Gates in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") (Progress), [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") (aquire more [Soul of a Giant](/Soul+of+a+Giant "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Giant")) and [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") (leading towards the Final Boss).

### Soul Farming Tips

After you kill [Velstadt](/Velstadt,+The+Royal+Aegis "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt, The Royal Aegis"), come back to this room with a good number of long range spells or arrows. Arrows work better for this purpose it is easier to aim, Do not kill the zombie that rings the bell in the previous area. Now run everything. The only ones that might follow you into the boss room is the knights, but they do not respawn. You can stand in the boss room and pick off the respawning [Leydia Pyromancers](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") for 750 souls each.

You can kill them with good arrows in 2-4 shots, they also drop pretty good items -you may want to equip gear that helps with your item discovery. If they stop respawning you can burn a bonfire ascetic, and will be harder to defeat but will also come better with drops.

If you're having a lot of PVP or you are using small white sign soapstone to farm Smooth and Silkies or souls here, exercise caution in this room since invaders will use the bell to summon spectres and make an easy kill out of you while you're in the middle of the enemy horde/spell storm.

  * If you return to Agdayne after obtaining the [King's Ring](/King's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King's Ring"), 'Talk' to him and he will give you the [Darkdrift](/Darkdrift "Dark Souls 2 Darkdrift") katana and the [Agdayne's armor](/Agdayne's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Agdayne's Set") set.

If you choose to run past the two [Imperious Knights](/Undead+Crypt+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt Knight") that create blockade, they will not follow you down the circular hole in the next room

### Undead Crypt Walkthrough

### Just a regular Bonfire

From the elevator from [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana"), proceed forward into a room with a staircase, and the 'Undead Crypt Entrance Bonfire' right ahead. Trying to ignite it the first time will cause an explosion and [Aldia, the Scholar of the First Sin](/Aldia,+scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Aldia, scholar of the First Sin") erupt from the ground. Exhaust his dialogue for some saucy lore and to send him back down, this makes the bonfire available to light, only for realsies this time. On the right of the stairs is a corpse with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem").

### Voice of Reason

Head up the stairs to enter a room with two [Syan Soldiers](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier"). After taking care of them, you can enter a room with a non-hostile [Torch Hollow](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") that will simply follow you, and an [Imperious Knight](/Undead+Crypt+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt Knight") that blocks the entrance to the next door. Inside this room are a few [Hollows](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") and 2 [Leydia Witches](/Leydia+Witch "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Witch"), who can cast hexes and miracles.

[pic 1]

Going through the doorway and up the short steps then again through a thin corridor. Upon exiting the corridor, you are told to halt and not produce light by [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne"), who stands on top above a walkway. Get to him by taking the stairs on the right, past his Guards line the approach to him but do not attack until provoked -you can attack them without aggroing [Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne"), after you've talked to him. Any form of torch lighting here makes him hostile, including letting the [Torch Hollow](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") from the first room follow you. There is a corpse near him with a [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). Exhausting [Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne")'s dialogue gives you a good chunk of lore, allows you to learn the gesture 'Have Mercy!', and also becomes a merchant who sells some useful wares.

### Soul Vessel Collection

Head back down the staircase and through the doorway on your right. Before proceeding up stairs to the right, you'll want to drop off the left. This brings you down to a small area in which two [Hollows](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") will attack you.You can also loot a [Simpleton’s Spice](/Simpleton's+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton's Spice") and a [Soul of a Great Hero](/Soul+of+a+Great+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Great Hero"). Continue to the end of this short hallway to find a ladder leading up to where you'll encounter another [Hollow](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") and an iron chest with a [Crushed Eye Orb](/Crushed+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Crushed Eye Orb") and a [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed"); a [Ghost](/Roaming+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Roaming Soul") will attack when you're midway up the ladder. Drop down to land on the walkway at the top of the stairs you ignored earlier with a sconce, then a mist. If you light the sconce, an invader will spawn a few meters from you. 

When you arrive at the mist door, if you drop down to the left, it leads to an [Imperious Knight](/Undead+Crypt+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt Knight") guarding a [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel"). From down here, simply go up a ladder to enter the bonfire that is located just to the left, past the mist door. In this area, where you first drop down, before you reach the [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel"), there is a small statue of a woman that if you light with your torch will illuminate the area greatly BUT it will also spawn around 6 non-respawning [Insolent Spirits](/Insolent+Spirit "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirit") in the level so think twice. Approaching the statue on right spawns [Leydia Pyromancers](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer"), while several [Hollows](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") lurk about this room regardless. Destroying the statues stops the[ Pyromancers](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") from spawning. Nearby around the corner is a room with the Undead Ditch bonfire.

### Rocky Situation

A corpse with a [Titanite Chunk](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk") and [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") in corner behind, and a ladder nearby leads up to a walkway where a [Leydia Witch](/Leydia+Witch "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Witch") stands in front of a chest. The chest contains [Dried Fingers](/dried+fingers "Dark Souls 2 dried fingers"), a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") and a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). Head back down the ladder to the prior room. To the left, find a [Simpleton’s Spice](/Simpleton's+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton's Spice") and 2x [Black Firebomb](/Black+Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Black Firebomb") then proceed to the right to go into the room in Section 4.

Entering into the next room, destroy statue that summons the[ Pyromancers](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer"), and once again, be wary of the [Hollows](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") as well. In the room, you'll find a corpse with a [Soul of Lost Undead](/Large+Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Lost Undead"), and around the corner from it, you will find a [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring") +2. Continue into the next open room to trigger the [Nameless Usurper](/Nameless+Usurper "Dark Souls 2 Nameless Usurper") invasion; be wary of the [Ghosts](/Roaming+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Roaming Soul") here as well. Upon clearing the room, loot the corpse with the [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing") and [Soul of Nameless Hero](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). There is an illusory wall to right with 2 more of these wall-[Ghosts](/Roaming+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Roaming Soul"), including one who guards the iron chest in the room. Kill them and loot the chest for the [Avelyn](/Avelyn "Dark Souls 2 Avelyn") and 15x [Heavy Bolt](/Heavy+Bolt "Dark Souls 2 Heavy Bolt").

[pic 4]

Continue down the candlelit hallway, with three more wall-[Ghosts](/Roaming+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Roaming Soul"), to find a blockade created by two [Imperious Knights](/Undead+Crypt+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt Knight"). Defeat them then continue to the big hole in the floor behind them, and before jumping down, try hitting the statue left of the skeleton.

The next room is tricky. With the corridor you came from in your back:

  * 12 'o clock - An illusory wall, but before triggering it, let's make the room as safe as can be. There's various bells and statues in the room, and [Hollows](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") will do their best to ring the bells. Triggering this illusory wall gives access to a **Pharros contraption**. Activating this reveals an opening across the room - 
    * 6 'o clock - Hitting the Pharros-stained wall leads to a chest containing [Great Lightning Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear") and [Olendford's Staff](/Olenford's+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Olenford's Staff").
  * 1 'o clock - A doorway, and before the doorway, a bell and a [Pyromancer](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer")-spawning-statue. Destroy the statue, but be careful not to hit the bell.
  * 7 'o clock - Another doorway, and before that one there's another statue, destroy it. There is also another statue down this doorway.
  * 11 'o clock - Another doorway, and, a little to the right of it, there's another statue that needs destroying. This doorway also contains a [Large soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight") and one [Dragon Charm](/Dragon+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Charm")
  * 4 'o clock - The last statue. The doorway also leads back to the halls you were in earlier, but further down. Eventually you'll arrive at a lever, which will open a bridge back to the last bonfire. There's a chest further down, containing a [Magic Stone](/Magic+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Magic Stone") and a [Darknight Stone](/Darknight+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Darknight Stone"). Enter the room next to the chest . 

### Boss of the Aegis

Beneath stairs is a hallway with a [Hollow](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") and a bell. Kill it without ringing the bell, then camp it until you kill two more [Hollows](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") that will attempt to activate the bell; the second will come from the left side, and after, the third one spawning next to the bell. Now that spawning [Pyromancers](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") are not a threat, proceed to the corner opposite to the bell to kill the [Ghost](/Roaming+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Roaming Soul") dropping another [Small Smooth & Silky Stone](/Small+Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth & Silky Stone"). If the bell is rung, the [Pyromancers](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") -that spawn by the pillars ahead- can be picked off with a bow from afar.

[pic 5]

Past them are 2 [Royal Knights](/Royal+Knights "Dark Souls 2 Royal Knights") and a non-respawning [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider"). There are two chests on each side of the fog gate:

  * On the right side: 
    * One chest contains [Poison Throwing Knife](/Poison+Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Poison Throwing Knife") x15 and the other chest contains a [Darknight Stone](/Darknight+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Darknight Stone").
  * On the left side: 
    * One chest contains [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch") x4 and the other has a [Fragrant Brach of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore").
    * You'll also find the [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne") summon sign here.

When ready, step through the mist to face the boss.

[pic 6]

BOSS FIGHT: [Velstadt, The Royal Aegis](/Velstadt,+The+Royal+Aegis "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt, The Royal Aegis")

### See you later Vendrick

After the boss is defeated, the doorway straight ahead leads to [King Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick"). Don't worry, the first time you pass him, he's content with walking in circles and will not retaliate until after the first few hits you get on him. Go down and around him to the item on the other side of the room. This is the [King's Ring](/King's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King's Ring"); now you can go in search of Giant souls to weaken [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick"), unless you prefer to do so now with his 32x defense stats -yeah, we wouldn't eaither.

[pic 7]

### Soul Farming Tips

After you kill [Velstadt](/Velstadt,+The+Royal+Aegis "Dark Souls 2 Velstadt, The Royal Aegis"), come back to this room with a good number of long range spells or arrows. Arrows work better for this purpose it is easier to aim, Do not kill the zombie that rings the bell in the previous area. Now run everything. The only ones that might follow you into the boss room is the knights, but they do not respawn. You can stand in the boss room and pick off the respawning [Leydia Pyromancers](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") for 750 souls each.

You can kill them with good arrows in 2-4 shots, they also drop pretty good items -you may want to equip gear that helps with your item discovery. If they stop respawning you can burn a bonfire ascetic, and will be harder to defeat but will also come better with drops.

If you're having a lot of PVP or you are using small white sign soapstone to farm Smooth and Silkies or souls here, exercise caution in this room since invaders will use the bell to summon spectres and make an easy kill out of you while you're in the middle of the enemy horde/spell storm.
