**The Lost Sinner** is a [Boss](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. The captive within the confines of Sinners' Rise, **The Lost Sinner** , perpetually inflicts punishment upon herself as atonement for the transgressions of her history. Her ultimate sin, attempting to reignite the First Flame, is considered by some as the gravest of sins. [Bosses](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses") are unique and challenging Enemies that drop [Boss Souls](/Boss+Souls "Dark Souls 2 Boss Souls") capable of being transformed into powerful [Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons"), [Spells](/Spells "Dark Souls 2 Spells"), and [Items](/Items "Dark Souls 2 Items") for the player.

### Lost Sinner Information in Dark Souls 2

She is located deep after the Lost Bastille and into Sinners' Rise, in a dark cell that you may illuminate if you have obtained the [Bastille Key](/Bastille+Key "Dark Souls 2 Bastille Key") from the Belfry Gargoyles or the corpse at the edge of the broken bridge if you are playing the SotFS edition.   
  

  * _Prisoner of Sinners' Rise, the Lost Sinner eternally punishes herself for the sins of her past. Indeed, she committed what some would believe to be the ultimate sin - she attempted to relight the First Flame._
  * _The Lost Sinner possesses the[Soul of a Great One](/Old+Witch+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Old Witch Soul"); she holds the remnants of the Soul of the [Old Witch of Izalith](/Old+Witch+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Old Witch Soul").

### NPC Summons

[Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah") can be summoned for this encounter, provided the player exhausts her dialogue at the [Tower Apart](/The+Tower+Apart "Dark Souls 2 The Tower Apart"). Her summon sign is located at the bottom of the chain lift that takes the player down from the [Saltfort](/The+Saltfort "Dark Souls 2 The Saltfort").   
In the SotFS Edition, [Sellsword Luet](/Sellsword+Luet "Dark Souls 2 Sellsword Luet") can be summoned for this encounter. His summon sign is inside a cell just at the side of one of the exploding mummies.

### Strategy

You should first kill the [Belfry Gargoyle](/Belfry+Gargoyle "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Gargoyle") and proceed past them to a bonfire and a ladder that gives you the [Bastille Key](/Bastille+Key "Dark Souls 2 Bastille Key"). (In SOTFS you do not need to kill the Gargoyles to get the key, see the Bastille Key page for details.) Bring a torch and use the key to open the cells before the mist, and light the oil tracks on each side. This will lighten up the room and allow you to lock on. A video of this is provided below. ALTERNATE OPTION: The sorcery spell Cast Light can also be used if you want to attempt her before the Belfry; it will light up the room enough to get locked on from a decent range, and it will remain on if you cast the spell just before the fog wall into her area.  
  
Stick close to her body, constantly circling her. Wait for her to do a lunging thrust and after you should have time to get a hit or two in. Repeat. Take your time. Stamina management is key if you're using heavy weapons such as greatswords. If you're in a position where she is open to attack but you're low on stamina due to dodging a few of her attacks, you should just let it pass and wait for a new window. Always make sure to attack when you know your swing won't deplete your stamina completely so you can't dodge her follow-up. A shield with 100 physical reduction, such as the Drangleic Shield, can prove extremely helpful.   
  
**Co-op**   
The boss fight can be much easier if one person (either the host or phantom) has a [Redeye Ring](/Redeye+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Redeye Ring") and a Drangleic shield (If you have the [Gyrm Shield](/Gyrm+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Greatshield") or [Havel's Greatshield](/Havel%27s+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Havel%27s Greatshield"), this works great against the pyromancers in NG+ as well). The objective is to have whoever has the redeye ring to distract the boss, while the other kills the boss. This can work with NG+, the pyromancers have to be killed by the summoner. But as long as the bait has a shield up at all times, keeping their stamina up, the boss fight should be significantly easier.   
  
**Melee (no shield):**   
The Lost Sinner is a tricky and dangerous boss; her attacks have large swing arcs and the tracking on her thrust attack make things difficult too. The lock-on tends to not follow her fast enough and the boss sometimes retreats to walls causing the camera to act dodgy. Dodging the Lost Sinner is manageable, however, hitting her is difficult. She has few openings: After the third attack of a string (overheard and stab finishers), and side attack+overhead. The previous two attacks should be baited by staying in medium range; contriving the AI is the key to getting hit without miscalculated risks and whiffing attacks. Attacking her after one attack or the stab attack might give the player a hit or the punish will whiff, resulting in a dangerous position where the player has to roll after an attack—rolling too early in this fight should be avoided.   
That aside, healing is a similar case too—heal after the overhead smash and prepare to roll if you were in medium range.   
  
**Melee (NG+):**   
The Lost Sinner in NG+ is identical to the first playthrough; highly aggressive and large hitboxes with hard-to-judge attacks (it is highly recommended to light the torches outside this fight with the Bastille Key), only this time, after a certain amount of her health has been taken off (roughly 1/3 - 1/2), two black-phantom pyromancers equipped with [Great Fireball](/Great+Fireball "Dark Souls 2 Great Fireball"), [Fire Orb](/Fire+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Fire Orb"), [Flame Swathe](/Flame+Swathe "Dark Souls 2 Flame Swathe"), [Lingering Flame](/Lingering+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Lingering Flame") and [Forbidden Sun](/Forbidden+Sun "Dark Souls 2 Forbidden Sun") accompany her. With Lucatiel to help out in this fight, and it is vital that you have her summoned, it can be made quite easy; simply equip the Red Eye Ring, bought from Sweet Shalquior in Majula, and the Lost Sinner will spend the entire fight focused on you. The two pyromancers will most likely be provoked to attack you as well, but from a distance, and as long as they are kept at bay (with a 100% physical shield and high fire DEF—Gyrm Greatshield suggested), Lucatiel will handle the pyromancers with high damage, as she does not affect the Sinner greatly, and the Sinner will remain attacking you, leaving Lucatiel available to help with the singular fight against the sinner with a moderate/high amount of health, and will still be focused on you. Use any large swing opening from the Sinner to heal, and ensure that you manage your endurance well, circling and only putting the guard up when necessary. Rolling is also, like in the first playthrough, vital.   
  
**Melee (Drakewing Ultra Greatsword):**   
The Lost Sinner can be easily staggered and damaged with the use of [Drakewing Ultra Greatsword](/Drakewing+Ultra+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Drakewing Ultra Greatsword") buffed with [Dark Pine Resin](/Dark+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pine Resin"). Make sure the torches in the room have been lit, and once she has swung for one to two times, land the two-handed strong attack at melee, this will both stagger her and deal a high amount of damage to her (approximately 900-1,500), remember to dodge her attacks by rolling to the right instead of blocking.

**Pyro-tank:** This is a NG+ strategy that mostly revolves around being able to ignore the pyromancers. You want to max out your fire resistance by using the [Hexer's set](/Hexer's+set "Dark Souls 2 Hexer's set"), which has the highest fire res in game, a [Flame Quartz Ring](/Flame+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flame Quartz Ring") (preferably +3), the [Dispelling Ring](/Dispelling+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Dispelling Ring"), [Great Magic Barrier](/great+magic+barrier "Dark Souls 2 great magic barrier"), and (if possible) the [Ring Of Giants](/ring+of+giants "Dark Souls 2 ring of giants")+2. This setup should allow that you ignore the pyromancers entirely and just keep your attention on the sinner. Beware though not dodging the spells can leave you blind at moments as the explosions from the fire balls will likely block your vision. The lighting of the room may or may not be necessary as melee users will find themselves able to keep a lock on the sinner at most times but ranged might have more trouble without it. (If there are any issues with this strategy contact the user "ChildrenOfDark" and it will be adjusted accordingly)

  
**Attacks to be wary of:**

  * Stab: Large hitbox, good tracking of the player--don't roll early.
  * Jump: Two attacks, either an attack that is followed by a string, or an empty jump followed by a stab. Generally, MOVE AWAY. You can punish the attack if she doesn't initiate the follow up.
  * Critical: If you place your back to her, she will be able to back stab you for a large amount of damage. The same applies if she guard breaks you.
  * Fast sideways slash canceled by a dodge: This attack is tricky, and will mostly be used against the player after punishing her attacks. The attack can whiff if you stay to the right and strafe that way.

### Lost Sinner Hints

  * The room where you fight the Lost Sinner can be lit up, causing the boss to slow down. To light the room, you must first acquire the [Bastille Key](/Bastille+Key "Dark Souls 2 Bastille Key"). In the original version it can be obtained after defeating the [Belfry Gargoyles](/Belfry+Gargoyle "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Gargoyle"), but in the Scholar of the First Sin edition you can easily find it at the edge of the broken bridge after the Servant's Quarter bonfire. After getting the key, the two doors on either side of the entrance to the Lost Sinner can be unlocked, allowing the player to light up the oil and light the room.
  * It is possible to use [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah") to help with this fight, although she doesn't provide much damage to the boss. She is useful mainly as a distraction. Clear the watery path to boss first by killing the Water Giants and Exploding Mummies. Open the gate, then head back to the chain lift and touch her summon sign while human. With her summoned, run straight to the boss fog gate. She will enter shortly after you do and proceed to help with the battle.
  * It is also possible to summon Sellsword Luet as a Phantom from the final cell on the right hand upper floor before approaching the boss room. Since he only caries two shields, he doesn't do much damage, but he is still useful for drawing the bosses attention, though because still attempts to attack the boss with his shields, he often get hit so he won't last that long. (Scholar of the First Sin only)
  * In New Game +, two [Prisoned Sinners](/Prisoned+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Prisoned Sinner") (red phantom pyromancers) appear in the room when the Lost Sinner drops to around 60% health.
    * This occurs in NG+ however the pyromancers do not appear with the use of a Bonfire Ascetic in NG (SotFS: This does not apply, they appear in NG+.)
    * The phantoms have a small amount of health so they can be killed fast with a strong attack.
  * In New Game + Try to get Lucatiel to have all of the Lost Sinner's Aggro before attempting to kill the pyromancers.
  * It is possible to parry The Lost Sinner, however the stun window is miniscule and she will more than likely recover faster or as fast as you do.
