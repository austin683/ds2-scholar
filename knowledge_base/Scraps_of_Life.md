**Scraps of Life** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> "An esoteric spell created by Navlaan, the infamous exiled sorcerer.  
> Awakens the souls of the long-buried dead.  
>   
> The heretic Navlaan was executed along with his entire village, and the mere utterance of his name became a crime. Some say it was because he sought to restore the banned art of resurrection.  
>   
> Catalyst: Sacred Chime"

### Acquired From

  * Can be found in [The Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch") in front of the first Giant Worm, in a pot down the path from the Black Gulch Mouth Bonfire, or bought from [Cromwell the Pardoner](/Cromwell+the+Pardoner "Dark Souls 2 Cromwell the Pardoner") for 2200 souls.

### Notes

  * Sends out a purple circle on the ground and then shoots up pillars of black flames for 7 seconds dealing damage and knocking down smaller foes, similar to [Firestorm](/Firestorm "Dark Souls 2 Firestorm").
  * Using the Lingering Dragoncrest Ring increases the length of time the pillars stay.  
The description of this spell is nothing like the actual effect of this spell, which made it questionable what it was able to do before, though it indicated the origin of [Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan").
  * Does not reanimate any corpse in the same manner as [Hollow Mage (Black)](/Hollow+Mage+%28Black%29 "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Mage %28Black%29").  
  

  * Has great uses in PvP skirmishes and can be chained indefinitely depending on the opponent's roll distance and agility. Can be used as a wake-up after the opponent has been backstabbed, riposted, or knocked flat. It is possible to stand within the casting area and not be damaged as it is the pillars of smoke that do damage, however, this is usually rather hard to do.
