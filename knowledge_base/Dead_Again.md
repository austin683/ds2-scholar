**Dead Again** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> "Hex that casts a dark flame upon corpses, causing them to combust violently.  
>   
> Hexes such as these, that tamper with life itself, are particularly abhorred.  
>   
> Catalyst: staff"

### Acquired From

  * Rare drop from the two huge worms found in the Black Gulch.
  * Bought from [Stone Trader Chloanne](/Stone+Trader+Chloanne "Dark Souls 2 Stone Trader Chloanne") for 4,000 souls

### Notes

  * The spell only affects the corpses of slain enemies. Upon casting, a dark wave is sent out from the caster. Any undead/hollow corpses caught in the area will have an orb of purple light glow above them, then explode for a large amount of damage.
  * Between the start of casting the spell and corpses exploding can take three seconds, requiring good timing from the caster to avoid interruption or death.  
Once the dark wave is sent out the caster can move as normal, and a second later the corpses will explode. Multiple corpses can explode dealing additional damage.
  * Can be very effective to create traps using dead bodies.
