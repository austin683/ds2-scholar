_"A mask/robe/manchettes/tights honoring an ancient goddess. Sin was said to be her domain, but the name of the goddess is long forgotten."_

_"Little is known about what purpose the mask/robe/manchettes/tights served, only that it was worn by a person of great authority."_

### Location

  * The full [Judgement Set](/Judgment+Set "Dark Souls 2 Judgment Set") can be found after the first Drakekeeper in the [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine"). After you killed him, there are boxes and behind them is a Pharros' Contraption. Activate this, and a magic wall appears on the side wall. Break it and open the chest for the Judgement set and the Staff of Wisdom.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Judgement Set](/Judgment+Set "Dark Souls 2 Judgment Set").
  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * The appearance and item description of this set indicates that these were the clothes worn by [Cromwell the Pardorner](/Cromwell+the+Pardoner "Dark Souls 2 Cromwell the Pardoner") and **Oswald of Carim** , in the previous game - Oswald is an NPC with the ability to absolve a player of Sin.
