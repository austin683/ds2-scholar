### Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite Usage:

  * Reinforce special equipment up to +5

### Twinkling Titanite Locations in DKS2:

  * 3 Sold by [Stone Trader Chloanne](/Stone+Trader+Chloanne "Dark Souls 2 Stone Trader Chloanne") after obtaining the [King's Ring](/King's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King's Ring"). She can also give you a twinkling titanite when talking to her after spending 20,000 souls at her shop.
  * Can be traded for either Small Smooth & Silky Stone or Smooth and Silky Stone by [Dyna & Tillo](/Dyna+and+Tillo "Dark Souls 2 Dyna and Tillo") at [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt").
  * 1 inside the metal chest [blacksmith McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff") sits on in his workshop. Light the torch in the workshop to move him off of it
  * 1 on a dead body in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") after purchasing the ladder for 2000 souls from [Laddersmith Gilligan.](/Laddersmith+Gilligan "Dark Souls 2 Laddersmith Gilligan") (You can drop down with the cat ring and at least 15 Vigor, I believe more.)
  * 1 in an iron chest in [Iron Keep,](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") behind the second Archer Captain on a, which you have to climb a ladder to reach.
  * 1 on a corpse in the [Shaded Ruins](/Shaded+Ruins "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Ruins") guarded by four basilisks (3 in NG+ and onward can be farmed here using bonfire ascetics, however, the boss will need to be killed).
  * 1 in a chest at [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros"), first Pharros' contraption on the right after going up the ladder will unlock a path below it with a chest containing one and a [Faint Stone](/Faint+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Faint Stone").
  * 1 on a corpse in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). From the Chapel Threshold bonfire, go out the exit toward Prowling Magus fight, take a right, drop down onto the ledge with the crystal lizard, and turn around to find another ledge with the treasure. Use [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") to fall to the ground. Watch out for homing magic.
  * 1 in a chest in [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"), in the middle level of a tower, reachable by jumping off a narrow ledge before you get invaded by Melinda the Butcher. (Is a Mimic in SoTFS and contains Lightning Winged Spear, Dark Armor, and no twinkles)
  * 2 on corpses in Drangleic Castle. The first in the room with the poison dart faces and the second in [King's Passage](/King%27s+Passage "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Passage"), just before the [Mirror Knight](/Mirror+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Mirror Knight").
  * 1 on a corpse in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana"). After the first bonfire, open the door down the first set of stairs and attack the branch holding the glowing item just outside the door. The ore will drop down into the water where it can be picked up once you go down the spiral staircase and take a right.
  * 1 in the chest in [Shrine of Amana.](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana") In the cave before the second bonfire with 4 lizardmen guarding it. (does not respawn)
  * _**Unlimited farming:**_ 7 from the crystal lizards in the Dragon nests in Dragon Aerie. If you can kill or avoid the dragons, farming this place with Bonfire Ascetics will get you a ton of upgrade materials. (NOTE: If you kill the dragons they might **drop** twinkling titanite which may make it seem like the twinkling drops from the lizards are random but they're not.) One of the titanites is located down on a dead-end ledge, which is just next to the endpoint of the zipline, which leads back to the bonfire. In SOTFS There is a Bonfire Ascetic in the cave which is directly after the bonfire.
  * 1(3 in NG+) found in a wooden chest at [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine"), up the stairs to the left of the first Drakekeeper wielding a Giant mace. (Note: This chest is guarded by another Drakekeeper. If you aren't careful, the Drakekeeper's swings may break it).
  * 2 on a corpse located just before the [Memory of Jeigh](/Memory+of+Jeigh "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Jeigh"), in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). Just before accessing the memory, drop down on the left. This corpse is useful for farming twinkling titanite via Bonfire Ascetics, however you do need to kill the [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord"). Thankfully, there is also Bonfire Ascetic located within the memory, so you can essentially farm this area infinitely. Scholar of the First Sin, the Titanite no longer respawns.
  * 3 on a corpse in [Shulva - Sanctum City](/Shulva+-+Sanctum+City "Dark Souls 2 Shulva - Sanctum City").
  * _**Unlimited farming:**_ 3 in a wooden chest in [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon%27s+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Sanctum"), in the hallway, you reach after passing the first two Sanctum Knights and their bodies and past the trap room with the Sanctum Soldiers and Dark Witch, you enter the hallway after going through the circle mechanism, go in the room to your left after you jump over the hole in the floor. Be careful of the soldier around the corner and the spike trap on the floor at the top of the stairs - it'll trigger spears from the wall along the stairwell down, but you can also use it to lure the two enemies who will chase you up the stairs. The chest will be on the right at the bottom of the stairs. Also contains 3 [Petrified Dragon Bones](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). Fantastic farming place here because there is a wooden chest before this one with an ascetic (the SOTFS version does not have the ascetic in this chest anymore) in it, hence you can keep doing it as many times as you'd like. Make sure you use the ascetic on the Tower of Prayer bonfire. You might also want to pick up the two large souls and the repair powder on your farming run as well, as they're also respawned by the ascetic and are along the route.
  * 2 on a corpse in [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon%27s+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Sanctum") on the spiked surface.
  * 6 total on 2 corpses in [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon%27s+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Sanctum") near the last set of Drakeblood Knights.
  * 2 on a corpse in the tower where you retrieve the [Scorching Iron Scepter](/Scorching+Iron+Scepter "Dark Souls 2 Scorching Iron Scepter").
  * 2 on a corpse in [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower") after activating the elevators and going down two levels near where you find the Tower Key.
  * 3 in a wooden chest in [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower") after the Upper Floor bonfire. (Can be farmed with bonfire ascetics from the foyer bonfire; third one)

### Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite Drops from

  * 1 dropped by a (non-respawning) Flexile Sentry just before the [Shrine of Winter](/Shrine+of+Winter "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Winter"), on the eastern path away from the Ruined Fork Road bonfire in the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods").
  * Drops from [Archdrake Pilgrim](/Archdrake+Pilgrim "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Pilgrim") and [Amana Priestesses](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") in the [Shrine of Amana.](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana")
    * Since Patch 1.10 allows for infinite respawns while in the [Company of Champions](/Company+of+Champions "Dark Souls 2 Company of Champions"), killing Archdrake Pilgrims and Amana Priestesses is probably the best way to farm Twinkling Titanite without the use of [Ascetics](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic").
  * 1 dropped from the Pursuer encountered in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt") (SoTFS, in the shore with Ogres found after the petrified statue).
