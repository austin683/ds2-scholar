## Doors of Pharros Enemies

  

  

###  [Entity of Avarice](/Entity+of+Avarice)

  

A monster which looks like (mimics) a regular chest but will attack the player when opened or struck. The mimic will gobble up any player standing close to it, a move which deals high damage and can kill a player outright. 

  

  

###  [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard)

  

_A timid species of sparkling reptile cloaked in total mystery. These strange creatures possess a variety of useful, and valuable, stones. These creatures are not well understood, as the procurement of specimens for study is an all-but-futile endeavor; Crystal Lizards are masters of escape and have a marked tendency to do so before anyone can get close enough to catch them.1_

  

  

###  [Gyrm Worker](/Gyrm+Worker) (Gyrm)

  

_A stocky, powerful race which once dwelt aboveground, they were regarded as inferior by humans and unjustly exiled below. They are amicable by nature but harbor an intense distrust of surface-dwellers, particularly humans; in addition many of the Gyrm living in the Doors of Pharros have gone Hollow and become threats to the living._   
  
  
See also: [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior)

  

  

###  [Mongrel Rat](/Mongrel+Rat) (Dog Rat)

  

_Subjects of the Rat King, the origins of these odd hybrid canine rats remain unknown to all but the rats themselves. They inhabit the Doors of Pharros and will bravely defend their rightful realm against intruders._

  

  

###  [Hollow Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight) (Primal Knight)

  

Giant mastadon-like knights. These heavy armor brutes comes in two variants: the Golden ones in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle) and the decayed rusted ones in [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros). They are all armed with giant Halberds.   
  
_One of the original Primal Knights, this ragged creature went Hollow long ago and now wanders mindlessly with its equipment in tatters from long years of neglect. First created through a dark and forbidden ritual in ages past, the Primal Knights are artificial creatures contrived by a twisted and power-hungry mind. Their susceptibility to the Undead Curse, a trait they share with humans, raises foreboding questions about the rituals through which they were given life..._

  

  

###  [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior)

  

_Warriors of the Gyrm race clad in heavy armor customized for their stout frames. These sturdy opponents can deal massive damage with their improvised Great Hammers while deflecting nearly any blow with the monstrous stone Greatshields they carry. Some have developed proficiency in ranged combat and will throw enormous Greataxes with frightening accuracy._   
  
They also seemed to have a rank system, normal [Gyrm](/Gyrm) does not wear heavy armor, they're also the blacksmiths of the Gyrm race, Gyrm Warriors wear heavy segmented armor and fire resistant stone shield paired with an axe or greathammer, Elite Gyrm Warriors can be identified by their [Gyrm Warrior Greathelm](/Gyrm+Warrior+Greathelm), a friendly Elite Gyrm Warrior named [Gavlan](/Gavlan) can be encounted throughhout the world, he's an item collector plus vender of poison equipments 

  

  

###  Dark Spirit - [Bowman Guthry](/Bowman+Guthry)

  

_A Dark Spirit with a most unusual choice of armaments. Guthry will invade in the Doors of Pharros immediately after the player has passed through the gate into the Rat King's territory. Clad in armor of a Royal Swordsman, could he be a remnant of the Drangleic Army unit dispatched to Brightstone Cove Tseldora…?_   
  
An NPC red phantom that invades in [Doors of Pharros](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Doors+of+Pharros) when the player is in offline mode.   
Dual-wields the [Avelyn](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Avelyn) crossbow but doesn't seem to have any close-ranged attack.   
He is very similar to one of the non-respawning [Bell Keepers](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Bell+Keeper) in [Belfry Sol](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Belfry+Sol) (the one on the roof).
