### Notes and Tips About Explorer

Notes: One of the weakest classes in terms of offense, they are almost on par with the Deprived despite being at level 10, and their item based special attacks are limited. Few of the items he has are ones that can't be obtained from early game merchants. However, the Pharros Lockstone may come in handy to open a treasure room, they do start with the highest Adaptablilty among all classes, so you may invest into a Dex. build if you want to have a character with decent dodging frame or climbing speed. Also, their 20 Lifegems are quite handy early on, that is until the moment when the merchants sell infinite Lifegems.

See [builds](/builds "Dark Souls 2 builds") for more information.
