### How to get Black Witch's Staff in Dark Souls 2

  * [Peculiar Kindalur](/Peculiar+Kindalur "Dark Souls 2 Peculiar Kindalur")
  * [Leydia Witch](/Leydia+Witch "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Witch")
  * [Mimic](/Entity+of+Avarice "Dark Souls 2 Entity of Avarice") drop in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep") (trapped in a cage in the Main Hall)

### DS2 Black Witch's Staff Hints and Tips

  * This staff can be used to cast [sorceries](/sorceries "Dark Souls 2 sorceries"), [miracles](/miracles "Dark Souls 2 miracles") and **all** [hexes](/hexes "Dark Souls 2 hexes"), making it the most versatile staff in the game.

  * Extremely useful for allowing multiple different utility/buffs across all forms of sorcery with only using 1 slot in your equipment screen. Since buffs do not scale in Dark Souls 2, this staff is perfect as a non-primary utility/buff casting option on the go. ("Utility" as in useful for **all** non-offensive forms of sorcery like repair, hush, force, great magic shield, resonant flesh and others if the player does not want to use this as a primary sorcery option or any use magic but just wants to buff.)
  * You can also infuse the staff to make it be dedicated to specific magic, for instance infuse with [Darknight Stone](/Darknight+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Darknight Stone") to make it Hex dedicated, and [Faintstone](/Faintstone "Dark Souls 2 Faintstone") to make it Sorcery dedicated.
  * Dark Black Witch's Staff is actually a decent staff for hexers, while being inferior to [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff"), the ability of casting both Hex Miracle and Hex Sorcery cannot be overlooked, and it's actually superior to Dark [Idol's Chime](/Idol%27s+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Idol%27s Chime").
  * Thanks to the staff's versatility, you can perform extremely powerful combos that are impossible with normal staves.
  * A notable surprise tactic is to use this staff to cast [Profound Still](/Profound+Still "Dark Souls 2 Profound Still") and then go for other spell casting to gain advantage over caster opponents.
  * However, even after infusion, the scaling is inferior to [Lizard Staff](/Lizard+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Lizard Staff"), [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff") and [Staff of Wisdom](/Staff+of+Wisdom "Dark Souls 2 Staff of Wisdom").
  * Although inferior magic infused with 52 int still grant 441 magic bns, only 53 less than a magic staff of wisdom
  * The sheer varieties and combinations of spells you can cast with the Black Witch's Staff mitigates for the inferior scaling however.
  * Lightning scaling reaches B upon +10, but it cannot be infused with [Boltstone](/Boltstone "Dark Souls 2 Boltstone"), meaning that it is not quite as good as a lightning miracle chime.
  * curiosity testing showed that the staff produced a staff striking sound when functioning as a chime for many miracles and hex based miracles.
  * [Sanctum Shield](/Sanctum+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Shield") shares similiar feature of this staff, can be used for casting sorceries, miracles and all hexes as well, but the scaling is inferior to this staff.
  * Oddly, the bashing damage of this staff is actually quite decent due to its multiple attack values bonus.
  * The staff has fire damage and scaling which is odd considering it can't cast pyromancies.

  * Note: Requires normal titanite shards to upgrade. Enchantable with faintstone or darkstone.
  * Note: Efficient for using hexes, given how it works as both a chime and a staff.
