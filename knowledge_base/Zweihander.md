### How to get Zweihander in Dark Souls 2

**DARK SOULS II - ORIGINAL**

  * Treasure in the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"): When you get to the [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon") boss fog, turn around and run straight (towards the same direction as the [Dull Ember](/Dull+Ember "Dark Souls 2 Dull Ember")), jump over a small gap and continue to the iron chest at the end. The chest contains the Zweihander.
  * Common drop from [Ducal Spider](/Ducal+Spider "Dark Souls 2 Ducal Spider") in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora").

  
**SCHOLAR OF THE FIRST SIN EDITION**

  * At the same relative area as before, but now you have to jump at the broken iron staircase at your right (the [Dull Ember](/Dull+Ember "Dark Souls 2 Dull Ember") **WAS** there before...) and ascend the ladder inside. There is a iron chest at the top with the weapon.
  * Common drop from Ducal Spider in Brightstone Cove Tseldora.

### DS2 Zweihander Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10
  * Good for hitting large groups of enemies and hard hits when needed.
  * The 2-Handed thrust attack IS launch-capable, and will throw humanoid enemies a few feet and knock them down, if it doesn't kill them outright.
  * Due to it's incredibly long range and large arcing sweeps with low stat requirements, an infused Zweihander with a weapon buff , in the right hands makes it an incredibly versatile weapon for PVP.
  * One of the two lightest Ultra Greatswords, the others being [Drakewing Ultra Greatsword](/Drakewing+Ultra+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Drakewing Ultra Greatsword").
  * The Zweihander has a respectable stability and physical-block-percentage for a weapon (as opposed to a shield), making it viable for defensive use when two-handing.
  * The 2-handed "golf swings" are susceptible to parrying.
