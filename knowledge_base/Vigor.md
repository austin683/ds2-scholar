**Vigor** is an [Attribute](/Stats "Dark Souls 2 Stats") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **Vigor** determines your character's Health and Petrify Resistance. Attributes can be increased by assigning points into them when [Leveling Up](/Level "Dark Souls 2 Level").

### Vigor Information

  * An attribute that determines health points ([HP](/HP "Dark Souls 2 HP")).
  * **Raises HP** : 30 per point (0-20), 20 per point (21-50), 5 HP per point (51-99).
  * **Raises petrify resistance (PR)** : 0.25 PR per point (0-25), 0.65 per point (26-99).
  * Note: Base HP at 0 Vigor is 500 HP
  * The Swordsman begins with the lowest Vigor at 4 and the Knight starts with the highest Vigor at 12.
  * Your maximum HP will diminish by 5% every time you die up until it caps at 50% of your maximum HP. Using a   
[Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") will remove this penalty until you die again, bringing you back to 95% of your maximum HP and so on.
  * Being summoned (White Soapstone or Small White Soapstone) and fulfilling your duty will also restore your humanity and Maximum HP%.
  * Being Cursed will reduce your maximum HP by 5% without killing you, while Petrification will kill you and reduce your maximum HP by 20% instead of 5%.
