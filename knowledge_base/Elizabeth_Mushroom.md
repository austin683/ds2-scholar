### Dark Souls 2 Elizabeth Mushroom Location

  * 1 In a waterlogged chest in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana") near the first bonfire.
  * 1 In a chest after defeating the [Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner").
  * 3 under a table in the hallway near the Ritual Site bonfire on NG+. These can be respawned repeatedly and farmed using bonfire ascetics (need confirmation)
  * 3 Underneath the first dragon in [Dragon Aerie](/Dragon+Aerie "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Aerie") on NG+.
  * 3 In an iron chest in [Eleum Loyce](/Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Eleum Loyce") near the area with the ballistas.
  * 13 Sold by [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne") for 4500 souls.
  * Very rare drop from Dragon Acolytes in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep"). Unsure whether it is only drop-able by the first one in the painting or all of them. (I have had them drop from the Acolytes in the room with the Giant Bug) Dropped at bonfire intensity 5. (Untrue, using Company of Champions, killing them in normal NG caused them to drop) Another dropped from the Acolyte that examines the corrosive creature (I got a couple from that one on NG+).
  * 2 on a corpse in Frozen Eleum Loyce behind a one-way door near the area with several Ice Rapier wielding monsters.
