### Acquired From

  * Acquired from [Blue Sentinels](/Blue+Sentinels "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinels") (Rank 3).
  * Sold by [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") on NG++ for 11,000 souls; Bonfire Ascetics do **not** apply.

### Bountiful Sunlight Notes

  * Holding down the cast button will allow you to "hold" the spell for any amount of time unless interrupted by an attack. Releasing the button will cast it.
  * The casting AoE is massive, but the health restored is only 7/sec (as compared to 14/sec for resplendent life).
  * Can be used for healing [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Knight") during an invasion.
