## Dark Chasm of Old Enemies

  

  

###  [Dark Spirit - Abyss Ironclad](/Dark+Spirit+-+Abyss+Ironclad)

  

Dual wields giant [Drakekeeper's Great Hammers ](/Drakekeeper%27s+Great+Hammer)in an attempt to pummel the player to smithereens. The best tactic against him is to fire magic projectiles from afar, since he is limited to close range combat and can't block. 

  

  

###  [Dark Spirit - A Chip Off the Ol' Rock](/Dark+Spirit+-+A+Chip+Off+the+Ol%27+Rock)

  

A carbon copy of Havel the Rock from Dark Souls, he wields the [Dragon Tooth](/Dragon+Tooth) and tries to pound you into the ground. He is also weak to ranged magic, having no ranged attacks and only using his melee weapon. 

  

  

###  [Dark Spirit - Shadowveil Assassin](/Dark+Spirit+-+Shadowveil+Assassin)

  

Yet another of the pilgrims traversing the Dark Chasm, its face is obscured beneath a shadowy hood. Its wicked and murderous armaments raise many questions about the intentions, and the sanity, of those who walk the Dark. 

  

  

###  [Dark Spirit - Pretender to the Xanthous Throne](/Dark+Spirit+-+Pretender+to+the+Xanthous+Throne)

  

A traveler of the Dark Chasm of Old, this Dark Spirit casts an unmistakable shadow and attacks with an array of deadly Pyromancy. But could it really be...? 

  

  

  

###  [Dark Spirit - Tenebrous Rogue](/Dark+Spirit+-+Tenebrous+Rogue)

  

One of many pilgrims wandering the Dark Chasm of Old, this unidentified Dark Spirit wields a Bandit's Knife and Mytha's Bent Blade; a tattered hood conceals its malevolent face. Who are these nameless explorers of the Dark, and what do they hope to gain when their pilgrimages reach an end? 

  

  

###  [Dark Spirit - The Ghost of Princes Past](/Dark+Spirit+-+The+Ghost+of+Princes+Past)

  

Though at first glance this netherwold traveler might appear nondescript and mundane, its lightning fast sword technique tells a different story. Who is this nimble warrior of shadow and from whom did he learn this deadly art? The mysteries of the Dark Chasm are as numerous as the murderous eyes glinting from its shadowy corners. 

  

  

###  [Dark Spirit - Underworld Deadeye](/Dark+Spirit+-+Underworld+Deadeye)

  

An explorer of the Dark whose visage lies concealed by the monocle of [Durgo's Hat](/Durgo%27s+Hat). Whether this is in fact the legendary archer himself is uncertain. After all, what could so noble a hero hope to gain from lurking the dark depths? 

  

  

###  [Witchtree](/Witchtree)

  

_A ghostly entity that drifts through the Dark Chasm. Although its true nature and origins are entirely obscure, its twisted root-like appearance is somehow familiar..._
