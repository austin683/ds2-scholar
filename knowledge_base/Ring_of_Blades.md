**Ring of Blades** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in **Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)**. The **Ring of Blades** , fashioned after the weapon of the mad knight of Alken, amplifies physical attack. Once, the kingdoms of Alken and Venn thrived on these grounds, both founded by the same individual but eventually consumed by rivalry and animosity. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> The Ring of Blades is modeled after the mad knight of Alken's weapon of choice. Increases physical attack. The kingdoms of Alken and Venn long ago flourished on these very grounds. They were both founded by the same man, but were reduced to rivalry and spite.

### Ring of Blades Locations in Dark Souls 2

  * Obtained by defeating the boss [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants").
  * +1: Obtained by defeating the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") within [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") in the [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon")'s room. The [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") will spawn after [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon") is defeated, but one must rest at a bonfire/re-enter the area first. (The [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") does NOT have to be defeated.) (You will also not obtain the Ring if he dies while you get summoned.)
  * +2: Obtained by defeating the two mini boss [Pursuers](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") throne room on NG+. (Can be done via [bonfire ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at [King's Gate](/King's+Gate "Dark Souls 2 King's Gate") bonfire)
  * The +2 variant will drop like a regular item. This means that if the player dies before picking the ring up, the item will despawn and be unavailable until the next NG cycle (or after using a Bonfire Ascetic). This issue can be avoided by ensuring that the Pursuer on the player's right is dispatched before the one on the left; this is because the one on the left will drop the ring. 

### DS2 Ring of Blades Tips and Notes

  * Increases ALL physical damage. This includes fists and bows.
  * As this ring does _**not**_ provide a percentage increase in damage, it is most effective with weapons that can attack rapidly, in order to proc the increased damage as often as possible.
  * The physical damage bonus provided by this ring is reduced proportionally to the physical damage reduction of the imbuement used for each individual weapon (typically 20%-30%). See the Imbuement section of the [Upgrades](/Upgrades#.U2fFJ8fHn-W "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades#.U2fFJ8fHn-W") page for more details.
  * At +2, this ring provides normal, raw and mundane infused weapons with +50 AR, bleed and poison infused weapons with innate bleed or poison with +40 AR, elemental infused weapons will receive +25 AR and weapons upgraded with [twinkling titianite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") or [petrified dragon bone](/petrified+dragon+bone "Dark Souls 2 petrified dragon bone") +35 AR. (not totally true, some information must be corrected and are currently under tests: for example as found so far the Poison infused weapons gain a +25 AR if they have no element or status natively, vice versa they gain a bonus AR around +38 but varying for some of those weapons).
