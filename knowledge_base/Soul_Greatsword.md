  * Creates a magic horizontal slash in the shape of a sword. Damage falls off at farther distances. Good for groups, but be wary of the windup.
  * Can hit through barriers like walls and railings. Great for taking out an enemy who thinks he is safe.
  * If the catalyst casting this spell is wielded in the left hand, the soul greatsword will swing from right to left, it is the opposite if wielded in the right hand.
  * If you cast Soul Greatsword at the right time before a back-stab animation your character will keep the Soul great-sword for the duration of the enemy's back-stab and if it touches your enemy at all it will do massive damage.
