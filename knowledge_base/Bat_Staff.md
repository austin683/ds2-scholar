**Bat Staff** is **[Staff](/Staves "Dark Souls 2 Staves")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. Bat Staff is a staff used by hollowed Drangleic sorcerers, serving as a catalyst for [Sorceries](/Sorceries "Dark Souls 2 Sorceries") and [Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes"). The **Bat Staff** , once imbued with Dark, becomes a hex-specialized version of the [Lizard Staff](/Lizard+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Lizard Staff") but with a slower casting speed. 

> Staff used by hollowed Drangleic sorcerers, A catalyst for sorceries and hexes.   
>   
>  The bat affixed to its tip is a simple charm. It has no bearing on the staff´s powers, but the germs on the cadaver poison foes upon contact in strike attacks. 

### How to get Bat Staff in Dark Souls 2

  * Drops from [Hollow Mage](/Hollow+Mage "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Mage") encountered in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora")

### DS2 Bat Staff Hints and Tips

  * _Staff bashing inflicts poison_ , also affected by [Sanctum Soldier Gauntlets](/Sanctum+Soldier+Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier Gauntlets") and [Crest of the Rat](/Crest+of+the+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Crest of the Rat"), although it isn't shown in the weapon stat due to the reason below.
  * Oddly, staff bashing from [Hollow Mage](/Hollow+Mage "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Mage") himself does not deal any poison buildup, contrary to the acquired staff.
  * Before Calibration Patch 1.06, it had poison damage and bonus which affected [Dark Fog](/Dark+Fog "Dark Souls 2 Dark Fog"), making it poison almost instantly. This is no longer the case.
  * Now, the staff no longer deals any poison damage while casting, but it still inflicts poison while bashing.
  * It acts as a hex dedicated version of [Lizard Staff](/Lizard+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Lizard Staff") if infused with Dark, but with a much slower casting speed.
  * In short, this staff is inferior to [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff") and [Black Witch's Staff](/Black+Witch%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch%27s Staff"), but the weight is same as Sunset Staff, slightly lighter than [Black Witch's Staff](/Black+Witch%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch%27s Staff").
  * 333 magic bonus with 50 int.
  * 384 dark with 30/30
