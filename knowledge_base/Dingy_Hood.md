_"An unassuming dingy hood._  
  
_Although by now gray with soot and nearly unraveled, its fabric was originally a pure white"_

### Location

  * New Game+: Dropped by Black Phantom NPC in a tunnel near the path to the Gutter, underneath the broken rope bridge in the Majula Pit.
  * Only obtainable in NG+, using a Bonfire Ascetic (at the second Bonfire of Grave of Saints, at least) will not cause the Black Phantoms to appear.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Dingy Set](/Dingy+Set).
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite+Slab).
  * Starts at +5 when obtained from NG+ Black Phantom.
