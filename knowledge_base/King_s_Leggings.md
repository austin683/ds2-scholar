**King's Leggings** is a **Legging** and a part of [King's Set](/King's+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### King's Leggings Description

"Leggings of Vendrick, King of Drangleic.

What makes a king?  
Some say that it is birthright,  
while others call it destiny.

Perhaps it is not important, as long as  
the king's name serves to unite his people."

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Found past the Crumbled Ruins bonfire in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana), behind the door on the left, past a narrow stone bridge guarded by a [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dragonrider"). The door only opens once [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Vendrick") is defeated and the player must be in human form to unlock the door (using [Ring of the Dead](/Ring+of+the+Dead "Ring of the Dead") won't do).

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite).
  * King's Crown grants +2 to VGR and VIT, +1 to INT and FTH, and reduces END, STR and DEX by -1.
  * Crown has the durability almost twice as high as any other item in the set.
  * Requires 14 STR and 12 DEX.
