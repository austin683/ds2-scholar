**Ruin Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Helmet/Armor/Gauntlets/Leggings worn by the jailer's creation, the Ruin Sentinel.  
>    
>  The sentinel has no form, its soul residing within the armor itself.  
> Stare at it for long and it seems ready to spring to life, but surely, such is an illusion.

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Ruin Sentinels](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"). 
    * Note: this set is a rare drop, so it's recommended to use equipment that raises drop rate or to join [Company of Champions](/Company+of+Champions "Dark Souls 2 Company of Champions") to have Sentinels respawning permanently.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Chestpiece offers second highest petrification resistance (equal to that of [Saint's](/Saint's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Saint's Set") robe).
  * Gauntlets offer second highest petrification resistance.
  * It is rumored that Ruin Helm's design took an homage to a headpiece in Armored Core: Verdict Day [reference pic removed – it's only showing Dark Souls 2 artwork; need relevant Armored Core pic].
