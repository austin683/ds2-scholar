**Silver Eagle Kite Shield** is a [standard shield](/standard+shields "Dark Souls 2 standard shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Medium-sized metal shield. A commonly-used, standard shield._

     _Has a pointed top designed for ease of use while on horseback."_

### Acquired From:

  * Buy from [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") for 1500 souls.

### Silver Eagle Kite Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * An easy to obtain shield that is good all around. It is useful if you haven't yet obtained, or you would rather keep your strength too low for the [Drangleic Shield](/Drangleic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Shield").
  * The rather light weight and 90% physical defense is also a good consideration until you get [Magic Shield](/Magic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Magic Shield").
  * This shield reappears in the sequel  _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Silver Eagle Kite Shield](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Silver+Eagle+Kite+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Silver Eagle Kite Shield").
