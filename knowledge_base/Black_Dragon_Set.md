**Black Dragon Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Eerily shaped helmet/armor/gauntlets/leggings spoken of in legend, crafted with the scales of the Black Dragon.  
>   
> The Black Dragon was long considered a mere legend, but this proves its existence.

###  Set Location
