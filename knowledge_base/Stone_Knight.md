### Dark Souls 2 Stone Knight Information

_Knights in the service of sir Velstadt, the Royal Aegis. When Velstadt left with Vendrick through the King's Passage the men under his command dutifully remained at their posts, awaiting his return for so long that they eventually turned to stone.1_   
  
Wearing heavy armor and a helmet resembling the head of a horse, these sleeping statues which won't activate until approached or attacked (from range). When activated, Stone Kights have glowing red eyes and wield twinblades. Even though the gear looks heavy, they are still very agile. They attack with combos which involve turns, jumps and kicks. They can be "destroyed" before they get up to attack, in which case they have less than half of their regular health, do not drop items and can be distinguished from actual statues by being the only ones with heads. They are found in [King's Passage](/King%27s+Passage "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Passage").
