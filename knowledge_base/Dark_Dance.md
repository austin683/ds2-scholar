**Dark Dance** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> Hex that unleashes a large mass of Dark. This momentous mass of Dark dances to signal the joy of its own release, or perhaps merely to taunt foes as it veers towards them.
> 
> Hexes are an expression of human depravity, of which this dance is a perfect example.
> 
> Catalyst: Sacred Chime

### Acquired From

  * Found just after the second bonfire of [Frozen Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Eleum Loyce") in the [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King") DLC. After defeating all the enemies in the first area, before climbing the first set of stairs, turn right and follow the snowy cliff face to a body with the hex on it.

### Notes

  * Consumes up to 5000 souls per cast.  
Emits a shockwave and unleashes between 1, 3, or 5 Dark masses depending on the amount of souls consumed, which simultaneously get fired at the target shortly after.
  * Similar to [Wrath of the Gods](/Wrath+of+the+Gods "Dark Souls 2 Wrath of the Gods") and [Homing Soul Mass](/Homing+Soul+Mass "Dark Souls 2 Homing Soul Mass") combined. Best to pair with a Dark Chime Of Want +5 and [Clear Bluestone Ring +2](/Clear+Bluestone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Clear Bluestone Ring"), Along with the Dark Clutch Ring and The Abyss seal for maximum damage.
  * Before 1.10 Calibration, multiple duplicates could be acquired with [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at the second bonfire, this is no longer the case.
