### Lifedrain Patch Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * This hex can harm the caster and their allies if they step into or very close to the sphere. The sphere does not last very long but does a considerable amount of damage and consumes 3,000 souls per use. Taking damage from this hex also deals stamina damage that increases with the number of souls that were used to cast it.
  * Can be useful if enemies are lured into a narrow space (such as a doorway), as it will force the enemies to pass through the Lifedrain Patch to get to the player.
  * A variant of this spell that inflicts curse is used by [Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra").
