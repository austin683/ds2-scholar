**Resplendent Life** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle.

> "A great miracle used by highly-ranked clerics.  
> Slowly restores a large amount of HP.  
>   
> Cleric Forsalle of Lindelt was a master of miracles who fought battles across the lands. His allies called him a holy knight, but his enemies feared him for his "demonic powers.""

### Resplendent Life Notes

  * Lasts for 60 seconds and heals 14 HP/sec. 
  * Heals the same total amount as [Replenishment](/Replenishment "Dark Souls 2 Replenishment") but in half the time and using two slots, making it situationally useful. 
  * Replaces [Replenishment](/Replenishment "Dark Souls 2 Replenishment") rather than stacking with it.
