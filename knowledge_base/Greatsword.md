### How to get Greatsword in Dark Souls 2

  * Sold by [Head of Vengarl](/Head+of+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Head of Vengarl") for 5000 Souls in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods").
  * Treasure in [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man%27s Wharf"): Find an iron chest near [Gavlan](/Lonesome+Galvan "Dark Souls 2 Lonesome Galvan"). (Not in SotFS, it's in the iron chest above the room filled with Darkdwellers.)
  * Dropped by Knight enemies in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle").
  * +3 version dropped by the [red phantom](/Greatsword+Phantom "Dark Souls 2 Greatsword Phantom") outside of the [Executioners Chariot](/Executioners+Chariot "Dark Souls 2 Executioners Chariot") boss.

### DS2 Greatsword Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Regulation 1.08 updated this weapon to have S STR Scalling at +10. At Normal +10 with 50 Strength and 10 required Dexterity, this weapon has an attack rating of 579. 629 with [Ring of Blades +2](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades").
  * Be wary of using this in tight hallways. In the current game build, if you are auto-targeting and backpedaling, you will attack in the direction you are walking and not the direction you are facing.
  * **Trivia** : Guts from Berserk (anime/manga) uses an giant two-handed sword similar to this one, called the Dragonslayer. The Greatsword is most likely a reference due to the developers loving the Berserk series. Players looking for another Ultra Greatsword like the Dragonslayer could try the [Crypt Blacksword](/Crypt+Blacksword "Dark Souls 2 Crypt Blacksword"), although that requires NG+ or using a Bonfire Ascetic and is also shorter and wider than the original Dragonslayer.
  * You need 42 str and 15 dex to powerstance both of them.
