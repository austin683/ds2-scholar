**Level** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** is an overall representation of your character's collective attributes and abilities. [Stats](/Stats "Dark Souls 2 Stats") define the strengths and weaknesses of your character, as well as their ability to wield armaments and magic. There are eight (9) attributes that the player can increase by acquiring and spending [Souls](/Souls "Dark Souls 2 Souls"). For every point an attribute is raised the player's overall level increases.

  * See [Souls](/Souls "Dark Souls 2 Souls") for details on acquiring souls and soul acquisition boosting equipment.
  * See [Stats](/Stats "Dark Souls 2 Stats") for a rundown of attribute points, attack power, damage negation, and all other player stats.

### How to Level Up in Dark Souls 2

Before encountering [Emerald Herald](/Emerald+Herald "Dark Souls 2 Emerald Herald"), you are maidenless. She offers a deal to play the role of a maiden for you, beseeching you to collect Souls so that she may convert them into power for you. Accepting her offer unlocks the ability to level up

Leveling up requires spending [Souls](/Souls "Dark Souls 2 Souls"), the universal currency of **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. Souls are acquired by defeating Enemies, conquering Bosses, and exploring the different locations. Be warned that dying will drop all of your currently held souls. They can be retrieved by returning to the site of your death. However, dying once more before retrieving your lost souls will cause you to lose them forever.

After spending souls to raise an attribute, its effects are represented by blue or red values, increases and decreases respectively, in the **Base Stats** , **Attack Power** , **Defense Power** , or **Body** categories.

Raising your level will also gradually increase your overall defensive stats, in addition to the bonuses provided by the stats you're increasing.
