**Fire Storm** is a [Pyromancy](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Fire Storm** , an ancient and primal pyromancy that generates pillars of flame around the caster. [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") are offensive fire spells that do not demand [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith") or [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") prerequisites and can be executed with a [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") or [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame"). The fire damage scales with [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"), yet there are no specific stat requirements for casting pyromancies. However, opponents resistant to fire damage remain unaffected by [Pyromancy Spells](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies").

> The Firestorm is said to be the wrath and ire of the spell's creator."
