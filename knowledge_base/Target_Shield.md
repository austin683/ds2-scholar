**Target Shield** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

  

     _"Small metal shield with protrusions._

     _Small shields are very light and easy to use, but are not very stable when attacked._

     _The protrusions on the center of the shield are designed to brush attacks aside and make parrying easier."_

### Acquired From:

  * Hidden behind a wall in the [Ruin Sentinels](/Ruin+Sentinel "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Sentinel") boss room.

### Target Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * The chest containing the target shield can be destroyed through the wall by the wide swings of the bosses during the fight, resulting in a pile of rubbish in place of the shield.
  * A shield that specializes in parrying much like the [Buckler](/Buckler "Dark Souls 2 Buckler") shield.
  * The Target Shield appears in both _[Dark Souls](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Target+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Target Shield")_ and _[Dark Souls 3](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Target+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Target Shield")_.
