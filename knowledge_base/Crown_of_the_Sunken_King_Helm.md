### Crown of the Sunken King Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Upgraded stats are 100% higher despite the type of titanite used.
  * Grants +1 [Endurance](/Endurance "Dark Souls 2 Endurance"), [Strength](/Strength "Dark Souls 2 Strength"), [Dexterity](/Dexterity "Dark Souls 2 Dexterity"), [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence"), and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"), while reducing [Vigor](/Vigor "Dark Souls 2 Vigor") and [Vitality](/Vitality "Dark Souls 2 Vitality") by -1.
  * [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") in [Memory of the King](/Memory+of+the+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the King") will react with a new set of dialogues to this and the other two crowns.
  * When worn after receiving [Vendrick's Blessing](/Vendrick%27s+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick%27s Blessing"), it will prevent hollowing after death, and completely protect from curse buildup. This effect only works in current playthrough.
