  * **SOTFS** : In the Soldier's Rest area, on the roof where three Old Ironclad Warriors are, there's a corpse close to the edge that has a Whip (Another corpse has a Bastard Sword). The Last Giant must be killed in order to access this area. (Scholar of the First Sin)

  * Lower attack power than the [Bloodied Whip](/Bloodied+Whip "Dark Souls 2 Bloodied Whip") regardless of Dexterity bonus due to the difference in base damage. 
  * Can be aimed vertically to some extent (25 degrees?) when not locked on a target by angling the camera a long way up or down.
