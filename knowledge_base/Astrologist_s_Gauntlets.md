_"Astrologists believe that magical powers can be obtained at moments of special heavenly alignment._   
_Even the collective wisdom of the Melfian Magic Academy cannot pull magic out of the sky, but the ideas of the astrologists led to the creation of new and very useful magic devices."_   
  
  

###  Set Location

  * Sold by [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan") in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep") after fufilling his questline while hollow.
  * Dropped by [Astrologist](/Astrologist "Dark Souls 2 Astrologist") in [Iron Passage](/Iron+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron Passage"). (with the exception of the [hood](/Black+Hollow+Mage+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Hollow Mage Set"))

  
  

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard")
  * **The Moon Hat increases Intelligence by 2.** Rumors:
  * Each set piece is known to increase luck.(Item set says nothing about luck, needs confirmation)
  * Watchdragon parma shield's "luck" might stack with this set.(needs confirmation)
  * Many armor sets do not inquire about other stat increases like being able to increase health(kings crown) or endurance (Velstadts helm) when they certainly do. Luck or "great fortune"(watchdragon parma) might be described as item discovery + chance that the player may deflect a small certain amount of damage percentage.
