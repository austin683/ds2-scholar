**To-do list** for the **Dark Souls 2 Wiki** is a page dedicated to compiling needed changes, additions, updates and revamps to the whole wiki for Dark Souls II.

You can edit this page and add links to pages that you believe need more information, cleanup, or even those that you think should be renamed, redirected or deleted.

## Wiki To-do List

List of missing pages or pages that needs more work and content.  
Miss a page or feature? Then list it in the **Needed Pages** section below.

  * Read the [Editing Guide](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Editing+Guide "Dark Souls 2 Editing Guide") page to learn basics of editing. (currently links to Editing Page DS3 link)

  * ??
  * ??

### Pages needing improvements

  * Boss Souls/Boss Souls weapons link should list better the order, amount of souls required to transform the weapon, as well to identify the boss/location of the soul itself
  * Enemy pages' info/image box needs to have images always have a width of maximum of 300px. To avoid issues like see this for example
  * Fixing the [Merchant](/Merchants "Dark Souls 2 Merchants") and [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") page to add missing characters (which would include better information to some of them even perhaps to their place of origins and tables of contents to sell.
  * Improving the Cosplay Section and to add a link to both the [Fashion Souls](/fashion+souls "Dark Souls 2 fashion souls") and [Cosplay](/Cosplay "Dark Souls 2 Cosplay") (please for the love of youe divinity how do I make two catalogue options to make the text and spaces thinner instead of having them stretch out across the entire page?)

### Tag usage

Wiki tags are not metadata, but a way to define different properties of for example an item. A tag does nothing on its own, but when many pages share the same tag they can be used to list other items with similar properties. Tags should mostly be single words, and not long unique sentences (like "great weapon to pwn n00bs with").   
Example: The [Moonlight Greatsword](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Moonlight+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Moonlight Greatsword"), it's a greatsword, it deals magic damage, and it has a special attack. It should be tagged with something like "Weapon" "Greatsword" "Magic" "Special".

### Cluttered pages

If you encounter a particularly cluttered page, but have no time to clean it up at the moment, then tag the page with " **cleanup** " as a reminder. They will show up below:

### Rename Pages

Pages with names that differ from in-game names should be renamed, so please tag them with " **rename** ". Renaming pages also involves fixing all backlinks and redirecting the current page to the new one. They will show up below:

### Duplicate Pages

Some items/equipment/npc´s have duplicate pages. Please tag such pages with " **duplicate** ", and someone will eventually merge them.

  * [Executioners Chariot](/Executioners+Chariot "Dark Souls 2 Executioners Chariot") (to Executioner's Chariot)
  * [Binding Ring](/Binding+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Binding Ring") (to Ring of Binding)

### Unnecessary Pages

If you encounter an unnecessary page, or have a request to delete a page, then tag it with " **delete** " and it should appear in the list below.

### Redirects that need to be cancelled

### Infusion/Upgrade tables that need to be changed

Not all weapons/shields can be infused or upgraded to the same level. We need to mark those so the tables can be replaced.

\- Bows/Greatbows/Crossbows/Talismans/Chimes/Pyromancy Flames and Staves can't be infused and can be upgraded to +10. Any page with the wrong table should be tagged with: upgrademe

(table to be used)

\- Special weapons/shields that upgrade with Twinking Titanite can't be infused and can be upgraded to +5. Any page with the wrong table should be tagged with: upgradespecial

(table to be used)

\- Boss weapons/shields upgrade with Titanite Scale and can't be infused and can be upgraded to +5. Any page with the wrong table should be tagged with: upgradeboss

(table to be used)
