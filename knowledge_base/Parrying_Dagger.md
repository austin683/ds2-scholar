**Parrying Dagger** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. The **Parrying Dagger** , with a primary focus on [Dexterity](/Dexterity "Dark Souls 2 Dexterity") scaling, is crafted for swift slash and thrust attacks. Its standout feature lies in its parrying capabilities. Additionally, it operates similarly to rapiers, but with a quicker visual animation at the start. Mastering the weapon allows for a unique guard break critical after a successful parry, inflicting even more damage.

> Unlike standard weapons, this dagger is intended for parrying.  
>   
> Accomplishments are forever out of reach to those who constantly fear failure. A true warrior hones his body and mind, and peers far beyond immediate hardship.

### How to get Parrying Dagger in Dark Souls 2

  * From Servants' Quarters bonfire: Turn right after the wooden bridge then instead of the wooden ladder, go left and fall off the roof. Various dogs and Royal Soldiers will be guarding a chest room contaning this weapon.
  * From Exile Holding cells (Requires [Antiquated Key](/Antiquated+Key "Dark Souls 2 Antiquated Key")): Head left from the bonfire and go down the ladder or jump off, there will be a boarded up wall at the bottom. Break the boards, head through and open the locked door. There is a passage way that leads to this weapon, along with the [Bone Staff](/Bone+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Bone Staff") and [Twinblade](/Twinblade "Dark Souls 2 Twinblade").
  * Semi-rare drop from the spiders in lower [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora").

### DS2 Parrying Dagger Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Works similar to Rapiers, however the animation visually begins quicker with this weapon.
  * Very effective if you can master it; after a successful parry, if you hit RB/R1 before the enemy falls to the ground you will execute the guard break critical instead of the riposte critical, inflicting even more damage.
  * This can be done in PvP although it is rather difficult to pull off, so practice is encouraged.
  * Though this weapon can perform a slash when doing a sprinting attack, it is primarily a thrusting weapon.
  * Lightest weapon of the dagger category.
  * See our [Parry](/Parry "Dark Souls 2 Parry") page for more details.
  * Can perform a slash after light attack from this weapons in opposit hand: Parrying Dagger, Bandit's knife, Dagger, Broken sword, Mail Breaker.
  * While being the best off-hand to parry with (can parry multiple enemies / quick hits in conjunction if skillful), it is the quickest, and therefore the hardest to use. Easiest off-hand to parry with is the [Buckler](/Buckler "Dark Souls 2 Buckler").
