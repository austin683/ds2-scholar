**Dragonrider Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
_Armor worn by the dragonriders, King Vendricks royal guard. According to legend, the dragonriders astride not horses, but wyrms. Aspiring dragonriders who had not the mettle to handle their training were torn apart by their wyrms, and those who survived emerged with deific strength._

###  Set Location

  * Sold by [Magerold of Lanafir](/Magerold+of+Lanafir) (36k) in [Iron Keep](/iron+keep#.U0QjQvl_st0) when the 1st bonfire's intensity at 2 (NG+ or [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Bonfire Ascetic")).
  * Must kill [Twin Dragonriders](/DragonRider%28Second+Encounter%29#.U0QkDfl_st0) in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle) to unlock this armor.
