**Velstadt's Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
_"Helmet/Armor/Gauntlets/Leggings worn by the Royal Aegis. Originally imbued with the power of miracles, now soaked with dark after extended exposure in the Undead Crypt._   
_A knight from a faraway land was lured to this accursed land, but forgot even why he came, eventually reduced to a shadow of his former self."_

###  Set Location

  * Sold by [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer) (45,5k) once [Velstadt, The Royal Aegis](/Velstadt%2C+The+Royal+Aegis) is defeated (spend 15k souls at Maughlin's shop to unlock boss armor sets).

  
  
  

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite).
  * Upgraded stats are only 40% higher, not the usual 50%.
  * Helm grants +1 to VIT and END.
  * Helm offers second highest physical defenses (almost equal to those of [Gyrm](/Gyrm+Set) helm, regular [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior+Set) helm and [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon+Set) helm), except for strike defense, and second highest dark defense (almost equal to that of [Executioner](/Executioner+Set) helm and [Shadow](/Shadow+Set) mask).
  * Chestpiece offers third highest dark defense (almost equal to that of [Dark set](/Dark+set) chestpiece) – the highest among medium and heavy armor sets.
  * If worn to the fight, Velstadt's helm will make [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight) furious at once – he'll go straight to second phase with his ultra greatsword buffed. Raime (Fume Knight) used to serve the king alongside Velstadt until their rivalry separated them (see [Rebel's Greatshield](/Rebel's+Greatshield) description), which explains the reaction.
  * Helm's design loosely resembles that of the helm worn by  _Garl Vinland_ in  _Demon's Souls_.
