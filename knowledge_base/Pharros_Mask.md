_"_ A mask depicting Pharros' contraption.  
Tears flow from the eyes of this mask,  
drenching its wearer.

The majority of Pharros' creations  
are perplexing to reasoned men,  
and this mask is no exception._"_

###  Location

  * Found in [Iron Passage](/Iron+Passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron Passage"), on a corpse past [Aged Smelter Demon's](/\(Blue\)+Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 \(Blue\) Smelter Demon") arena.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Upgraded stats are only 50% higher.
  * This mask soaks the user in water permanently until it is taken off, increasing fire resistance by 100 (not counting the regular fire resistance of the mask itself), but decreasing lightning resistance by 100.
  * Also note that wearing the mask darkens your character model and armor; this is the tears of the mask flowing, and drenching its wearer as the description suggests.
  * Extremely handy for walking on paths covered with lava in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep").
  * When worn, this mask hides certain visual effects on the wearer, making effects such as [Iron Flesh](/Iron+Flesh "Dark Souls 2 Iron Flesh") undetectable.
  * The Mask can also be used to wash off poison on the wearer from poison pools or pots.
