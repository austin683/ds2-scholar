**Cleric's Small Shield** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** and Standard Shields can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A small shield used by clerics on pilgrimage.  
Enchanted with a somewhat fragile blessing that allows spells to be deflected by parrying._

     _Specially-crafted to provide extra durability and some level of physical defense."_

### Acquired From:

  * Found in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") near [Cromwell the Pardoner](/Cromwell+the+Pardoner "Dark Souls 2 Cromwell the Pardoner"). 

### 

### Cleric's Small Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Has respectable elemental defenses.
  * Decent lightning damage reduction, but not [100%](/Watcher%27s+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Watcher%27s Shield"), but the spell parrying can compensate for this, highly recommended to infuse with Lightning.
  * Can parry spells, and being fast in terms of parrying speed, making it a good shield for parrying.
