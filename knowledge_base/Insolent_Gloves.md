### Insolent Gloves Description

_"Gloves worn by once-proud clerics._  
_Relics of a party who long ago attempted to conquer the Undead Crypt._  
_For this sin their deaths have been postponed, so they may serve as crypt sentries."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Dropped by [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight) and [Alonne Knight Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain).

### 

### Notes

  * There are only 2 Alonne Captain pieces (the helm and the chest-piece). The Gauntlets and Leggings are from the regular Alonne Knight set.
  * Upgraded with titanite shards.
  * Armor set has very good poise, and good defense for its weight.
  * The chest offers extremely high amount of fire resistance, highest in the game if fully upgraded for any heavy armor.
