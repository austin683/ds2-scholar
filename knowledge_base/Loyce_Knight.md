**Loyce Knight** is a potential ally that can be encountered in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). They appear in the [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King") DLC.

_These Knights of Loyce were devoted guardians of this land that delved valiantly into the depths of chaos, never to return._

_The few that survived remain in Eleum Loyce, now frozen over, awaiting the call of their master._

### Loyce Knight Notes & Tips

  * The player must free them in order to obtain their help with tackling the [Burnt Ivory King](/Burnt+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Burnt Ivory King") by sacrificing themselves and stopping the portals that spawn [Charred Loyce Knight](/Charred+Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Knight") enemies in the area.
  * They will respawn and assist the player until the Burnt Ivory King is defeated.
  * If any Loyce Knights survive after the boss, they will stay in their positions above the portal and will not follow you down again unless you use a Bonfire Ascetic or go through another NG+ cycle.
