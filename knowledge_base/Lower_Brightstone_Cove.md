##  Bonfire Location:

Located in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora).   
Start in the area with the big sand pit and the casting enemies. Take the zip-line turn right and take another zip-line right at a caster. Behind them is a hallway that leads to more enemies and a big hole. Drop down the hole and you are at the bonfire.   
*In Scholar of the First Sin the second zip line has been removed. In order to reach the second bonfire don't take any zip line down or you'll be stuck. Instead at the first zip line kill the mage but don't go down the line. Look to your right below for a ledge and carefully fall down to it. There you'll find the way to the bonfire and a few surprises.
