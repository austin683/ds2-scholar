### DKS2 Burnt Ivory King Strategy

*Strategies are a work in progress. Feel free to edit the page and add yours.   
  
Recommendations   
The "Shield Camper" strategy (works to about NG++ before you need to switch strategy or get a stronger weapon)   
Note that this is a VERY EASY WAY TO BEAT THE BURNT IVORY KING WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT!!!   
Note also that the Charred Loyce Knights drop Loyce Souls, which you need in order to get the Armor of the Ivory King (50 Loyce Souls, then talk to Alsanna)   
1\. Summons (for some reason not found from anywhere else in this page)

  * Twiggy Shei can be summoned for this fight (summon sign is located near the altar in the Grand Cathedral)
  * Lucatiel of Mirrah can be summoned for this fight (summon sign is located near Grand Cathedral bonfire, stairs up and look in the middle)
  * The summons are just healthpools (and occasional staggerers) during the bossfight.
  * It's highly unrecommended to summon NPCs for this BOSS, who has many AoE attacks that means NPCs are unlikely to absorb much damage for you. Altough, as always, NPC summons are useful to distract the boss, giving you time to heal or apply buffs.

  
2\. Loyce Knights (they will help most in this battle!)

  * There are 4 Loyce Knights, one provided by Alsanna, located in the room with the fog door leading to the Old Chaos.
  * 3 Loyce Knights are scattered around Eleum Loyce, you should just explore and you'll find them. (you'll get a ton of cool sh*t while looking for em')
  * Note that NONE OF THE LOYCE KNIGHTS ARE LOCATED IN FRIGID OUTSKIRTS.
  * A brief guide is that each of the **formerly frozen** paths _should_ lead to a knight. They're rather deep within the paths so try to explore thoroughly. There is only one knight in each path. 
  * The Loyce Knights will play an important part in the bossfight. 3 of the knights will seal the portals (that spawn infinite Charred Loyce Knights) and the remaining one (with a nice healthpool) will stay with you to fight the boss.

  
3\. Weapon, shield, and armor. (great importance what you wear)

  * The most important item in this bossfight is the shield (believe it or not) and the shield i used (and the one i suggest) is Havel's Greatshield, infused with Magic. (blocks around 98% of melee and magic, so the Burnt Ivory King's special attacks don't really deal any damage to you. Also very stable)
  * The next most 'important' item (you don't need a weapon, only just the shield. APPLIES ONLY UNTIL NG+) You should pick a weapon that's long and quick, like Washing Pole, or Sir Alonne's Bewitched Sword. Also Avelyn with dark/lightning bolts or dark/lightning magic works perfectly)
  * Any rapier with dark/lightning resin should work just fine. Do bring Repair Powders since it'll be quite a long battle.
  * Armor... Not so much necessary for the boss, but if you're planning to attack, or just have low stamina and cant really block much, use armor like Havel's Set(melee def) or the Chaos Set(magic def)
  * I suggest using Redeye Ring when there's only Charred Loyce Knights (remove the ring when the boss comes, unless you believe in your blocking skills enough)
  * I suggest using Ring of Blades +2 which provides a good addition to your damage output.
  * I also suggest using Chloranthy Ring +2 so you can quickly recover your stamina to block some more.

  
4\. Preparation   
Now you probably wonder what's waiting for you behind the fog door, in the hole down there? It's Old Chaos, and it's full of Charred Loyce Knights, some lava, and 3 portals that spawn those enemies until they're shut.

  * 3 portals that spawn infinite amount of Charred Loyce Knights (if killed enough of them without the portals being shut, the boss will spawn, and you'll be fighting a lot of Charred Loyce Knights among the Burnt Ivory King. If you have 3 or more Loyce Knights, they will eventually (after killing like 5-7 Charred Loyce Knights) go and seal a portal (1 Loyce Knight per portal) (You'll notice they're preparing to seal a portal when their sword flashes in blue and a blue aura surrounds them)
  * The Charred Loyce Knights are either Melee or Magic, the Melee versions using mostly swords and axes, and the Mages using only Pyromancies, mainly just Fireball, Fire Snake, and Combustion.

  
5\. The pre-bossfight   
Now, that you have the Summons behind you, the Loyce Knights polishing their weapons, and your armor, sword, shield and precious jewelry on, and you're gazing at that huge hole behind the fog, and you think, what am I gonna do when I go down there?   
Just follow these instructions and it'll be a piece of cake.

  * Start out by circling the arena when Charred Loyce Knights appear, using the Redeye Ring, the Charred Loyce Knights will focus on you, and leave your summons untouched. Keep on circling and blocking, and watch that stamina! You don't wanna run out of stamina or they'll all gank you. If you get hit, don't heal immediately, as THEY WILL KILL YOU if healing is not timed perfectly. Be patient, block, move, win.

Now, the portals should be closed, or at least 2 of them when a huge portal emerges from end of the Arena, from the middle of two portals. When this happens, you choose whether or not you can tank all of Burnt Ivory King's attacks or not. If not, then unequip the Redeye ring, as the boss will appear if you get close to the big portal.   
6\. The Boss Fight   
You should (hopefully) now have Lucatiel of Mirrah, Twiggy Shei, and one Loyce Knight with full health or almost full health, and all 3 portals sealed.   
If so, damn good job! The boss will be a piece of cake no worries there.   
Get close to the portal, and you'll notice the Burnt Ivory King emerging... You need to make a choice:   
(A) DEFENSIVE POSITION (Harder than offensive position)   
If you chose the defensive position, you'll need to have your Chloranthy Ring +2 and Redeye Ring equipped, along with (preferably) Havel's Greatshield (or gyrm greatshield)  
Start out by blocking, as the boss will charge at you. Now, you don't have to mind about his attacks, just block and dodge when you're running out of stamina, as some of his hits drain quite a lot of stamina, then wait till you have enough stamina, and continue with the blocking.   
The boss will be taken care of by your allies, all you need to do is tank his attacks.   
A few things you should know:

  * He will eventually 'enchant' his weapon with magic, which is very, very easy to notice, as his sword will begin to resemble a lightsaber. Attacks with the 'lightsaber' are very strong, and easily dodgible by rolling backwards. Mostly blocking them is good, just mind the stamina.
  * If he for some reason loses focus and attacks someone other than you, attack him a couple times and he should be all over you again.
  * His 'lightsaber' charge won't last long, maybe a minute, tops, so you don't have to worry about it. He will rebuff, though. (not immediately after losing the charge)

Now, if you followed the instructions, he should be dead. Yay.   
ONE LAST NOTE: Even though the wikipedia tells you that if you kill Alsanna with arrows you'll get the soul, don't do it. You will get the soul, but miss out on so much (you won't get the armor of the Ivory King nor the rest of Loyce Knight items)   
  
  
(B) OFFENSIVE POSITION (the easy choice)   
If you chose the offensive position, you don't really need to worry much... Just enough to know you're playing a game that doesn't quite like you, but not as much as that you're fighting a boss in that game. Stress-free.   
You've now cleared out the Charred Loyce Knights, and the portals are shut. The boss is there, and you need to act.

  * Unequip the Redeye ring. You will be sharing the damage with your teammates.
  * Even though it seems Lucatiel of Mirrah will die (due to her bad healthpool), she probably won't. And if she will, don't worry, as the remaining Loyce Knight has a very nice healthpool, and Twiggy Shei uses Estus Flasks.
  * Twiggy Shei uses a bow, and he is able to stagger the Burnt Ivory King. He will most likely do this more than a couple times during the battle.
  * The Burnt Ivory King, much like most bosses, hate healing, and when you're healing, they will target you.  
Now that you know your team, and what they do, you need to know what to do yourself:

Target lock the Ivory King, with Havel's Greatshield equipped to the offhand, and a long weapon/magic(hexes/miracles)/Avelyn equipped to the right hand.   
The Ivory King uses a series of strong melee attacks, which should be either blocked or dodged.   
If you want this to be easy, you just block, that's all.   
If you want this to be quick, you attack him when he's focused on your teammates. If using a weapon like Murakumo/Washing Pole/Sir Alonne's Bewitched Sword you should throw 2-3 hits at his back after he has performed an attack, and then continue blocking. His attacks are easy to dodge, so if you're low on stamina and for some reason he's attacking you that moment, use that little stamina of yours to perform a dodge when you notice he's performing an attack. The easiest way to dodge his attack is by rolling under either of his arms. Some of his attacks are similar to the Fume Knight's, so it's not really too difficult dodging them.   
If you're not very good at dodging just use blocking.   
The boss isn't really so hard, and your teammates are strong enough to kill him.   
Basically, just try to stay alive there. Blocking is the best method.   
ONE LAST NOTE: Even though the wikipedia tells you that if you kill Alsanna with arrows you'll get the soul, don't do it. You will get the soul, but miss out on so much (you won't get the armor of the Ivory King nor the rest of Loyce Knight items)   
  
  
It's not a flawless strategy, but has worked for me for literally tens of bossruns. The boss may seem difficult due to being the main antagonist of the DLC, but he's pretty much just a slower version of the Lost Sinner, or possibly a weaker Fume Knight. Just remove the fear-factor and you'll see him as a regular scorned guy.  
  
  
  
1\. It is recommended that you find and talk to the 3 [Loyce Knights](/Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Knight") scattered throughout the DLC, one is already waiting for you, to get allies in combat and to close 1-3 portals in the boss area that spawn [Charred Loyce Knight](/Charred+Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Knight") enemies in the area.

  * Alternately you can put this as advantage for farming [Charred Loyce Set](/Charred+Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Set"). (I tried with only one knight and met the boss. After I beat a certain amount of enemies he appeared, but now you don't fight him alone).
  * This can be considered pointless because after you kill the boss you can go in by yourself and fight the loyce knights (no shades or phantoms though) Note: Killing the Burnt Ivory King will significantly reduce the drop rate for loyce souls and the corresponding armor sets. So it is recommended to farm the Loyce Knights before killing the Burnt Ivory King.  
.

2\. Easiest with either full magic immunity + [Gyrm Greatshield](/Gyrm+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Greatshield"), or when using [Havel's Greatshield](/Havel%27s+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Havel%27s Greatshield") imbued with magic, as the Gyrm shield + magic immunity will block elemental damage and also allow to block fire spells from minions. Havel shield will pass through 2,5% of physical dmg but block all magic. You can use armor for more fire resistance in this scenario.   
3\. Charred Loyce Knight at early NGs are vulnerable to Dark [Crypt Blacksword](/Crypt+Blacksword "Dark Souls 2 Crypt Blacksword") +5 buffed with [Dark Weapon](/Dark+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Dark Weapon"), which can dispatch them within 3 two handed strong attack swings.   
4\. Boss seems to be completely resistant to poison. However his minions get poisoned with around 3 toxic clouds, so all 3 poison spells [poison cloud , toxic cloud, dark fog] and poison builds are viable here. _(Boss can be poisoned, he has an extremely high resistance to poison, though. Needed around 15 hits or so with a Poison infused Spotted Whip at 50 ADP. Some more testing maybe?)_   
5\. The boss doesn't seem to aggro on player who is casting healing miracles (offline player can summon both NPCs and focus on healing them during the boss fight)

  * When I was doing it with my friend he always seemed to favor the world host over all else so I believe this needs testing

  
6\. If the Boss is too close to one of the knights while the knight is sacrificing himself to close one of the portals, the ice explosion will instantly kill the boss. With a bit of luck, you can lure him into fighting next to the knight while this happens for an easy instant kill. (No longer works in SotFS)   
7.If your weapons break too fast, consider using Raw or Enchanted [Santier's Spear](/Santier%27s+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Santier%27s Spear") +5. Or have it as backup weapon just in case. Alternately, repeatedly cast [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Great Resonant Soul") while using Loyce Knights and NPC Phantoms as distraction.   
  
**Approaches:**   
  
I used a gyrm greatshield + dark barbed club for killing the charred knights. For the boss I two-handed a lightning ugs, doing around 280-300 per hit. He is not so hard to dodge.

### Dark Souls 2 Burnt Ivory King Hints

  * Ensure you have at least 3 Loyce Knight to seal off the spawning gate, or reunite all four knights to leave one to distract the Burnt Ivory King.
  * Alternately: summon all two NPC phantoms and reunite all four knights.
  * The Loyce Knights only seem to seal the portals when they have sustained enough damage. Therefore, it is wise to let 3 of the knights fight until they seal the portal so that you don't have to deal with extra enemies when the Burnt Ivory King enters the area. _( Definitely not the case. The front left portal always spawns 2 Charred Loyce Knights, the right one spawns 3, and the far left one spawns 4. The Knights won't seal a portal until all the enemies have spawned from it, so the only way to prevent fighting a Charred Knight and the Burnt Ivory King at the same time is to make sure you don't kill them too quickly )_
  * _PC DX11-Version: Both NPC-Signs will appear once you have gathered at least two Loyce Knigths._
  * Gathering all four Loyce Knights and the two NPC phantoms to battle the Charred Loyce Knights repeatedly is a great late-game soul-farming opportunity. Even on Ng8 you don't have to do much work, just stay alive and finish of some strongly wounded enemies, feather out when the Burnt Ivory King appears (_please don't do this when summoning other players, it's annoying)__. On Ng8 with some soul farming equipment this yields >100k souls in <5 min. However, if using bonfire ascetics, keep in mind that the Burnt Ivory King on high Ng cycles is a challenging enemy._

### Burnt Ivory King Trivia in Dark Souls 2

  * The Ivory King is from Forossa[⁽ˣ⁾](/Ivory+King+Ultra+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Ivory King Ultra Greatsword"). It is not specified whether he was born there or just lived there long enough to become an extremely high ranking knight.
  * The Ivory King share some strong similitudes with Gwyn, the Lord of Cinder: Both of them were powerful kings; both of them sacrifices himself in fire; both of them are "corrupted"; both of them are an "End Boss" (While Gwyn was the final boss of Dark Souls 1, The Ivory King seems to be the final boss of the DLCs... Or, at last, those who speak about the crowns!)... Oh! And both of them were followed by their faithful knights... and all of them burned! Plus, their move sets are quite close between each other: The slash combo, the jumping attack, The jump back dodge, the powerful grabbing attack, and the charge attack seems to work the same way.
  * The Ivory King seems to "speak" while you're fighting him. He mumbles "Fire" sometimes when he attacks and at others, he yells out "DIE!!!". You need to have music and voice off as his voice only comes up in the sound effects.
  * The _Old Chaos_ has an almost identical visual appearance when compared with  _Lost Izalith_ in Dark Souls 1, where the Witch of Izalith generated  _The Flame of Chaos._ It is arguably evidential that they are the same location in lore.
