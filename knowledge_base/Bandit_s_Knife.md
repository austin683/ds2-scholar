**Bandit's Knife** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Bandit's Knife** , scaling primarily with [Dexterity](/Dexterity "Dark Souls 2 Dexterity"), is designed for quick slash and thrust attacks. I inflicts additional Bleed damage on your foes. Equip [Shadow Gauntlets](/Shadow+Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Gauntlets") for a 50-point boost to bleed bonus when normal infused, or 60 points for Bleed infusion. The [Crest of Blood](/Crest+of+Blood "Dark Souls 2 Crest of Blood") also contributes to increasing bleed bonus. 

> A knife with a slightly broad single edge. Its tip is shaped to leave a wound that won't easily close. Designed for unsavory work, and beloved by those of unsavory ilk.

###  **Acquired From**

  * Treasure in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse"): Look for a corpse before the [Bridge Approach](/Bridge+Approach "Dark Souls 2 Bridge Approach") bonfire. In the building where Rogues reside, drop down to the level where there's a huge hole in the ground.
  * Drops from [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") enemies using the Bandit's Knife

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Loses fairly little damage when infused with Bleed and still benefits 80% from AR increasing sources like [Ring of Blades](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades").
  * Has the highest critical damage of all daggers, surpassing [Manikin Knife](/Manikin+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Manikin Knife") slightly.
  * Although the bleed build up is less than [Full Moon Sickle](/Full+Moon+Sickle "Dark Souls 2 Full Moon Sickle") and [Channeler's Trident](/Channeler%27s+Trident "Dark Souls 2 Channeler%27s Trident"), these daggers are way easier to land the blow onto humanoid foes, and more durable than the trident.
  * Slightly inferior to [Ashen Warrior Sword](/Ashen+Warrior+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior Sword") in case of bleed buildup, but the speed and stunlock will cover this weakness (in exchange for less reach).
  * Equipping [Shadow Gauntlets](/Shadow+Set "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Set") will increase the bleed bonus by 50 if normal infused and 60 if Bleed infused. 
    * Equipping [Crest of Blood](/Crest+of+Blood "Dark Souls 2 Crest of Blood") also increases bleed bonus. You can even use [Bleeding Serum](/Bleeding+Serum "Dark Souls 2 Bleeding Serum") to push the Bleed build up to full potential.
  * Equipping [Stone Ring](/Stone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Stone Ring") can help you to stagger your foes easier.
  * Despite the Dex requirement, it has no Dex Scaling at all.
