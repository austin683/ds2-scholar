#  Black Dragon Knight (?) (Dragon Knight)

_[Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") >> [<Dragon Shrine>](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine")_   
Strong, agile enemies found in the [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine"). There are three in total, each wielding different weapons. They drop their respective weapons and shield at a very low rate and their [armor](/Black+Dragon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Set") is obtainable from the [Dragon Covenant](/Dragon+Remnants "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Remnants"). If you perform a Dual Bow gesture back to them, they will not attack you for a certain period of time, however, wearing the full Judgments set, they will not attack you (this worked for me, I can not guarantee this will work for you).   
  
**(Scholar of the First Sin)**   
The Black Dragon Knights will not aggro the host but will instead do a duel bow. If the host has a summon, attacks the knights or run away from an enemy, the knights will become hostile. However, after defeating the grey dragon knight at the stairs, the dragon knights will not become hostile unless attacked.   
The knights will not remain hostile through resting at a bonfire.   
  
Possible drops: [Black Dragon Greataxe](/Black+Dragon+Greataxe "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Greataxe"), [Black Dragon Warpick](/Black+Dragon+Warpick "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Warpick"), [Black Dragon Shield](/Black+Dragon+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Shield"), [Black Dragon Sword](/Black+Dragon+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Sword"), [Dragon Scale](/Dragon+Scale "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Scale"), [Awestone](/Awestone "Dark Souls 2 Awestone")   
  
_The legend of the pale dragon is told in various locales, but each account is fragmentary. Very rarely is the black dragon mentioned, and some say that it is merely an embellishment adopted in later retellings of the story._   
_As it is told, the black dragon lost its tail to a brave warrior in a magnificent battle, and the tail was later used to forge several legendary weapons._   
In Scholar of the First Sin these enemies will not become hostile unless you try to pass them without defeating the accompanying Drakeknight(s) or "Champion" on the stairs, or if you have a phantom summoned. Casting [Warmth ](/Warmth "Dark Souls 2 Warmth")near them seems to make them hostile too.
