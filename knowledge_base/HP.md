**HP** or **Health** is the numerical value that determines how much damage can be taken before dying. It is represented on the HUD in the upper left corner, by a red bar directly above your [Stamina](/Stamina "Dark Souls 2 Stamina").

  * [Vigor](/Vigor "Dark Souls 2 Vigor") (VIG) is the primary attribute stat that determines your maximum HP.
  * Maximum HP can also be increased by wearing the [First](/First+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 First Dragon Ring"), [Second](/Second+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Second Dragon Ring"), or [Third Dragon Ring](/Third+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Third Dragon Ring").

    | HP: | 500 | 800 | 1100 | 1300 | 1500 | 1700 | 1750 | 1800 | 1850 | 1900 | 1945 |
    

### HP Consumption

HP is drained by taking damage from any source such as enemies, traps, or falling.

  * The amount of HP drained when attempting to block incoming attacks is determined by your equipment's damage negations. The higher your damage negations, the less HP is drained.
  * [Status Effects](/Status+Effects "Dark Souls 2 Status Effects") are particularly dangerous as they can drain or lessen HP once inflicted. In particular, [Curse](/Curse "Dark Souls 2 Curse"), [Petrification](/Petrification "Dark Souls 2 Petrification"), or [Hollowing](/Hollowing "Dark Souls 2 Hollowing") in general will lower maximum HP down to eventually 50%, or even lower with [Sin](/Sin "Dark Souls 2 Sin") factored in.
  * The [Symbol of Avarice](/Symbol+of+Avarice "Dark Souls 2 Symbol of Avarice") steadily drains HP when worn.
  * The [Chaos Blade](/Chaos+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Blade") drains 50 HP of the user with every successful hit.
  * The [Lost Sinner's Sword](/Lost+Sinner's+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner's Sword") drains 30 HP of the user with every successful hit.

### HP Restoration

The primary way to restore HP is with the [Estus Flask](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask"). See its page for upgrades and details.

  * A [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") can reverse the effects of Hollowing.
