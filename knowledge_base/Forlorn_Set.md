The **Forlorn Set** is an [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") introduced in [Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin](/Dark+Souls+II+Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin") for **Dark Souls 2**.

> Hood/Armor/Gauntlets/Leggings of the Forlorn, who wander the land of the Undead.  
>   
> Born of Aldia's obsession with the First Sin, the Forlorn lost both their corporeal form and a world to call their own. Now they drift into other worlds, ever in search of a home.  
>   
> But without self, one has neither beginning nor end, and so the Forlorn have only to wander.
