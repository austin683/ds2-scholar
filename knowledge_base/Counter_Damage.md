**Counter Damage** in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki") occurs when you hit an opponent while they are in their attack animation or using items. [Riposte](/Riposte "Dark Souls 2 Riposte") and [backstab attacks](/Combat "Dark Souls 2 Combat") do NOT deal counter damage. They deal their own type of additional damage which is not considered counter damage and is not boosted by counter damage boosting items such as the [Old Leo Ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring").

### Dark Souls 2 Counter Damage Guide

Upon landing a counter hit, the weapon damage is multiplied with the Counter Strength modifier of the weapon. For example, a Counter Strength modifier of 120 equals a factor of 1.2. With this in mind, a weapon with a Counter Strength modifier of 100 will, unless it deals [Thrust Damage](/Thrust+Damage "Dark Souls 2 Thrust Damage") ([Old Leo Ring](/Old+Leo+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring")), never actually inflict counter damage (x1.0).

Note: Many weapons have a false Counter Strength modifier shown in their description and certain attacks may have a different Counter Strength modifier applied to them.
