**Yellow Quartz Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A small shield affixed with a yellow quartz._

     _This shield was found in the Iron Keep. Breaks easily due to corrosion, but is light and still very stable._

     _In the Old Iron King's great iron keep was a vast collection of weapons, erected as a display of strength to the world.  
But they were lost when the king's conceit doomed the castle to sink into a lake of fire."_
