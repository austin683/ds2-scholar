    | 7-19 | 6 |

  * Because the increase to Vitality will also increase maximum equip load, wearing this ring can reduce the effectiveness of [Flynn's Ring ](/Flynn%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flynn%27s Ring").
  * For players with under 20 Vigor, Endurance, and Vitality, this ring provides a significantly greater increase to health, stamina and equip load than the **Third Dragon Ring**.
