**Bradley of the Old Guard** is an NPC summon available for multiple boss fights in Scholar of the First Sin.   
In combat, he wields a [Heide Spear](/Heide+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Heide Spear"), [Disc Chime](/Disc+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Disc Chime"), and frequently utilizes offensive [Miracles](/Miracles "Dark Souls 2 Miracles").

###  Notes:

  * He will perform the "Duel Bow" gesture on his arrival and departure.
  * He uses the following miracles: [Lightning Spear](/Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Lightning Spear"), [Heavenly Thunder](/Heavenly+Thunder "Dark Souls 2 Heavenly Thunder"), [Force](/Force "Dark Souls 2 Force"), [Emit Force](/Emit+Force "Dark Souls 2 Emit Force"), and [Sunlight Blade](/Sunlight+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Blade").
  * Has the ability to use [Med Heal](/Med+Heal "Dark Souls 2 Med Heal") to heal himself, as well as the host and other summoned phantoms.
  * If you are not at full health upon summoning him, he will perform the "I Won't Bite" gesture to cue you to approach him so he can heal you
  * It is also worth noting that Bradley wears the [Alva's set](/Alva+Set "Dark Souls 2 Alva Set"), but his defense, especially against fire, is a lot more than the armor would offer. His damage, however, is surprisingly low despite Sunlight Blade.
