### Dark Souls 2 Dragon Eye Usage

  * Place down a summon sign to duel the host of a world, who must summon you in.
  * If you kill the Master of the World you are summoned to you will be given a [Dragon Scale](/Dragon+Scale "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Scale"), should they defeat you after being summoned they will earn a Dragon Scale instead. Use said dragon scales to rank up in the Dragon Remnants.
  * However, if both the Dragon Remnant member and host are killed at the same time (double KO), neither of them would receive a dragon scale, be forewarned.
  * Dragon Remnants do not have to be human to use the eye, and neither does the host have to be human to use the dragon sign. However, the host must not have any Phantom or Dark Spirit nearby.
  * Unlike [Cracked Red Eye Orb](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb"), [Cracked Blue Eye Orb](/Cracked+Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Blue Eye Orb"), and [Red Sign Soapstone](/Red+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 Red Sign Soapstone"), Dragon Remnants spawn right above their summon sign.
  * Cannot be summoned by [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Knight") (needs confirmation)
