### Rupturing Hollow (Undead Citizen) Strategy Tips in DS2

  * Pulling one or two at a time with ranged attacks is often possible. Attack from a distance or as they charge. If they get close enough, the Undead Citizens will often belly flop; all of the flops deal high damage (along with any relevant status effect) and will knock players off their feet. The flop also deals heavy stamina damage if blocked, rendering most low-stability shields ineffective. So, block if have to, but dodging is ideal. They are not particularly durable and may be quickly vanquished by most weaponry. Using ranged weapons is incredibly effective in picking them off one at a time. Using an alluring skull may draw a group to a singular spot allowing players to quickly dispatch them with wide-angled or AoE attacks. Note that they will leap/flop on the alluring skull, so take caution if approaching

### Rupturing Hollow (Undead Citizen) Notes in Dark Souls 2

  * One particular encounter with this enemy occurs immediately after the Ruin Sentinel boss fight. In a thin hallway lined with cells which is used to exit the the boss arena, one of these creatures is located in the far left cell. Albeit risky, it is possible to sprint through. It is also possible to bait it into combusting by moving close to the cell and rolling backwards. An AoE attack may also be used to eliminate it.
