**Hollow Infantry** is an [enemy](/enemies "Dark Souls 2 enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. The **Hollow Infantry** , once low-ranking soldiers in the Kingdom of Drangleic, now exist as hollowed remnants. Formerly basic militia, they wield weaker weapons and equipment compared to Royal Knights. While individually not very threatening, they tend to gather in packs, increasing their danger exponentially. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry Information

_"Clad in rotting versions of the[Infantry Set](/Infantry+Set "Dark Souls 2 Infantry Set"), and found primarily in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"), these hollowed dregs were once the rank-and-file low-ranking soldiers of the Kingdom of Drangleic. Functionally little more than militiamen, they have weaker weapons and equipment than their Royal Knight brethren, but maintain some semblance of their original skills and have a predilection for hunting in packs. Though not very dangerous individually, Hollow Infantry have a notorious tendency to appear in large groups, where their threat level increases exponentially. Dealing with them piecemeal is the best tactic, though weapons with large, sweeping strikes can help deal with them in groups. Beware their attack flurry; though somewhat rare, this attack can do considerable damage and break the guard of the unprepared. They can also perform guard break maneuvers.__"_

### Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry Strategy Tips

  * Rush or bait their attacks and dodge/block and then dispatch. Ranged classes take out from range.

### DS2 Hollow Infantry Movements Set

Depending on the enemy, their movement set and attack types are different:

#### Bandit's Knife Variant:

_Most common variant. Defenseless and rather slow._

  * Chest Stab: The hollow pushes forward with the knife trying to pierce through his objective's chest.  

    * Physical Damage (Thrust)
    * Can be blocked (Cuts enemy attack)
    * Can be parried
  * Diagonal Slash: The hollow charges a slash and throws it downwards, partially losing his stability on the action. 
    * Physical Damage (Slash)
    * Can be blocked (Cuts enemy attack)
    * Can be parried
  * Slashing Barrage: Simillar to Diagonal Slash but slightly faster, the hollow rages and throws a diagonal slash, followed by a second one to the opposite side and 3 more slashes in rapid succession.  
_Dangerous at early game, can deal high ammounts of damage if you get stuck between all the cuts._
    * Physical Damage (Slash)
    * Can be blocked (Cuts enemy attack)
    * Can be parried

#### Sword and Shield Variant:

_Seemingly the most aware variant. Quick attacks and minimal competence._

  * Sword Stab & Slash: The hollow performs Stab and Slash combo with up to 2 stabs and 1 Slash 
    * Physical Damage (Thrust, Slash)
    * Can be blocked (Cuts enemy attack)
    * Can be parried
  * Vertical Sword Slash: The hollow raises his sword above his head and brings it down for a vertical slash. Can also be done as a charge towards the player 
    * Physical Damage (Slash)
    * Can be blocked
    * Can be parried
  * Triple Slash: The hollow will attempt to slash you thrice horizontally, right-left-right.  

    * Physical Damage (Slash)
    * Can be blocked (Cuts enemy attack)
    * Can be parried

#### Infantry Axe Variant:

_Dangerous enemy in early-game. Heavy stuns and surprise attacks._

  * Jumping Slash: The hollow will do a jump towards the player with their axe above their head, doing a vertical attack as they reach the ground.  
_Can catch players off-guard._  

    * Physical Damage (Slash)
    * Can be blocked
  * Vertical Slash: The hollow raises their axe above their head and slowly moves forward, dealing a vertical slash seconds after.  

    * Physical Damage (Slash)
    * Can be blocked (Cuts enemy attack)
    * Can be parried
  * Triple Slash: Similarly to the **Bandit's Knife variant** , the hollow will do a right-left slash with their axe. 
    * Physical Damage (Slash)
    * Can be blocked (Cuts enemy attack)
    * Can be parried

#### Shortbow Variant:

_There's just a few of these, not a big deal._

  * Shot: Just a standard shortbow arrow. Will calculate your movement and shoot ahead of you, so avoid going in straight lines.  

    * Physical Damage (Thrust)
    * Can be blocked

_If you get close to him, he will pull out a Bandit's Knife and act as any other infantry hollow with a Bandit's Knife._

#### Unarmed Variant:

_Annoyingly hostile. They will keep pushing at you untill someone dies._

  * Slap: The hollow will try to hit you with their hand.  

    * Physical Damage (Strike)
    * Can be blocked
    * Can be parried
  * Chest bite: The hollow will attempt to grab you. If succeeded, they will start biting your chest, then drop you on the ground.  
_This attack is very rare and easy to avoid, seems to do almost no damage_
    * Grapple
    * Physical Damage (Thrust)
