**Monastery Charm** is a type of healing consumable in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Monastery Charm** is a sanctified charm that heals poison and replenishes health. These charms were consecrated in reenacted ancient rituals within the [Lindelt](/Lindelt "Dark Souls 2 Lindelt") monastery, recognized today as the modern sanctuary of miracles. [Consumable Items](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") grant various effects such as restorative properties for recovering HP, removing certain negative status effects, applying temporary buffs and debuffs, as well as activating various actions and effects.

> A blessed charm. Cures poison and restores HP.
> 
> Many such charms were blessed in reconstructed ancient ceremonies, carried out in the monastery of Lindelt, now know as the new home of miracles. Though it may lack the power of an original, in circumstances dire enough, an imitation can be quite enough.
