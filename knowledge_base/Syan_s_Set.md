**Syan's Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
_"Replica of the armor of the loyal knight Syan. This solidly-crafted gear offers high defense._   
_Sir Syan was widely known as the Kingdom's most loyal knight, and when the Giants invaded, he volunteered to lead the advance party, but he was slaughtered most dishonorably._   
_The King commissioned replicas of Syan's accoutrements and bestowed them on promising knights, but not long after they donned the armor did most go thoroughly mad."_

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Syan Soldiers](/Syan+Soldier) in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle) and [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt).
  * [Scholar of the First Sin] Non-respawning Syan Soldiers are also found in a number of spots listed below, most of them guarding chests containing [Sublime Bone Dust](/Sublime+Bone+Dust): 
    * next to King's Gate in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants);
    * in the sewers at the exit from [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame);
    * next to Shaded Ruins bonfire and next to King's Gate in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods);
    * at the bottom of [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints);
    * below Undead Lockaway bonfire in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman's+Copse).

  
  

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite).
  * Helm offers second highest fire defense (even a bit higher than that of [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon+Set) helm as of patch 1.02) – the highest among helms upgraded with regular Titanite.
  * Chestpiece offers third highest fire defense (almost equal to that of [Alonne Captain](/Alonne+Captain+Set) set chestpiece) – the highest among medium and heavy armor sets.
  * Gauntlets offer second highest fire defense (almost equal to that of [Chaos](/Chaos+Set) / [Hexer](/Hexer+Set) gloves and [Tattered Cloth](/Tattered+Cloth+Set) manchettes).
  * Leggings offer second highest fire defense (equal to that of [Black](/Black+Set) boots, [Black Dragon](/Black+Dragon+Set) leggings, [Bone King](/Bone+King+Set) and [Saint's](/Saint's+Set) boots and almost equal to that of [Alonne Knight](/Alonne+Knight+Set) leggings).
