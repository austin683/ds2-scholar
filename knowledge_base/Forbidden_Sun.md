**Forbidden Sun** is a [Pyromancy](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Forbidden Sun** , a pyromancy cultivated through Aldian rituals. Unleashes a colossal fireball with an expansive explosion, wreaking havoc over a broad area. [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") are offensive fire spells that do not demand [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith") or [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") prerequisites and can be executed with a [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") or [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame"). The fire damage scales with [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"), yet there are no specific stat requirements for casting pyromancies. However, opponents resistant to fire damage remain unaffected by [Pyromancy Spells](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies").

> What could possibly justify such excessive destructive power? In all likelihood, the madmen of Aldia never even questioned the need."

### Dark Souls 2 Forbidden Sun Acquired From

  * [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan")  
You must speak to him **_while he is trapped behind the barrier and while you are hollowed_**. Anything else will result in him telling you to leave him alone.  
Burning a Bonfire Ascetic will not reset Royal sorcerer Navlaan's state if you talk to him under incorrect conditions.  
To get Forbidden Sun, you must accept the assassination mission to kill [Felkin the Outcast](/Felkin+the+outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the outcast") and obtain his [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff").  
However _,_ you do not need to kill Felkin. Instead, if you talk to Felkin with 20 Faith and 20 Intelligence, he will give you the  
[Hexer Set](/Hexer+Set "Dark Souls 2 Hexer Set") and a [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff"). So long as the staff is in your inventory, Navlaan will think you killed Felkin, and he will give you the spell.  
Alternatively, you can get the staff from the mimic that is to the left of the first bonfire in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep").  
Note: The mimic does not drop the staff in Scholar of the First Sin.

### Forbidden Sun Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * At 42 ATN or lower, you only get one cast. At 43 ATN a second cast is added, and a third is added at 94 ATN.  
If you pull the lever you will NOT get this from Royal Sorcerer Navlaan.
  * Damage can be increased with [Penal Handcuffs](/Penal+Handcuffs "Dark Souls 2 Penal Handcuffs").
  * This spell has one of the best cast-time-to-damage ratios. This makes it perfect for punishing people attempting to heal mid-fight in PvP.
  * Tip: It's recommended to wear the Hexer's Hood (better than Saint's as pyro scales with int and faith, but Saint's only boosts faith) so you have 3 casts without needing 94 ATN.
