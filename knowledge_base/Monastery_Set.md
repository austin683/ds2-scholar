**Monastery Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
  
  
_"A traditional sacred headcloth/longshirt/gloves/skirt crafted at Lindelt Monastery. Made of lightweight, flowing white fabric._   
  
_The ceremonial design suggests that they revered whatever it was they watched over._   
_The purity of the garment, however, neatly symbolizes the fraudulence found at the very heart of the monastery."_

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by dark spirit [Painting Guardian](/Painting+Guardian+Phantom "Painting Guardian") in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia's+Keep "Aldia's Keep") on NG+ (along with [Monastery Scimitar](/Monastery+Scimitar "Monastery Scimitar")). Note: this dark spirit does not respawn, drops are not guaranteed and do repeat.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite).
  * Hood offers second highest poison resistance (almost equal to that of [Gyrm](/Gyrm+Set) helm).
  * Robe, gloves and boots offer the highest poison resistance.
  * Boots offer third highest bleed resistance (almost equal to that of [Manikin](/Manikin+Set) boots).
  * Hood, robe and gloves have the highest physical defense to weight ratio (but defense itself is low).
  * It is the armor set of _Painting Guardians_ from _Dark Souls_.
