###   
DS2 Black Dragon Greataxe Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded to +5 with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone").
  * As with other dragon weapons, the Black Dragon Greataxe boasts high base damage, but no scaling (unless infused with Enchanted path which it will scale a D in magic bns.)
  * Uses [Lion Greataxe](/Lion+Greataxe "Dark Souls 2 Lion Greataxe") moveset. When used in a Powerstance with any heavy weapon other than another Greataxe it will use the Lion Greataxe Powerstance moveset.
  * Extremely devastating under +5 Raw path combined with Ring of Blade, it only weighs half as much as a [Gyrm Greataxe](/Gyrm+Greataxe "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Greataxe") and both deal similiar damage.
