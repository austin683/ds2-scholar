**Great Lightning Spear** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle.

> "A miracle that launches a great spear of lightning.  
> Said to be the legacy of an ancient clan whose leader was revered as the God of Sun.  
>   
> The name of the clan has been lost to time, but the gross incandescence of our magnificent father shall never wane."

### Acquired From

  * Buy from [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis") for 13,000 souls after obtaining the King’s Ring. 
  * [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"). From the draw bridge shortcut lever, go through the tunnel on the same side, In the first room open the illusionary wall, Use a Pharros Lockstone, break the glowing wall on the opposite side and it is in the chest.
  * Down the Pit in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). Pay [Laddersmith Gilligan](/Laddersmith+Gilligan "Dark Souls 2 Laddersmith Gilligan") 12,000 souls to set up the ladder. Descend the ladder until you are on a platform then climb up the smaller ladder. Open the door by using the [Forgotten Key](/Forgotten+Key "Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Key") and it is in the far right chest.

### Notes

  * The hurled bolt of lightning is considerably faster cast than its Dark Souls counterpart, and more powerful than [Lightning Spear](/Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Lightning Spear").  
This spell has a small AoE that will affect the original target and enemies that stand close to the original target. The AoE does 18% of the damage of the original spear and still does a small amount of poise break.  
If the enemy is in a river or any body of water, it will conduct a small AoE that will also affect enemies within the blast radius.
  * Before 1.08 Calibration it had a fixed 11 spell uses. It has now greatly dropped to 2, making it inferior to [Sunlight Spear.](/Sunlight+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Spear")
