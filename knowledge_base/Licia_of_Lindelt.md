### Licia of Lindelt Dialogue

**\- First Encounter**  
Are you from these parts?  
My name is Licia.  
I have come to spread the art of miracles, a practice of which I am a disciple.  
I can see that you are well suited to comprehend their wondrous power.  
But the cost of it? That's for your heart to decide.

**\- Meeting again (Tower of Flame)**  
Just speak up if you're in need of miracles.  
That's why I'm here, after all.

**\- Meeting again (Rotunda)**  
Oh, hello there… An honour to see you again.  
This room is not as it seems. There are two, not one, pathways leading out.  
And only this lovely thing reveals the other path.  
And this, you lovely thing… Only runs on miracles!  
Shall I provide you with one?

**\- Using Talk Option (Tower of Flame)**  
I'd heard awful rumours about this place, and I'm afraid they were all true.  
The king, gone. The earth, ravaged. The burden on the people weighs heavy.  
I fear that by now, they may have scarce room in their hearts for miracles…

**\- Using Talk Option (Tower of Flame)**  
Why did I come here? Well…  
Do I need any other reason, than to spread the gospel of miracles?  
My preceptor always said this art should be shared with the world.  
And such is my only wish.

**\- Using Talk Option (Tower of Flame)**  
Sometimes I fight the urge to pack up and go back home.  
It is, well…I must do this.  
And being out here all alone only makes this a more fitting test of my fortitude.

**\- Using Talk Option (Tower of Flame)**  
I expected this cathedral to be bustling, but there's hardly a soul to be found here.  
Without any goings-on, I'll have to move soon.  
To a place I could gull the…  
Sorry, help the gullible by teaching the good word…Hah hah…

**\- Using Talk Option (Rotunda)**  
To cast miracles, you must have strong faith in the gods.  
Miracles began as tales told by gods.  
We preserve their will with lore, pray to their greatness, and are blessed in return.  
You must nourish your faith.

**\- Using Talk Option (Rotunda)**  
Miracles have been passed down through us since the First Flame.  
Isn't it extraordinary to think they've existed since the very origins of the world?  
And now, you can have this power for yourself. Don't miss out on the road to enlightenment!

**\- Using Talk Option (Rotunda)**  
What is the First Flame?  
Well, it's…  
Hmm, you're not ready to comprehend it, I'm afraid!  
You require more faith! And more miracles. Many more miracles!

**\- Moving Path**  
Go ahead, then.

**\- After defeating four old ones**  
You've had quite a journey, I can see…  
You must have a glorious number of souls by now…  
What a wonderful feeling that must be…Heh heh…

**\- When invading**  
Curses…Puzzled me out, have you?  
At least now I can finish you off, guilt-free! Hah hah!

**\- When gifting the player with items**  
You deserve to have these. For your faith has truly deepened.  
Go on, and seek greater miracles. With your faith, you deserve no less!

**\- Leaving after using her services**  
May the power of miracles be with you.  
Offer your souls to the gods.

**\- Leaving without using her services**  
No need for miracles?  
The gods frown upon such soul scrimpers!

**\- Leaving without exiting menu**  
Oh? Done so soon?

**\- When attacking**  
Please, stop this!  
Hyahh! I've no choice, now! (aggro'd)

**\- When killing (non-invasion)**  
Have faith…

### Licia of Lindelt Strategy in Dark Souls 2

If you possess the [Crushed Eye Orb](/Crushed+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Crushed Eye Orb"), you will receive a message when you next meet her. Activating the orb allows you to invade her as a Red Phantom within the rotunda. While she is not a pushover, she is susceptible to several consistent strategies.

##### General Combat Tactics:

  * Use the central pillar to block her lightning miracles and break line-of-sight during the encounter.
  * Block her [Wrath of the Gods](/Wrath+of+the+Gods "Dark Souls 2 Wrath of the Gods") (WotG) and chime physical attacks effectively using [Magic Shield](/Magic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Magic Shield").
  * Negate all damage from her lightning miracles using a Lightning [Watcher's Shield](/Watcher's+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Watcher's Shield"), Lightning [Mastodon Greatshield](/Mastodon+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Mastodon Greatshield"), or [Havel's Greatshield](/Havel's+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Havel's Greatshield").
  * Interrupt her miracle casting by exploiting her low poise with constant attacks to stagger her.
  * Inflict Poison to drain approximately 1000 HP per application, which is highly effective against her high health pool of roughly 8,000 to 9,000 HP.
  * Equip the [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring") to slow weapon degradation if your damage output is low, as the fight can become a war of attrition.
  * Interrupt or backstab her immediately when she begins casting healing miracles at 50% health to prevent the battle from resetting.
  * Be aware that killing her via invasion adds one point of [Sin](/Sin "Dark Souls 2 Sin"), which can eventually trigger "Sinner" status.

##### 

##### Recommended Methods:

  * Repeatedly use a ground-pounding weapon like the [Large Club](/Large+Club "Dark Souls 2 Large Club") to flatten her and prevent any counterattacks or healing.
  * Mash light attacks with a Poison [Caestus](/Caestus "Dark Souls 2 Caestus") to keep her perpetually interrupted; equip the Chloranthy Ring to maintain the stamina required for this.
  * Walk her up the stairs and off the cliff next to the [Company of Champions](/Company+of+Champions "Dark Souls 2 Company of Champions") in Majula using the poking attack of a [Parrying Dagger](/Parrying+Dagger "Dark Souls 2 Parrying Dagger") to interrupt her.
  * Silence her miracles entirely using the hex [Profound Still](/Profound+Still "Dark Souls 2 Profound Still"), forcing her to rely on her chime for substantial but predictable physical damage.

##### 

##### Caster/Hybrid Strategy:

  * Equip casting speed boosting gear such as the [Black Hood](/Black+Hood "Dark Souls 2 Black Hood") and the Lion Mage Set (Robe, Cuffs, and Skirt).
  * Use the [Clear Bluestone Ring](/Clear+Bluestone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Clear Bluestone Ring"), [Lingering Dragoncrest Ring](/Lingering+Dragoncrest+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Lingering Dragoncrest Ring"), and [Chloranthy Ring](/Chloranthy+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Chloranthy Ring") to optimize spell casting and stamina recovery.
  * Whittle her health down to 50% using [Great Heavy Soul Arrow](/Great+Heavy+Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Great Heavy Soul Arrow") while keeping your distance.
  * Defend against [Wrath of the Gods](/Wrath+of+the+Gods "Dark Souls 2 Wrath of the Gods") at mid-range by using the [King's Mirror](/King's+Mirror "Dark Souls 2 King's Mirror") shield.
  * Switch to a Bleed or Poison weapon once she is at half health and strike her relentlessly to prevent her from healing.

### Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindelt Tips

  * Exercise caution if engaging her early in the game; her high health pool and powerful miracles can easily overwhelm new characters.
  * Exploit her AI by using fast weapons to maintain a consistent stun-lock, as she lacks poise and relies entirely on casting.
  * Cast the hex [Profound Still ](/Profound+Still+ "Dark Souls 2 Profound Still ") when playing as a caster to disable her ability to use miracles, significantly reducing the fight's difficulty.
  * Restore her services by praying at her tombstone and paying 7,000 souls if she has been killed; she will reappear as a ghost to sell items and miracles.
  * Ensure she has moved to Majula to count toward the Gathering of Exiles achievement before initiating combat if you are pursuing trophies.
  * Locate a[ Cleric's Sacred Chime](/Cleric%27s+Sacred+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Cleric%27s Sacred Chime") on the cliffs in Majula as a free alternative to purchasing one from her.
  * Retrieve the [Rotunda Lockstone](/Rotunda+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Rotunda Lockstone") from the ground at her original location if you choose to kill her via long-range attacks at Heide's Tower of Flame.
  * Force her off the tower ledge at Heide's Tower of Flame for an easy kill, then rest at a bonfire to make her loot appear.
  * Collect her loot immediately after an environmental kill; exiting the game before doing so may cause the items to disappear, potentially locking the player out of [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman's+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman's Copse").
  * Acquire her unique spells for achievement progress before using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") in Majula, as world resets can interfere with NPC questlines.
