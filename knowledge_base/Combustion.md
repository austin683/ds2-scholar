**Combustion** is a [Pyromancy](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Combustion** , a basic spell for budding pyromancers. Ignites a flame in front of the caster. Though elementary, its simplicity proves surprisingly effective. [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") are offensive fire spells that do not demand [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith") or [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") prerequisites and can be executed with a [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") or [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame"). The fire damage scales with [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"), yet there are no specific stat requirements for casting pyromancies. However, opponents resistant to fire damage remain unaffected by [Pyromancy Spells](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies").

### Combustion Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * This spell can be farmed easily by burning a Bonfire Ascetic ِat the Undead Lockaway bonfire (the cell where Creighton is locked away). If enough copies of Combustion are acquired, along with the use of the Hexer's hood, you can completely remove the need to use a melee weapon in combat as combustion could easily replace it.
