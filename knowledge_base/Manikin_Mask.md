**Manikin Mask** is a [Helm](/Helms) in **Dark Souls 2**.

_"Mask of the Manikins of Harvest Valley. A fickle queen gave them life, and tore off their faces. How else could she forgive those who dared gaze upon her?"_

### Location

  * Drop from Manikin in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak)

### Notes

  * Part of the [Manikin Set](/Manikin+Set). 
    * Very high physical defense/weight ratio, so very good choice for a lightweight piece of armor if you cannot take on much more weight.
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Ores).
  * You can download a mod for the game (on nexusmods) and edit the texture to the same, as it was in the trailer of DarkSoulsII.
  * Download: (As every texture mod, it requires )
