### Heide Knight Gauntlets Description

_"Gauntlet worn by Heide Knights"_  
_"Whether Heide refers to a kingdom or was just a name for the land is not clear, for no records date back far enough to tell._  
_All that is known is that the Way of Blue has its origins in Heide, and that Heide was later subsumed by the sea."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Rare dropped by [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight) NG+(only) (or by Bonfire Ascetic)

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite Shards, Large Titanite Shards, Titanite Chunks, Titanite Slab](/Ores)
  * Best way to get the set is to kill the knight that is in [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille). (Exile Holding Cell bonfire. Short walk to the knight from the bonfire, with only one enemy in the way.) Using a greathammer will make this simple, as your heavy attack will stunlock the red phantom and the [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight).
  * Assuming that you're attempting to get the entire set via bonfire ascetic, you will need more than one, as the armor does not drop all together, but only in pieces
