**Cursebite Ring** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). The **Cursebite Ring** , part of the peculiarly designed "bite" ring series, boosts curse resistance. The shared, unsettling design of these rings indicates a common origin. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> One of several "bite" rings, known for their peculiar design. Increases curse resistance. The similar, oddly disturbing design of these rings suggests a common source. Whoever the master craftsman was, he clearly knew his trade.

### DS2 Cursebite Ring Tips and Notes

  * The resistance provided by the Cursebite Ring could prove useful against Nashandra, who summons a number of wisps that constantly plague the player with curse if they get too close. Players should be mindful where the wisps are when strafing or dodging. The ring should be very helpful but in the worst case scenario, pair it alongside the Ring of Binding to limit HP reduction.
