### Blacskmith Lenigrast Dialogue

**\- When first met outside his shop**

  1. Who are you?  
Oh, it doesn't matter, just help me open this door.  
I packed my tools in here, seeing it was vacant…  
but now somebody's gone and locked the door.
  2. I'm a blacksmith. I'm nothing without my tools.  
Bring me that key. Chop chop!

**\- When talking to him outside the shop, after opening the shop**  
Ah, yes, very good.  
Now I can get to work.  
But first, let me set up. Come again later.

**\- When first met inside his shop having met him outside**  
You, stand back. This is dangerous work.  
Oh, you're that traveller. The name's Lenigrast.  
I appreciate your help, but… I don't like travellers one bit.  
A man ought to labour with his feet planted firmly in the earth.  
Not roam around like you flirtatious vagabonds.  
Oh, what does it matter… Go on, show me what you've got.  
Your equipment. Let me have a look. But do it quick.

**\- When first met inside his shop without having met him outside**  
You, stand back. This is dangerous work.  
The name's Lenigrast. Just a simple blacksmith.  
And you are…hmph! Another useless traveller.  
A man ought to labour with his feet planted firmly in the earth.  
Not roam around like you flirtatious vagabonds.  
Oh, what does it matter… Go on, show me what you've got.  
Your equipment. Let me have a look. But do it quick.

**\- When talking to him to open the interaction menu**  
What? You again?  
(or)  
You again? Can't you see that I'm busy?  
(or)  
Hmph, I'd given you up for dead. Almost had me worried, really…  
(or)  
I knew you'd be around soon. Go on, show me what you've got.

**\- When leaving, having used his services**  
I'll be around, if you make it back.

**\- When leaving, without having used his services**  
Hmph. Don't waste my time.

**\- When walking off without closing the menu**  
People these days…

**\- Using 'Talk' option**

  1. Drat, you're worse than my reckless daughter.  
Don't spend your whole life in transit, you hear?
  2. You'll need souls to repair and improve equipment.  
I know only of smithing, but souls have many other uses, as well.  
Don't waste your souls on useless trinkets. Think before you spend.
  3. Equipment can be strengthened with rare orestone. But such orestone won't come easily.  
My girl knows her stones, but she's always out prancing about.  
Now, there's a time for travels, but you can't wander the world forever.  
Even you must have someone waiting back home…

**\- Using 'Talk' option with the Dull Ember in the inventory**  
I see that you have an ember. Where did you get it?  
I hear that embers were once used in a special process to fortify weapons.  
But the whole art was lost long ago. Blacksmiths can't use embers any more.  
Including myself, I'm afraid. Just keep it as a souvenir.

**\- Using 'Talk' option after Chloanne comes to Majula**

  1. My witless daughter finally came home.  
Just as oblivious as she's always been.  
Well, at least now I can keep an eye on her.
  2. Stones? Try asking my daughter.  
You might be surprised.

**\- Using 'Talk' option after Giligan comes to Majula**

  1. Now, don't go near that scum near the pit.  
The scoundrel's name is Gilligan, and he's infamous in our home town.  
Yes, everyone's heard of him, as he always manages to stir up trouble.
  2. Gilligan can certainly be helpful at times, but he's a real conniver when it comes to money.  
Hah, there are even people out for his life.  
And you can bet he brought it on himself.

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
How goes your journey?  
Take these. They should help a bit.

**\- When attacked but not aggroed**  
Now…! Watch it!  
(or)  
What's that about?!

**\- When attacked and aggroed**  
Well, if that's what you want!

**\- When killing the player**  
Hmph, the damned fool…

**\- When re-encountered after aggroing**  
You should have stayed far away!

**\- When attacked and health is under 50%**  
The gall of it!

**\- When killed**  
(death scream; no subtitle)

**\- Unknown**  
Chloanne…I…

### Dark Souls 2 Blacksmith Lenigrast Notes & Trivia

  * If you speak to him after Chloanne has moved to Majula, he mentions that she is his daughter. Speaking to Chloanne, she will tell the player that Lenigrast looks like her father, and asks if he's "one of those hollows." Given Chloanne's confused state and Lenigrast's relative lucidity, it can be assumed that Lenigrast is her actual father, and Chloanne does not recognize Lenigrast due to her father's hollow appearance.
