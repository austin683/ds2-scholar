**Lion Warrior Skirt** is a **Legging** and a part of [Lion Warrior Set](/Lion+Warrior+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lion Warrior Set") in **Dark Souls** 2.

_A skirt worn by Lion Clan warriors._  
_The Lion Clan are an offshoot race that have no ties to humans, and would murder anyone with the curious notion of approaching them._  
_The lion clansmen seem to despise their own looks, as they hate being seen._

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Cape, cuffs and skirt are dropped by [Lion Warriors](/Lion+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Warrior") in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") (only found next to Shaded Ruins bonfire).
  * Helm and alternative chestpiece – [Red Lion Warrior Cape](/Red+Lion+Warrior+Cape "Dark Souls 2 Red Lion Warrior Cape") – are dropped by Golden-maned Lion Warrior found below the arena with [Manscorpion Tark](/Manscorpion+Tark "Dark Souls 2 Manscorpion Tark"). That lion spawns only once and both items are rare drops. 
    * [Scholar of the First Sin] That lion is moved to ruins straight on the path from bonfire.

### Lion Warrior Skirt Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Cuffs offer the highest curse resistance.
  * Skirt offers third highest curse resistance.
  * All pieces of the set reduce falling damage (the effect is weaker compared to [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring")). All pieces stack with each other and with other items having that effect.
