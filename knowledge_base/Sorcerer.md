### Sorcerer Class Build for Dark Souls 2

The build that is listed below is a set of equipment and recommended stats that we see fit for the Sorcerer Class in Dark Souls 2. For more builds, check out our [PvE Builds](/PvE+Builds "Dark Souls 2 PvE Builds") and [PvP Builds](/PvP+Builds "Dark Souls 2 PvP Builds") pages to find various builds that have been created by the Fextralife team and its community.

_**Moonlight Battlemage**_

  * This is one of the good **Sorcerer** builds that you can find in the [PVE Builds](/PVE+Builds "Dark Souls 2 PVE Builds") page made by "IgnusKnavery". 
  * This build focuses on both spells and melee. Although it centers around the Moonlight Greatsword, there are several other weapons you have at your disposal with those stats. However, even with the nerfed MLGS, it dishes out tons of damage and shouldn't be overlooked. You're killing two birds with one stone because your INT stat is what the MLGS scales from, and you can utilize the most powerful sorcery spells of the game. Crank up your attunement to 30, and you have six slots to utilize. I also take advantage of the pyromancy flame +10. This is awesome if you want to do a little PvPing. These is a great build for those that dislike being a glass cannon and would like the option of getting down and dirty, or sitting in the background and lobbing spells.

### Notes and Tips About Sorcerer

A class that is almost entirely focused on ranged attacks early on due to their low physical stats (probably meant for dexterity weapons). The most important thing to note, their spells are based on a regenerating ammo system. Each spell has a certain number of charges i.e. ammo on how many times it can be used before it runs out, and this ammo gets fully regenerated if you rest at a bonfire. However, also keep in mind that resting at a bonfire resurrects all of the enemies on the map so you'll have to balance your spell use with some weapon use to make it between bonfires. Your initial Soul Arrow spell starts with 30 charges. You CAN equip the same spell multiple times in multiple Attunement slots; it will increase the charge capacity of the spell without having to switch the spell selection. It does not take much to increase your Attunement enough to get another slot and get another Soul Arrow scroll for 1500 souls, and it is greatly recommended to do this in order to VASTLY improve the combat endurance of this class.

They are the archetypal mage, with better dodging abilities than defense. They can be a difficult class for new players due to their extremely low strength, leaving them unable to use any shield effectively, but the dagger has great critical damage at the start. This leaves them vulnerable at close range, however, once you focused on leveling up Endurance, Attunment and Intelligence, their magic and pyromancy can be very devastating, since pyromancy now scales with intelligence, decent on some bosses, vulnerable to melee at early level, however, they also start with daggers, combined with the one found in the beginning, you now have two daggers, you may raise your dexterity to 10 in order to perform power stance, and they receive good scaling with early weapon [Fire Longsword](/Longsword "Dark Souls 2 Longsword")(requires 10 Strength and 9 Dexterity), however, their low Faith makes them extremely difficult on learning miracle and hex, or vise versa in case of Cleric, which is trivial. This is considered to be a strong late-game class, weak from the beginning, devastating at the later.

With very powerful spell shots and long range, this class can be surprisingly effective against very tough enemies, if positioned right. One example, at the very beginning of the game, a hidden path to the left of the witches hut where you can choose your class has a large Ogre, which can easily kill a melee character in one attack in a variety of ways. However, with a Sorcerer, fire at it then back off, having it chase you as you go, and get through the small hidden archway you first went through. The troll will not be able to get through but you can fire away at your leisure and kill it with charges to spare. Keep an eye out for other critical positions like this where you can fire on an enemy and they can't get to you to fight back, and you'll be able to take on some tough enemies at an astoundingly lower level than you should be able to.

One additional early tip that PROFOUNDLY helps the build: in Majula, from the bonfire start going down the lower path (if you're looking at the water from the bonfire, go right along the edge of the cliff). The low section of wall on the left can be jumped on at the slanting break of it; do this and carefully follow it, and you will find a corpse with a set of Binoculars, and further for a Morningstar and Cleric Charm. The Binoculars are an interesting piece; equip it in your offhand like a second weapon, and if you click and hold that attack button you look through the binoculars. YOU CAN STILL FIRE SPELLS WHILE HOLDING THIS VIEW. This can allow for precise long-range sniping, the spell will fire into the exact center of your view if you Hold the attack for the spell shot, not just a quick tap. This can single handedly make many somewhat challenging lower level enemies almost trivial if you can find them and shoot them first before they have any chance to fight back. One particular trick to consider is to use the Binoculars on any laying down/sitting body. If you see any kind of movement like they're breathing, they're going to ambush you. Shoot them first.

For a bit of added tactical flexibility, once you gain a third Attunement slot for spells (and you should try to do this before attempting Heide's Tower of Flame) you should get the STR and DEX needed to equip a Shortbow, which will let you snipe certain key targets from farther away than your spells can reach, such as the Heide Dragon from the stairs. To snipe with the bow select it, tap the attack button to nock an arrow then click and hold the offhand button to go into a zoomed sniping view like you do with the Binoculars and a staff for spells. This will also be enough stats to properly equip a Rapier, a good fast weapon for close range combat in narrow corridors and significantly more effective than your initial Dagger, and a good choice for being in your offhand alongside your Binoculars, allowing you to rapidly switch between melee and spell combat when need be. Eventually you'll replace both the bow and rapier, but during your initial levels with a Sorcerer you should find they work very, very well.

It is also EXTREMELY recommended to get Pyromancy as soon as possible; the Pyromancy spells offer a rather different and very wide spread of tactical options for combat, as well as simple exploration since even the basic Fireball spell can detonate oil barrels. Quite a number of hidden passageways can be opened from detonating nearby oil barrels, and a chain reaction of oil barrel explosions will do massive damage to any nearby enemies.

If you are worried about your ammo endurance between bonfires or on a hit-and-return run to a Boss, also remember about Exhausting an area; after roughly 12 rounds of killing enemies in an area and resting at the corresponding bonfire to respawn them the enemies will no longer show up for the rest of that game run. So you can slowly but systematically break down the defences of any area, allowing you to push further with less spell and health potion use. But also remember that this means you can exhaust your income sources especially if you die with a large Soul stockpile, then die again before getting to your bloodstain that is holding them so that entire stockpile will be lost. Don't take foolish risks in areas like this, and don't spend your Souls on items in the shops you won't use.  
  
Oddly, they possess the Black Hollow Mage Robe, which is considered to be a rare armor piece, all they need is to find the [missing hood](/Hollow+Mage+%28Black%29 "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Mage %28Black%29"). The Sorcerer's Staff is also nothing to be sneezed at; it isn't the best staff in the game but it is the best staff you'll have access to for quite a massive chunk of it, so don't hesitate to reinforce it with Titanite every chance you get to make your spells as strong as possible as early as possible. If you like lighter armors to keep good movement the Black Hollow Mage Robe is a very effective piece as well, giving respectable boosts to EVERY defense except Poise for a rather trivial weight, so feel free to upgrade it heavily as well. 

In PvP, a Sorcerer/Pyromancer hybrid character in the hands of a skilled player is one of the most unpredictable opponents you will ever face. While with non-magical fighters someone can take one look at your character and get a rough idea of how you can fight and move given the kind of armor, weapon and/or shield you're holding, even if you can tell that someone is holding a staff or pyromancy flame you'll have no idea what kind of spells they're equipped with until they start shooting you with them. From long range homing bolts, to wide-area shotgun blasts, to powerful stationary explosive mines, to acid clouds that shatter your armor, always be on your guard when you try to take on a seasoned magic user.
