### Crystal Magic Weapon Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Buffs weapon with magic damage. Duration scales with Intelligence: 63 sec. at 28 Int and up to 99 sec. at 42 Int. Superior to [Magic Weapon](/Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Magic Weapon") and [Great Magic Weapon](/Great+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Great Magic Weapon"). Equivalent to [Sunlight Blade](/Sunlight+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Blade") and [Dark Weapon](/Dark+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Dark Weapon") in effectiveness.
  * DS2's buff formula differs from other Souls games, instead relying primarily on the targeted weapon's base damage to determine how much AR the spell buff will add. Matching the spell buff with a damage type present on a weapon will add a flat bonus to the total AR, depending on whatever the weapon is infused with and/or naturally inflicts said damage type. A small scaling bonus is also added unless the targeted weapon doesn't scale at all with any stats.
