### How to get Great Club in DS2

  * Found in a chest in the lower area of [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"): After the second bonfire, head down to the bottom of the gutter, once you hit dirt before going to the black gulch, there is a ladder to climb up that leads you to the chest with the Great Club inside.

### Dark Souls 2 Great Club Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * At Normal +10 with 50 Strength this weapon has an Attack Rating of 567 (420+147), which is better than the [Large Club](/Large+Club "Dark Souls 2 Large Club") at same stats (has 546 AR).
  * The Large Club and Great Club, both at 70 durability, have their durability go down really fast. Probably better suited for bosses or used with the [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring").
  * Despite its massive size and weight this weapon and similar weapons in the class actually have amazing directional control which can be used to catch opponents approach from your rear completely off guard. To do so, you must be un-locked and initiate the attack in the opposite direction you want it to land - as soon as the attack begins, move the directional pad (or mouse) to the opposite side of the character.
  * Can be power stanced with the Large Club
