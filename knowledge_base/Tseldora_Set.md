**Tseldora Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Equipping entire armor sets often does not provide specific benefits (though specific pieces may provide augments), so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").  
  
  
  
_"Outfit worn by settlers of Tseldora. Rather fancy but with low defence and unfit for battle._   
_Its design recalls Tseldora's glory days, the peak of the brightstone boom."_   
  
_Scholar of the First Sin changed to:_   
_"[Armor piece] worn by settlers of Tseldora. Rather fancy but with low defense and unfit for battle."_   
_Cap: "Tseldora flourished with the discovery of brightstone, deep under the settlement. But with this prosperity came greed in equal measure, and the people were ever in search of that which they lacked."_   
_Rest: "The brightstone that brought prosperity to Tseldora served only to stoke the flames of its peoples' desires, eventually leading to its ruin. Those bewitching, brilliantly gleaming stones are said to be fragments of a being that once roamed the entrails of the earth."_  
  
  

### Set Location

  * Dropped by [Spider Drones](/Spider+Drone "Dark Souls 2 Spider Drone") in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora").
  * Very rare drop from [Parasite Spiders](/Ducal+Spider "Dark Souls 2 Ducal Spider") in the same area (roughly 1% – needs confirmation).
  * Full set is dropped by [Maughlin the Armourer ](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") if he is killed.

### Tseldora Set Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * The [Tseldora Cap](/Tseldora+Cap "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Cap") increases souls gain by 2.5%
  * The [Tseldora Robe](/Tseldora+Robe "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Robe") increases souls gain by 5%
  * The [Tseldora Manchettes](/Tseldora+Manchettes "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Manchettes") increase souls gain by 10%
  * The [Tseldora Trousers](/Tseldora+Trousers "Dark Souls 2 Tseldora Trousers") increase souls gain by 5%
  * These effects stack with each other, and do not increase from upgrading the armor set.
