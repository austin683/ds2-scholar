**Chaos Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing. 

     _"Shield of darkness and chaos._

     _Once, a brilliant young sorcerer cast away his earthly desires, devoting himself entirely to the dark that bewitched him._

     _Nebulous, inky, and serene, the Dark holds an allure matched only by the fear  
it strikes in men's hearts. Could it be nature, holding a mirror to mankind?" _(Sotfs) 

### Acquired From
