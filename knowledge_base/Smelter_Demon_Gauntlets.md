### Smelter Demon Gauntlets Description

_"_ Gauntlets _of the Smelter Demon, a great mass of iron that was given life. High fire defense."_  
_"Armor of the Smelter Demon, a great mass of iron that was given life. High fire defense. The Old Iron King was possessed of a great bounty of ore, but was incinerated by a creature that rose from the infernal depths of the earth."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * This armor set is sold by [Maughlin the armourer](/Maughlin+the+armourer) in [Majula](/Majula) after you have killed the [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon)

### 

### Notes

  * 16 Str requirement
  * Requires [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite) to upgrade.
  * This Armor (completed set) has the best total fire resistance in the game when fully upgraded.(*Hexer set appears to have 1 more point in fire resistance)
  * If you kill Maughlin before defeating the Smelter Demon he will not sell the set. This may have been patched out. On the PC V 1.02, Maughlin can be killed and will still sell the set after beating the Smelter Demon.
  * The Smelter Demon Helm has the highest physical defence when fully upgraded, even surpassing Havel's helm (*Gyrm Warrior Greathelm +10 has the highest physical defence)
