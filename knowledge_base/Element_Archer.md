The reason it does not matter which element you pick is because your damage will be coming from the dexterity. The element is just to add elemental damage, and having a different arrow element I assume adds that element damage also. Not everyone has the same resistances so it's smart to have each one hitting them. Bow of Want has a slightly higher damage imbued with lightning. If the enemy is lightning resistant you are screwed.
