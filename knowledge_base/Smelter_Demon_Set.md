**Smelter Demon Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
_"Armor of the Smelter Demon, a great mass of iron that was given life. High fire defense."_   
_"Armor of the Smelter Demon, a great mass of iron that was given life. High fire defense. The Old Iron King was possessed of a great bounty of ore, but was incinerated by a creature that rose from the infernal depths of the earth."_

###  Set Location

  * Sold by [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+armourer) (35,3k) once [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon) is defeated (spend 15k souls at Maughlin's shop to unlock boss armor sets).

  
  
  
  

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite).
  * Upgraded stats are only 40% higher, not the usual 50%.
  * Helm offers second highest physical defenses (almost equal to those of [Gyrm](/Gyrm+Set) helm, regular [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior+Set) helm and [Velstadt's](/Velstadt's+Set) helm), except for strike defense.
  * Gauntlets offer the highest fire defense (equal to that of [Penal](/Penal+Set) cuffs), as well as second highest physical defenses (except for slash defense) and second highest poise (almost equal to that of [Looking Glass](/Looking+Glass+Set) gauntlets).
  * Leggings offer second highest poise (almost equal to that of [Looking Glass](/Looking+Glass+Set) and [Mastodon](/Mastodon+Set) leggings).
  * Requires 16 STR.
  * While fire defense is indeed high, it's not the highest (except for gauntlets): among medium and heavy armor pieces, higher fire defense is offered by [Syan's Helm](/Syan's+Set "Syan's helm"), [Alonne Captain](/Alonne+Captain+Set "Alonne Captain")'s and Syan's armor and boots, all of them upgraded with easier to obtain regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Titanite").
