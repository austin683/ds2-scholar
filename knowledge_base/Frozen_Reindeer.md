**Frozen Reindeer** is an [enemy](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. Made of ice crystals and sporting antelope-like horns, the **Frozen Reindeer** is a horse-like creature found in the [Frigid Outskirts](/Frigid+Outskirts "Dark Souls 2 Frigid Outskirts"). [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Dark Souls 2 Frozen Reindeer Information

A horse like creature made from ice crystals, with the horns of an antelope.

These enemies spawn at fixed points (quitting and reloading will cause them to respawn and rush at you from the exact same point; this method also confirms that there is a random chance of them spawning two at a time from the same point).

### Frozen Reindeer Strategy Tips in DKS2

  * These enemies seem to be weak to Strike damage. A Dark infused Sacred Chime Hammer hit for ~800 damage on NG+, killing them in 3 hits.  
These enemies can be staggered with two hits from a [Great Hammers](/Great+Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Great Hammers") (total 120 poise damage).  
**The moonlight knight** on GameFAQs points out that they can be pancaked with a downward great hammer attack (a la [Large Club](/Large+Club "Dark Souls 2 Large Club") and [Great Club](/Great+Club "Dark Souls 2 Great Club") 2HR2), provided the [Stone Ring](/Stone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Stone Ring") is used--but only when soloing!! I have confirmed this. (I digress. I had Vengarl and Abbess, I could "pancake" them without the stone ring, and with summons.)  
Edit: I this too, though didn't try with summons. I also tested infused versions with large club, and the reindeer seemed to be weak against dark (739 dmg with rob+1 and flynn's on sl 1) when lightning infused did barely over 500.  
Roll AWAY from the charging attack, not into it, as is usually the case with charging attacks.  
Edit by Loghriff: Try the Santier's spear with stone ring to stun to the death (just spam two-handed R1 with a sufficient amount of stamina). Tested on NG+ with a raw +5 Santier.  
  

  * Their evades will do damage if they jump into a player.  
They only spawn when the blizzard picks up, so that the player generally can't anticipate from where they will attack. Killing enough reindeer in each area will cause them to stop spawning entirely, making the way to the boss considerably less dangerous. The stretch between the 3rd building and the area boss seems to have three spawn zones, making them spawn very frequently requiring more kills in the area than usual to stop their spawning.  
One reindeer spawns per spawn point per blizzard. If you take too long to kill a reindeer, when the blizzard picks up again, another will spawn from the same spawn point.  
\- Note on spawning. There is are 2 spawn zones between the 1st and 2nd building, one zone close to each building along the way between them. There are another 2 zones between the 2nd and 3rd buildings, the _first zone_ is closest to the second building, the _second zone_ is a little over 3/4 the way there. There are 3 spawn zones between the 3rd building and the ramp down to the ice bridge at regular intervals.
  * Casting Heavenly Thunder nearby while they are fighting another player is mildly effective at wearing down their health, due to their largeness.
