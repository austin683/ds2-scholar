### Bandit Class Build for Dark Souls 2

The build that is listed below is a set of equipment and recommended stats that we see fit for the Bandit Class in Dark Souls 2. For more builds, check out our [PvE Builds](/PvE+Builds "Dark Souls 2 PvE Builds") and [PvP Builds](/PvP+Builds "Dark Souls 2 PvP Builds") pages to find various builds that have been created by the Fextralife team and its community.

_**Defender's Greatsword Build**_

  * This is one of the good **Bandit** builds that you can find in the **PVE Builds** page made by "IgnusKnavery". This build focuses on both miracles and melee. It centers around the Defender's Greatsword, because there's no other faith weapon that comes close when it comes to scaling. If you meet the requirements and pick this up at the end of your playthrough, infuse it with lighting. It scales S with faith. Raise your attunement to 25 so you can carry a combination of your favorite spells whether it be a few great lightning spears, pyromancy spells, or sacred oath._**

**Weapons**

  * Defender's Greatsword +5 with lightning infusion (scales S)
  * Dragon Lightning Chime +5
  * [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") +10
  * [Watcher's Shield](/Watcher's+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Watcher's Shield")

**Armor**

  * This is more personal preference. I maxed Faraam's for my medium armor and went with a mix of what looked good for my light armor.

**Rings**

  * [Third Dragon Ring](/Third+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Third Dragon Ring")
  * [Clear Bluestone Ring](/Clear+Bluestone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Clear Bluestone Ring") +2

### Notes and Tips About Bandit

Notes: The Bandit's claim to fame is that they start with a Short Bow, though their lack of arrows makes its usefulness questionable. When you run out, your only choice is to unlock [Blacksmith Lenigrast's](/Blacksmith+Lenigrast "Dark Souls 2 Blacksmith Lenigrast") shop, where you can get a free Short Bow anyway. Their intelligence is by far the lowest among all classes, which hurts the damage of fire or magic elemental weapons, but lightning is the better choice for most bosses anyway and this class starts with more Faith than the Warrior, Knight and Swordsman so use Gold Pine Resin. But it also makes the spell merchant Straid of Olaphis and Felkin the Outcast refuse to trade with you. and the Bandit's low attunement will make it difficult to equip a spell later on. Since ranged attacks aren't really needed in the first area of the game, it's probably a better idea to go with the more powerful Swordsman if you are interested in a high dexterity character. However, the Bandit is the best choice for players interested in a completely magic-free character, as their magical stats (Intelligence + Attunement + Faith) are the lowest of any class.
