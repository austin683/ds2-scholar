**Sweet Shalquoir** is an [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") in **Dark Souls 2. Sweet Shalquoir** can be found in the town of [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). She is a mysterious talking cat who resides in a building near the town's entrance. **Sweet Shalquoir** serves as a unique merchant, offering a variety of items for sale, including [Rings](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings"), [Spells](/Spells "Dark Souls 2 Spells"), and [Consumables](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables"). She also provides cryptic hints and insights into the world of Dark Souls 2, often speaking in riddles and vague references. 

### Sweet Shalquoir Information in Dark Souls 2

Sweet Shalquoir is a sentient feline creature found inside a house in Majula. She sells rings to the player and mainly uses scents to identify and characterize people. She possesses the unique ability to separate the player from their current covenant, much like Oswald the Pardoner from Dark Souls. When greeting people, she uses the term “Enchanté”, a French greeting meaning “Nice to meet you”, or literally, “Enchanted.” Shalquoir often likes to joke about memory issues to the player.

  * In her dialogue, she mentions various lore of the defeated bosses (or her own view) up until you obtain the [Ashen Mist Heart](/Ashen+Mist+Heart "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Mist Heart")
  * She will then guide you to trespass the [giants' memories](/Memory+of+Jeigh "Dark Souls 2 Memory of Jeigh") and take the [throne](/Throne+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Throne of Want").
  * Drops nothing.
  * Cannot be killed.
  * After acquiring a [Token of Spite](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite") she will mention how you are drenched in sin and that at least your mother is still proud. She'll say this after you acquire the Token of Spite from the chest in [The Pit](/The+Pit "Dark Souls 2 The Pit"), even if you have never used a [Cracked Red Eye Orb](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb") and none of the NPCs in your world have been killed (including Creighton/Pate/Licia/Ancient Dragon) and therefore definitively have a sin level of 0.
  * The Emerald Herald seems to know her well and mentions how she will give sound advice if you meet her “on a good day”.
  * It is possible to talk with her through the wall at the side of the house if she is scratching the wall
  * After you take the throne she will say:”It seems that we must now part. Why now? I don't see how it should matter. just because, because I'm a cat. hee hee...”. (She can also say this after obtaining the Giant Kinship.)

### Sweet Shalquoir Dialogue

**\- When first met**  
Oh…Undead, are we?  
And one without much time remaining.  
Just about ready to fall apart, I'd say.  
Not exactly the time to be chatting with a cat!  
Well, suit yourself.  
Oh, yes, you may call me Shalquoir. Enchanté.  
So, what did you want, anyway?  
Ooh, you smell wonderful. Hee hee hee…

**\- When talking to her to open the interaction menu before opening the Shrine of Winter**  
Oh…Who were you again?  
Hoh Hoh…Oh, I'm not serious.  
You do have a rather pleasant scent.  
The type I'm quite fond of. Hee hee hee…

**\- When talking to her with a Token of Spite in your inventory**  
Hoh Hoh! What's happened to you?  
You have that glint in your eyes.  
And the scent…Of one with quite the catalog of sins…  
Oh, don't feel bad. I'm sure your mother's still proud…Hee Hee!

**\- When leaving, having used her services**  
Satisfied?  
I'll be around if you ever come back.

**\- When leaving, without having used her services**  
Nothing suited you, I presume?  
Well, that's dismaying. Hee hee hee…

**\- When walking off without closing the menu**  
Oh my, haste makes waste. Hee hee hee…

**\- When talking in the interaction menu before opening the Shrine of Winter**  
This place is already dead.  
Everything will crumble and waste away, so that something new may be born.  
Isn't it wonderful? Hee hee hee…

**\- When talking in the interaction menu before opening the Shrine of Winter**  
This place is fascinating.  
We receive only the most peculiar visitors. Folk like yourself.  
It's enough to keep even a cat amused!

**\- When talking in the interaction menu before opening the Shrine of Winter**  
Are you going to see the Old Ones?  
Those four who have grown so incredibly ancient.  
They must have sprouted quite a thick coat of moss by now.  
For heaven's sake, no-one even knows their names anymore!  
Imagine that! Hee hee hee hee!  
Yes…Nothing like yourself.  
For you…have a most pleasant scent, that grows nicer with each passing day.

**\- When talking in the interaction menu before opening the Shrine of Winter**  
Have you made friends with the man by the sea?  
He's lost everything, absolutely everything. Hee Hee…  
The only thing he's good for now… Is a few tidbits on covenants.  
Covenants are a type of, well, contract, you might say.  
You give something, to gain something. That's the way humans like it, right?  
It might be just the thing you need. But what does a cat know? Hee hee hee…

**\- When talking in the interaction menu before opening the Shrine of Winter**  
Did you see that oddly-formed rock behind here?  
Long ago, they called it Victor's Stone, as I recall.  
If you wish to face greater challenges, speak to the rock.  
Although you'd just as well not. Hee hee hee…

**\- When talking to her to open the interaction menu after opening the Shrine of Winter**  
Well, you've grown quite a bit, haven't you?  
Your scent is lovelier than it's ever been. Hee hee hee…  
Why not trot along to the castle?  
And meet the King.  
Long ago, He smelled just like you.  
Not so much anymore, though.  
He's quite rancid by now.  
But we cats love that. It's an acquired taste!

**\- When talking in the interaction menu after opening the Shrine of Winter**  
Once, people tried to round up the Undead and hide them away from the world.  
They thought that imprisoning the Undead would solve the problem.  
They created a towering bastille to contain them, but in the end, it did no good.  
The Lost Sinner lives deep within the Bastille.  
The fool. Trying to light the First Flame…

**\- When talking in the interaction menu after opening the Shrine of Winter**  
Why do people try so hard to be beautiful?  
We cats are born beautiful, of course. Hee Hee…  
The human ego…How many ugly iron castles has it erected?  
And they don't even see the folly of their ways.  
But that's what makes watching humankind so delightful.  
It reminds me of someone who lived long ago.  
A vainglorious liar who ended up hurling himself into the flames.  
Now he's Ichorous Earth if I'm not mistaken.

**\- When talking in the interaction menu after opening the Shrine of Winter**  
You've seen that gaping hole here?  
Well, there's nasty little vermin down there.  
Although who you seek is even further below.  
And has been down there for a very, very long time.  
He's plumb Rotten by now, I'm sure! Hee hee hee…

**\- When talking in the interaction menu after opening the Shrine of Winter**  
Men develop the most peculiar fascinations.  
Sometimes their fascinations seem to take control.  
Till there's very little man left. Hee hee hee…  
Oh, it's like that awful traitor long ago.  
He coveted what he did not have, and it drove him mad.  
What a curious conundrum. Hee hee hee…  
The Writhing Ruin keeps searching as we speak.  
Searching for its heart's desire.

**\- When talking to her to open the interaction menu after meeting Queen Nashandra in Drangleic Castle**  
Oh, it's you.  
What're you doing here?  
Have you lost your way? Hee hee hee…  
I believe you're in search of the King.  
Well, he's keeping company with the dead.

**\- When talking to her to open the interaction menu after obtaining the King's Ring**  
You'll find a great creature far to the east.  
A colossal thing, with the strength to match its size.  
Or something playing the part at least.  
Open the door, and venture inside, and you'll soon smell even lovelier.

**\- When talking to her to open the interaction menu after obtaining the Ashen Mist Heart**  
Trespassing into their dreams?  
Of the ones who crossed the sea, lavishing ruin upon the land?  
How they savor their visions… Of glorious deeds in battle.  
Hee hee hee hee hee…

**\- When talking to her to open the interaction menu after obtaining the Giant's Kinship**  
It seems that we must now part.  
Why now? I don't see how it should matter.  
Just because, because I'm a cat. Hee Hee…  
Honourable Sovereign, take your throne.  
And do great things, if it, please.

**\- When attacked**  
Oh, what now? Hmph!  
(or)  
Ooh, keep trying.  
(or)  
Oh, spare me, please.
