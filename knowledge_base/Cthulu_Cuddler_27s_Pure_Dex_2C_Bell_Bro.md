#  Cthulu_Cuddler's Pure Dex, Bell Bro

  

####  So this is a build I've been having a lot of fun with. I keep him at SL25 and get TONS of action with the Bell Keepers. Feel free to interpret and change according to your style, but here's the idea-

####  I hated the swordsman on my first play, but I decided to revisit him. I pumped dex to 29, and str is at 9. Alvaa set (all +9) with wanderer manchettes +9 for armor, until I beefed up Creighton's set to +9 (has a bit more defense but less poise-you decide). Still using Manchettes though, ok defense and light weight.

####  Rings- Bell Keeper ring (DUH) Cloranthy +1, RoSP +1 and Old Sun Ring.

####  Now, get Ricard's rapier, and a falchion-mine are both at +10-not as hard as some might think. Get magic (or poison/bleed) on the Falchion (I have 1 poison and 1 magic, the magic I prefer for shields etc, scares them), but __POISON__ on Ricard's rapier. The R2 on the rapier is almost always going to stun and poison your target, if you can get it to hit them.

####  It should be noted that the poison will also hit through shields, so usually a few well placed strikes, or a full double R2 combo, will poison even the heartiest of turtlers-just watch your stamina and their reactions. Also- the R1 attack on the rapier should stun pretty much everybody, except full Havel's with Giants ring, which even then can still be stunned, but it will take a few connecting hits. So, you can stunlock with any attack from either weapon, if you time it right. (The R2x2 combo will usually stun on the 2nd or 3rd connecting hit, so be careful if you're using this while your opponent attacks or lunges at you)

####  Usually I start out with the running L1 on the falchion to make an opening, then R1 once or twice, followed by R2. This is DEVASTATING when done properly. Most likely your opponent will panic, and back away to try to use estus or gems-follow up with a running L1 again or running R1 and that's all she wrote. Occasionally I keep some poison/bleed throwing knives or Loyd's Talismans, just in case they get a head start on running away...

####  NOTES- You will be somewhat squishy! If you're normally a turtler/tank, this is probably not the build for you. If you are great at timing rolls/parrying, then you will definitely shine here. Be patient, be quick, and be cunning. My next goal is to get this char. Manslayer and Darkdrift, and see how dual wielding those go.

####  Have fun! Feel free to comment on thoughts, improvements etc

I use a higher level version of this build (SL 164) as I have higher Str and Dex so that I can basically two-hand/one-hand almost every weapon. I have recommended some key SL for people, I have shown this in the table. All of the stats can be changed to match someone's desired play style, however, remember the point of this build - Sorceries and MLGS/Blue Flame. If you use Simpleton's Spice on Soul Geyser then you can rank it down from 64 to about 50 which will allow for you to place an extra 10 points of your choosing **OR** have a lower SL.

I did two versions as I know some people like playing heavy while others like playing light, both are below 70% of the total weight so that you can still fast roll. I would like to explain some of the reasons why I picked what I picked and then I will add some extra's at the end.   
  
I will start with the armour I picked for now. I decided to create the heavy set using the armour I picked as it gives you a very sturdy defence, high poise and (in my eyes) looks pretty damn awesome ;). You can switch out armour pieces if you want as you will have some spare weight to play with or switch out the RSR+1 (Royal Soldier's Ring+1) for a different ring, it's purely down to personal preference. The light set was put together for a few different reasons, mainly the cast speed. The head is purely down to what you want, you can have the Black Witch Hat (Which I didn't mention in the table) for an extra attunement slot but I don't understand why you would want that when you have 5 slots from the stats and the another 2-3 with the SRB+1/2 (Southern Ritual Band+1/2). You could then use either the Black hood for an extra 2 INT and faster cast speed or the Hexer's Hood for increased spell uses, example 4 Soul Spears would become 6 - [2+1] + [2+1] = 6. The chest and gloves are both used as they both increase cast speed and I wouldn't recommend switch them out, you need cast speed to surprise your enemy. Havel's Legs would be used for the extra poise and defence just so that you can take a few hits (being a glass caster sucks), however, you can switch them out for the Lion Mage Legs for the cast speed.   
  
Next up are the weapons. This whole build is based upon the MLGS but you can use a few other weapons, like the blue flame. The blue flame can be used to surprise your opponent as, lets be honest, a sword which can caster spells is scary as S!&*. I saw someone suggest using two Blue Flames and casting CMW (Crystal Magic Weapon) on the Right Handed one and attacking while duel wielding as most people don't suspect a duel wielder to cast spells and I agree with him, it's a surprise tactic that can allow you to combo your opponent. Downside to that is that once the tactic has been used in a fight it can't be used again as you won't have the advantage of surprise. Anyways going back to the MLGS, which you can buff with magic to change it's INT rating from A to S. I personally didn't do this as it lowers your basic magic physical attack from 380 to 308 (could be 304). If you have 60 INT you will do about 10-20 damage more with a magic infused MLGS+5 than a normal MLGS+5 but it's up to personal preference whether you do it as if you don't have 60 INT you will gain less from the S rating. The Staff of Wisdom+5 is a must, in my opinion it's the best staff in the game (I'm not sure if people would agree). It requires 50 INT (which you will have with this build) and it has an S in INT which is absolutely awesome! Next you have the Avelyn with Fire or Lightning (doesn't matter which as it's purely personal choice) which I use against people with no shields, people trying to cast, people trying to heal or to buy myself some time/distance. A shield isn't necessary for this build but you could put one on and if I was to put one on I would most likely use a stamina regen shield just to help boost the stamina regen.   
  
Rings are very optional with this build as you have fairly good stats which can rule out certain rings. In my eyes the Third Dragon Ring is a necessity, it gives you a bonus of 7.5% HP, 10% Stamina and 10% Equip Load (Correct me if I'm wrong). Like the Third Dragon Ring the Southern Ritual Band+1/2 is also a necessity as it gives you an extra 2-3 attunement slots depending on what version you use. That leaves you with two ring spots to spare, unless you use the Royal Soldier's Ring. I like to switch out my 4th ring from the Chloranthy Ring+1/2 to the Illusory Ring of the Exalted (which I was lucky enough to get off of a friend!). The Chloranthy Ring+1/2 will give you a stamina regen which will allow you to do more of everything (including spamming spells for those who like to do it ;)). For those who don't know what the Illusory Ring of the Exalted does, it makes your Right Hand weapon invisible which means you can hide a MLGS+5 with CMW on it from your opponents. As for how you get it, I believe you get it by completing the game with out resting at any bonfires ( I think, again correct me if I'm wrong).   
  
I just have to add in what spells you should use, although this is again optional.   
I use the following:   

  * Soul Spear
  * Soul Spear
  * Crystal Soul Spear
  * Crystal Homing Soulmass
  * Crystal Magic Weapon
  * Soul Greatsword
  * Soul Geyser

  
All the Soul Spears are extremely good, especially Crystal Soul Spear. I use Crystal Soul Spear at the beginning of the match in conjunction with Crystal Homing Soulmass. If they roll towards you to evade the CSS (Crystal Soul Spear) then the CHS (Crystal Homing Soulmass) tends to hit them. I use Crystal Magic Weapon to enhance either the Blue Flame or MLGS as it makes you deal some serious damage. As for the Soul Greatsword... Well I like to use it when my opponent is either healing, hiding behind an object or getting too close to me. Don't get me wrong it is fairly easy to dodge but it's also very powerful and very easy to misjudge. When I use it I tend to hit 1100 which can make it a lot easier for you. Then finally you have Soul Geyser, I don't have to say that much about this spell apart from the fact that it shoots 4 Soul Spears at once... It's very slow to cast but INCREDIBLY powerful. Be warned though, It is a slow spell to cast so be careful when you cast it!   
  
Overall this build can be adapted very successfully to meet certain players needs and wants. I have added 30 Str and 30 Dex so that I can use any weapon that I find, basically, and with that ability I like to use the Gwym Great Hammer+10 with CMW (Crystal Magic Weapon) and the Illusory Ring of the Exalted (So that the opponent can't see my weapon) and then use the heavy attack to do a two-hit spinning attack, which for me hits 1500+ easily as well as knocking down the opponent.
