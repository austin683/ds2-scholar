**Endings** for [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki") entail the final two conclusions to the game's story. One of the endings can only be acquired after [Patch 1.10](/Patch+Notes "Dark Souls 2 Patch Notes") of the original game or on _Dark Souls II, Scholar of the First Sin_ edition. Certain conditions must be met to unlock this choice, namely defeating [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") and speaking to Aldia at all three available locations he appears at. These locations are the last activated Primal Bonfire, at the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"), and in the [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine").

### What Do You Want, Truly?

_You, who would link the fire, you, who would bare the curse..._

_Once the fire is linked, souls will flourish anew, and all of this will play out again._

_It is your choice... to embrace, or renounce this..._

_Great Sovereign, take your throne._

_What lies ahead, only you can see._

The default ending to the game, after defeating either [Queen Nashandra](/Nashandra "Dark Souls 2 Nashandra") or [Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin](/Aldia,+scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Aldia, scholar of the First Sin") the giants will come to life and complete the path to the [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Throne of Want"). The player sits upon the throne, continuing the cycle of kings and kingdoms, what happens next only they know.

### Or Something Else Entirely...

_There is no path._

_Beyond the scope of light, beyond the reach of Dark..._

_...what could possibly await us?_

_And yet, we seek it, insatiably..._

_Such is our fate._

Provided the conditions for [Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin](/Aldia,+scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Aldia, scholar of the First Sin") to appear have been met, the player may instead choose to leave the [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want "Dark Souls 2 Throne of Want") through the fog gate, refusing to become part of the cycle and seeking another way to end the curse.

### Post-Credits

  * After the credits the player will return to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), where [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus") can be triggered manually at the [The Far Fire](/The+Far+Fire "Dark Souls 2 The Far Fire") bonfire.
