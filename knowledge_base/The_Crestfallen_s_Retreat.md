#  The Crestfallen's Retreat

* * *

##  Location:

[The Far Fire](/The+Far+Fire) -> They way to the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants) is to your right if you face the near cliff. Go down that path. You will find a closed gate (there is a bigger one to left side of the small one you will see first, that's the one to open) but there is a lever right next to it in the wall to open it. At the end of the hallway there is a little wooden bridge, go over it and right after that down the ramp. You are now in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants). Just go straight ahead over the little river and you are at the bonfire.
