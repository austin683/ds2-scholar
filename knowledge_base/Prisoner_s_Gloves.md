### Prisoner's Gloves Description

"Rags worn by imprisoned Hollows. This appears to have been worn on the head (body, arms, hip).  
Judging by its looks and apparent virtues, this really is no more than a tattered scrap of cloth. It still carries the stench of a Hollow."

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Dropped by the Prisoner enemies in [The Gutter](/Gutter).
  * Dropped by the Hollows in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse).
  * Dropped by the Hollows in [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt) (rare)
  * Dropped by the Hollows in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley)

### 

### Notes

  * One way to obtain the entire set is to fight hollows just after the 2nd Undead Crypt bonfire; they spawn infinitely (throughout multiple gravestones) and do not require a rest at the bonfire for them to respawn (albeit, the drop rate is rarer than in other locations).
