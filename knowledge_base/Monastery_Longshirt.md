_"A traditional sacred headcloth/longshirt/gloves/skirt crafted at Lindelt Monastery. Made of lightweight, flowing white fabric._  
  
_The ceremonial design suggests that they revered whatever it was they watched over."_

### Location

  * Pieces of the armor can be dropped from a Black phantom found behind a painting in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep") (NG+).

### Notes

  * Part of the [Painting Guardians](/Painting+Guardian+Phantom "Dark Souls 2 Painting Guardian Phantom"). 
    * Is the armor set of the Painting Guardians from Dark Souls 1.
  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite.](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")
  * Farming advice: bring a lot of lightning and poison arrows for the two trolls before the boss entrance. They don't aggro if you have a little bit of distance.
