**Magic Barrier** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle.

> "A miracle encasing the body in a magic barrier.  
> Increases resistance to magic, lightning, fire and dark.  
>   
> This miracle is said to shield its caster with the Rock's armor, and was common amongst the wizard knights of Mirrah."

### Acquired From

  * [Felkin the Outcast](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast"), for 2700 souls.
  * [Head of Vengarl](/Head+of+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Head of Vengarl") for 2700 souls

### Notes

  * Small area of effect, will give a barrier to summons if close enough.
  * Increases elemental defenses by 150. This does not stack with Flash Sweat.
  * "The Rock" is a reference to Havel the Rock, a character from Dark Souls and the original wearer of [Havel's Set](/Havel%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Havel%27s Set"), who used the miracle to combat sorcerers.
  * As of Patch 1.04, the duration of the Magic Barrier depends on the user's faith. At 10 FTH, even if you meet the spell requirements (lowered with skeptic spice) the spell will last about 20 seconds. At 20 FTH it lasts about 80 seconds. From 30 to 50 FTH 90 seconds. It is yet unknown if you can extend the duration of the spell by increasing FTH further.
