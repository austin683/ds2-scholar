     _"Armor of the ferocious Vengarl of Forossa._

     _Vengarl was known as a raging, deadly warrior. Even Forossa's Lion Knights, a motley crew of rabid fighters, kept him at arm's length._

     _As Vengarl's helmet suggests, he was not unlike a mad beast on the battlefield."_

###  Set Location

  * Helm is given by [Head of Vengarl](/Head+of+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Head of Vengarl") found in the clearing of the foggy part of [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"). Exhaust all of his dialogue options to receive the helm.
  * Other pieces are dropped by [Vengarl's body](/Headless+Vengarl "Dark Souls 2 Headless Vengarl"), found next to primal bonfire past [The Duke's Dear Freja ](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja"). 
    * [Scholar of the First Sin] Vengarl's body is found in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods"), past Shaded Ruins bonfire, below the arena occupied by [Manscorpion Tark](/Manscorpion+Tark "Dark Souls 2 Manscorpion Tark") (petrified [Lion Warriors](/Lion+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Warrior") on either side, revive one of them to pass).

  
  
  

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Upgraded stats are only 40% higher, not the usual 50%.
  * Helm grants +2 to VIT.
  * In addition to fearsome looks, helm offers defenses on par with light/medium armor chestpieces.
