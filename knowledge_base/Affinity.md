**Affinity** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> "An advanced hex based on an ancient sorcery. Creates a dark mass that seems to pursue its target with a will of its own.  
>   
> It appears to be a manifestation of an emotion. Perhaps of hate, perhaps of love.  
>   
> Catalyst: staff"

### Acquired From

  * [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis"), [Kobolds](/Kobold "Dark Souls 2 Kobold") outside of [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep").  

    * Can be dropped by the [Prowler Hounds](/Prowler+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Prowler Hound") outside of Aldia's Keep.

### Notes

  * Similar to Pursuers from DkS1. Cast several orbs that deal dark damage. The orbs target and home to the closest enemy. This spell is useful for setting up other spells in PvP, ie. [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Great Resonant Soul").
  * The number of orbs depends on the Int stat. The maximum number of orbs (5 orbs) can be obtained at 60 Int. 1 orb at 20 Int and every additional 10 Int adds another orb.
  * This spell doesn't scale with whatever staff you're using, but it scales with your dark BNS. (I used it on black witch staff +10 and untouched sorcerer's staff, both had exactly 800 damage).
  * Not affected by [Unleash Magic](/Unleash+Magic "Dark Souls 2 Unleash Magic").
  * Once cast, the orbs will last for 30 seconds before disappearing. The duration is not affected by the [Lingering Dragoncrest Ring](/Lingering+Dragoncrest+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Lingering Dragoncrest Ring"), as mentioned on the rings page.
  * If an orb hits something, it will disappear. If you cast Affinity before crossing a fog gate, you will lose all the orbs.
