### Dingy Cuffs Description

_"An unassuming dingy cuffs._  
  
_Although by now gray with soot and nearly unraveled, its fabric was originally a pure white"_  
  
_"An unassuming dingy skirt._  _Originally pure white._  
  
_A close inspection reveals old dried blood. What tragedy could have befallen its original owner?"_
