_"Helm of the Smelter Demon, a great mass of iron that was given life. High fire defense._

_"Armor of the Smelter Demon, a great mass of iron that was given life. High fire defense. The Old Iron King was possessed of a great bounty of ore, but was incinerated by a creature that rose from the infernal depths of the earth."_

### Location

  * The full set is sold by [Maughlin the armourer](/Maughlin+the+armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the armourer") in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") after you have killed the [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon").

### Notes

  * Part of the [Smelter Demon Set](/Smelter+Demon+Set "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon Set").  

    * This Armor has the best total fire resistance in the game when fully upgraded.(*Hexer set appears to have 1 more point in fire resistance)
    *   * Requires [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to upgrade.
  * 16 [Strength](/Strength "Dark Souls 2 Strength") required to equip.
  * If you kill Maughlin before defeating the Smelter Demon he will not sell the set. This may have been patched out. On the PC V 1.02, Maughlin can be killed and will still sell the set after beating the Smelter Demon.
  * Only surpassed by the [Gyrm Warrior Greathelm](/Gyrm+Warrior+Greathelm "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior Greathelm"), the Smelter Demon Helm has the second highest physical defense when fully upgraded, even surpassing Havel's helm.
