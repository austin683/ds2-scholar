**[Illusory Walls](/Illusory+Walls "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Walls")** are empty walls that appear like a solid structure, but can be cleared to reveal the space behind the wall. Players will need to interact with these walls to reveal the assagess or location behind them. Striking illusory walls will not open them, as players could do in Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1. To interact with them, press **A on the XBox 360 or X on the PS3 (Shift + Left Click on PC).** These walls are often encountered in closed walled spaces and tend to blend in with the rest of the structure of the location. This makes them easily missble in a regular playthrough if players are not actively seeking them out. Below is a list of all found Illusory Walls in Dark Souls 2.

**[Rare Items](/Rare+Items "Dark Souls 2 Rare Items")** that have lower or rarer drop rates have been sorted into rare items for the collector's convenience. These are usually obtained as loot drops from enemies but may have low drop rate percentages or are hard to come by when traversing the Locations. Here, they are sorted into Treasure and Enemy Drops, Non-invading Red Phantom Gear, Invading Red Phantom Gear, and Rewards for Feats of Skill.

## Dark Souls 2 Rare Drops Guide

### Treasure and Enemy Drops

General treasure obtained in a variety of ways as well as drops from in game non-human (non-player character model) enemies

  * [Engraved Gauntlets](/Engraved+Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Engraved Gauntlets")  
Obtained from a chest in lower [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"), the door way leading to said chest is locked and requires a key obtained by completing Pate/Creighton's story line (regardless of who you assist). These gauntlets add an approximately 5% chance of a critical damage bonus to any(?) attack made by the wearer.

  * [Invisible Aurous Set](/Aurous+Set "Dark Souls 2 Aurous Set")  
This transparent armor set can be obtained by talking to [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") in Majula once you have spent 16000+ souls in his shop (he will gain a cocky attitude once this requisite has been met) and then talk to him with 0 souls in your possession for him to give you the set out of pity. Each piece of this set increases the characters maximum equipment burden. Also can drop from invading phantom Rhoy the Explorer in the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints"). Rhoy will ONLY invade if you are OFFLINE.

  * [Pickaxe](/Pickaxe "Dark Souls 2 Pickaxe")  
A unique Greatclub class weapon that is low weight and packs a punch though many of the mechanics required to optimize its damage (Leo Ring compatibility, optimal damage hitbox, etc.) are still under study. This item is found in lower [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") in the chamber past the bridge over the damaging crystal pit. Specifically it is found beneath a small patch of brown/black mushrooms on the floor of said chamber, these mushrooms can only be removed by a "pig" type enemy lured from the peasant camp in upper Brightstone Cove Tseldora. This is considered a "less rare item" because it is a guaranteed drop as long as you can get the pig down to the proper spot.

  * [Shadow Set](/Shadow+Set "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Set"), [Malformed Claws](/Malformed+Claws "Dark Souls 2 Malformed Claws"), [Shadow Dagger](/Shadow+Dagger "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Dagger")  
An armor set and weapons belonging to King Vendrick's hired shadow men, These items can be obtained as a drop from the two "Suspicious Shadows" that assist the Flexile Sentry in its NG+ boss fight in [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man%27s Wharf"). The items have a low drop rate and are obtained piece by piece but the enemies will respawn infinitely as long as the boss isn't killed. To effectively farm these items wear all item discovery boosting items and enter the boss room, kill the two shadows while avoiding the boss and after collecting any items from the shadows quickly go into your menu and quit the game. Once you reload the game you will be outside the boss room and re-entry will spawn the shadows again, repeat as needed. If avoiding the boss during farming proves difficult you can summon [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah") to act as a meat shield though this lengthens the time for each farming run as you have to dismiss her before you quit the game and have to go back and get her for each run. 

  * [Ruin Set](/Ruin+Set "Dark Souls 2 Ruin Set")  
The armor set of the Ruin Sentinel bosses/enemies. This set is only known to drop from the 5 Ruin sentinels found in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") behind golem doors near the first bonfire. The drop rate on these is low and so item discovery boosts are recommended. One successful strategy for farming the sentinels is to open one Golem door with a sentinel behind it and then farm that particular sentinel till it despawns and then open another Golem door and repeat the process, this helps prevent other sentinels from sneaking up on you which happens often if you open all the Golem doors at once. You get a total of 75 (15 x5) chances to get the armor set before needing to ascetic the nearest bonfire, also the sentinels can drop duplicates of armor pieces which can slow the process of getting the full set.

  * [Heide Knight Set](/Heide+Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight Set")  
The armor worn by the three knights of Heide found throughout Drangleic, this armor is only dropped in NG+ and beyond and is not a guaranteed drop. While any of the three Heide knights can drop pieces of the armor they tend to drop their weapons more often than not, on a positive note the knights will always drop _something_ so you don't need to worry about completely fruitless runs. The Heide knight each only spawn once per new game cycle, thus ascetic use is required to farm the set, making the sword knight in the forest of fallen giants and the spear knight in the lost Bastille the preferable targets for farming being close to bonfires without an area boss. The Heide Knight Set also drop on NG in SOTFS.

  * [Black Witch Domino Mask](/Black+Witch+Domino+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch Domino Mask")  
Drops from the dual Avelyn wielding phantoms in [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol"). This helm gives a slight bonus to spell damage done when equipped.

  * [Black Witch Veil](/Black+Witch+Veil "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch Veil")  
Drops from the Witch phantom in [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol"). This is the female version of the Black Witch Hat Navlaan sells.

  * [Dragon Sage Hood](/Dragon+Sage+Hood "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Sage Hood")  
Rare drop from the Large Basilisk in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep"). 

  * [Black Hollow Mage Set](/Black+Hollow+Mage+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Hollow Mage Set"), [Lizard Staff](/Lizard+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Lizard Staff")  
Rare drops from the necromancers in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse"), in the cave right before the Skeleton Lords. These two NPCs do not respawn unless an ascetic is used, however the necromancers in the Executioner's Chariot fight can also drop these pieces. The necromancers in the Executioner's Chariot fight will respawn for each attempt at the boss, until the boss is killed. 

  * [Red Lion Warrior Cape](/Red+Lion+Warrior+Cape "Dark Souls 2 Red Lion Warrior Cape"), [Lion Warrior Helm](/Lion+Warrior+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Lion Warrior Helm")  
Rare drops from the golden lion warrior in the room connecting to Manscorpion Tark's arena near the [Shaded Ruins](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") bonfire. This NPC follows normal mob despawning mechanics.

  * [Manikin Claws](/Manikin+Claws "Dark Souls 2 Manikin Claws")  
Semi-rare drop from the three manikin soldiers before the Covetous Demon's boss arena in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley"). These enemies are found by walking off the stairs and landing on a platform that juts out of the wall. 

  * [Chaos Rapier](/Chaos+Rapier "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Rapier"), [Chaos Shield](/Chaos+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Shield")  
Rare drops from the single Enhanced Undead before the Guardian Dragon fight in [Aldia's Manor](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep"). In SOTFS, these can be bought from Felkin.

  * [Gyrm Warrior Greathelm](/Gyrm+Warrior+Greathelm "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior Greathelm")  
Rare drop from Gyrm Warriors in [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros").

### Non-invading Red Phantom Gear

The following entries are rare/unique weapons and armor obtained from killing non-invading red phantom enemies, other red phantoms that drop items that can be obtained by other methods will not be listed.

  * [Dingy Set](/Dingy+Set "Dark Souls 2 Dingy Set")  
Obtained from a miracle casting red phantom found on the players way to the [Gutter](/Gutter "Dark Souls 2 Gutter") in NG+, 100% guaranteed drop and is pre upgraded to +5 out of 10, be wary though, this phantom has a friend in Faraam armor (drops a great hero soul) and a number of exploding mummies nearby to help it. This is the only set in the game where you have to be in true NG+ and bonfire ascetics will not work.

  * [Mad Warrior Set](/Mad+Warrior+Set "Dark Souls 2 Mad Warrior Set"), [Berserker Blade](/Berserker+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Berserker Blade")  
This armor set and katana drops from a red phantom enemy randomly found in [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") if you are a member of the Bellkeeper Covenant. The Mad warrior spawns an infinite number of times but does so at random so even if you don't see him after 20 runs it just means your having some bad luck, do not use an ascetic. This phantom also will drop duplicates, though while seen to dual wield the [Berserker Blade](/Berserker+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Berserker Blade") it will only drop one at a time (confirmed it drops duplicates ver.1.09 cal 1.12). You do NOT need to ascetic to reset drops for duplicates.

  * [Durgo's Hat](/Durgo%27s+Hat "Dark Souls 2 Durgo%27s Hat")  
Obtained from the red phantom found near the [Kings Gate](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") leading to the Throne of Want. Drop rate uncertain. This stylish hat boosts the effective range of arrows. Can also be obtained from a chest in [Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Eleum Loyce") behind the [Pharros Door](/Pharros%27+Contraption "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Contraption") after the two ballistae.

  * **[Catarina Set](/Catarina+Set "Dark Souls 2 Catarina Set")**  
The good ol' onion bro armor from Dark Souls I is obtained from a red phantom found wearing it in NG+ in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"), specifically the area with all the old iron clad soldiers near the Soldier's Rest bonfire. This red phantom only spawns once per new game cycle and has a low/medium drop rate, due to its location close to a bonfire without an area boss it is possible to farm the armor set via bonfire ascetic use after each kill. This can take a while though due to the increasing strength of the phantom and low drop rate, as many as 24 ascetics have been required to obtain the full armor set. Edit: As of the start of the Lost Crown trilogy the Catarina set is made available in chests in each dlc as a piece, the Onion helm in the Sunken Crown dlc and Onion gauntlets and leggings in the Old Iron Crown dlc, and the Onion armor in the Ivory Crown dlc. 

  * [Visible Aurous Set](/Aurous+Set "Dark Souls 2 Aurous Set")  
This armor set is the opaque twin to the transparent set given to the player by [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer"). Its stats and weight are higher than the transparent set but it does not boost equipment load. It is a rare-ish drop from the red phantom wearing it on the ng+ [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man%27s Wharf") ship. This phantom does not respawn after death, so bonfire ascetics are needed to respawn him. Due to the wharf only having one bonfire you'll also have to kill the boss every time you want to use an ascetic making this a rather long run. In the SOTFS remake, this set can be found in a metal chest in the Gutter, where the [Ring of the Evil Eye +1](/Ring+of+the+Evil+Eye "Dark Souls 2 Ring of the Evil Eye") used to be.

  * [Monastery Set](/Monastery+Set "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Set"), [Monastery Scimitar](/Monastery+Scimitar "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Scimitar")  
This equipment set is a remake of the Painting Guardian set and sword from Dark Souls I. The red phantom who drops this is found behind a painting in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep"). This is yet another red phantom that requires bonfire ascetics to farm, the bonfire in question is the "Ritual site" bonfire found behind an illusory wall halfway down the stairs to the acid pit in Aldia's keep. Each time you kill the phantom you will also need to kill the area boss in order to allow ascetic use making this one quite a pain.

### Invading Red Phantom Gear

These items are obtained from red phantom enemies that invade a players world in mimicry of online play. These kinds of enemies can only be respawned via bonfire ascetic use.

  * [Old Mirrah Greatsword](/Old+Mirrah+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Old Mirrah Greatsword")  
This sword is a very rare drop from the invading NPC "Aslatiel Of Mirrah" in the front hallway of [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep"). This is a fairly painless weapon to farm as the bonfire that you must ascetic has no area boss tied to it allowing for free and easy ascetic use, however, the drop rate for the item is abysmally low. This weapon used to be identical in every way to the normal [Mirrah Greatsword](/Mirrah+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Mirrah Greatsword"), but it has since been nerfed and is now worse in every way.

  * [Priestess Set](/Priestess+Set "Dark Souls 2 Priestess Set")  
This armor set can be obtained from two invading NPCs; Merciless Roenna near the Skeleton Lords boss fog in [Huntsman Copse](/Huntsman+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman Copse") and Peculiar Kindular who invades in the section just before the Demon of Song boss fog in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana"), sadly either one of these requires a boss fight for continued ascetic use thus it is recommended to heavily farm Kindular as she is the only one of the two who can drop the head piece of the set despite the boss required for farming being "harder". This armor set can also drop from the Priestess in the Dragon Shrine. In Scholar of the First Sin, the set can be obtained from a corpse inside the illusion wall that precedes the Prowling Magus and Congregation boss fight.

  * [Warlock Mask](/Warlock+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Warlock Mask"), [Cursed Bone shield](/Cursed+Bone+shield "Dark Souls 2 Cursed Bone shield")  
It is recommended that one farms the Aldia Warlock that spawns near the fourth bonfire in the [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana") to obtain these items. Merciless Roenna, who invades just before the Skeleton Lord boss fog in [Huntsman Copse,](/Huntsman+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman Copse") can also be farmed for them, but this requires defeating the sickle wielding red phantoms and Skeleton Lords every time an ascetic is used, making it difficult to pull off depending on your luck.

### Rewards for Feats of Skill

These items are given to the player upon completion of some great task or challenge.

  * [Lingering Dragoncrest Ring+2](/Lingering+Dragoncrest+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Lingering Dragoncrest Ring")  
To obtain this ring you must defeat 1000 dark spirits, whether solely as the host or as a summoned phantom is unknown. It is hypothesized that red phantom enemies such as the Mad Warrior may count toward this goal as they count for ranking up in the Bellkeeper Covenant. 

  * [Ring of Thorns+2](/Ring+of+Thorns "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Thorns")  
To obtain this ring you must Slay 1000 hosts as a dark spirit, unknown if arbiter spirit invasions count or if killing summoned phantoms counts toward this goal.

  * [Illusory Ring of a Conqueror](/Illusory+Ring+of+a+Conqueror "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of a Conqueror")  
To obtain this ring the player must clear a game cycle (NG, NG+ etc) without dying even once, deaths as a summoned phantom do count as do deaths as an invader. This ring turns your left hand weapon/shield invisible.

  * [Illusory Ring of the Exalted](/Illusory+Ring+of+the+Exalted "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of the Exalted")  
To obtain this ring the player must clear the game without resting at a bonfire. Dying and then respawning at a bonfire that the player has lit does not break this requirement nor does using a Homeward Bone, Aged Feather or the Darksign to warp to a bonfire. Using a Primal Bonfire to warp back to Majula also does not count. This ring turns your right hand weapon invisible.

**[Traps](/Traps "Dark Souls 2 Traps")** are elements, rigged items or environmental hazards that can be encountered in the game unexpectedly, causing negative effects on the player. They can pose or be disguised as different regular items that can normally be activated in the game, which makes them dangerous if unaware. Their effects can be triggered or activated by entering specific areas as you explore each of the Locations, but are mostly activated by interacting with an object whilst unknowingly knowing that it is a trap. Below lists information on the types of traps and objects that can be encountered while playing DS2 along with their effects and what to watch out for. 

## Dark Souls 2 Traps

#### DS2 Chest Traps

These Chest Traps are rigged chests disguised as regular loot chests. They are encountered through Dark Souls 2 and vary in effects depending on the kind of trap it is rigged with. These traps are designed to waste a players time or deal negative effects to the player when intereacted with. Below are the types of chest traps you can find in the game. 

**Arrow Chest**

  * The arrow chest reveals a crossbow when opened, which shoots out a five-way spread of crossbow bolts in 3 separate waves upon opening.

**Poison Chest**

  * The Poison Chest is a fake chest which may or may not actually contain items. Opening it releases a gas that poisons nearby players and the opener with a deadly poison that acts very fast. This is capable of quickly killing players who do not have curing items or spells since the poison can last for a good time and easily out-damage the effects of healing items.

**Radiant Trap Chest**

  * The Radiant Chest is a chest which releases a radiant trap, mostly the same as Arrow Chest or Poison Chest, but it occasionally emits red mist which heals the player. It can appear in any trapped chest location, but it is incredibly rare.

**Wooden Chest**

  * Not technically a trap, but if a Wooden Chest is destroyed, the items it contains are destroyed with it, turning into [Rubbish](/Rubbish "Dark Souls 2 Rubbish").

**Explosive Chest**

  * A chest containing a bomb. It will explode seconds after ignition, dealing fire damage. The blast will not destroy the chest itself.

#### DS2 [Mimic](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic")

Mimics are [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") disguised as a chest. High-damaging series of attacks, often fatal. Mimics are rare, and can be wooden or metal chests. They can be identified by checking for a lock on the front of the chest - if the chest has a large lock on the front, this indicates a Mimic. Always test a suspected chest by smacking it from the side with a weapon or spell; it will trigger the mimic without the risk of the player being grabbed by the initial attack, which is usually an instant kill. Mimics can also be tested by throwing a [Lloyd's Talisman](/Lloyd%27s+Talisman "Dark Souls 2 Lloyd%27s Talisman") at them, which will make them yawn and fall asleep. The first 4 of the 5 Mimics in Dark Souls 2 contain pieces of the [Dark Set](/Dark+Set "Dark Souls 2 Dark Set").

#### DS2 [Cursed Vessel](/Cursed+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Cursed Vessel")

Cursed Vessels that appear as stone jars are an irritating hazard that causes [Curse](/Status+Effects "Dark Souls 2 Status Effects") buildup if you get too close. Their presence is always presaged by giggling and whimpering from their location. Ideally, break them from afar to avoid being affected by their effects.
