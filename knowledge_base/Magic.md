**Magic** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** can be used for damaging opponents, healing oneself, or increasing defensive or offensive properties. Spells and Magic in Dark Souls 2 are sorted into four classes, [Sorceries](/Sorceries "Dark Souls 2 Sorceries"), [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies"), [Miracles](/Miracles "Dark Souls 2 Miracles"), and [Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes"). To use any kind of magic, the player would first need to learn the spell and equip a weapon or catalyst that corresponds to the spell's magic class. The player can equip magic at [Bonfires](/Bonfires "Dark Souls 2 Bonfires"). **Magic** is usually enchanted to various weapons and used as an infusion that can be used offensively or defensively. All information and descriptions on Magic, Spell types, and uses in Dark Souls 2 can be found below. 

### DKS2 All Magic Classes

In Dark Souls II, the use of magic is a versatile and strategic aspect of gameplay, providing players with various options for dealing damage, healing, and enhancing defensive or offensive capabilities. The magic system is divided into four distinct classes: Sorceries, Pyromancies, Miracles, and Hexes. Each class corresponds to different magical elements and scales with specific attributes, creating a diverse set of playstyles.

[Sorceries](/Sorceries "Dark Souls 2 Sorceries") focus on soul magic and scale with Intelligence (INT), allowing players to unleash powerful arcane spells. [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies"), on the other hand, involve fire magic and scale equally with both Intelligence and Faith (FTH). [Miracles](/Miracles "Dark Souls 2 Miracles") center around holy and lightning magic, scaling primarily with Faith. [Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes"), a unique category, utilize dark, soul-based magic and scale with either Intelligence or Faith, depending on which attribute is lower.

**DS2 Magic Classes**

  * **[Sorceries](/Sorceries "Dark Souls 2 Sorceries")** \- Soul magic (scales with INT)
  * **[Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies")** \- Fire magic (scales with INT and FTH equally)
  * **[Miracles](/Miracles "Dark Souls 2 Miracles")** \- Holy / lightning magic (scales with FTH)
  * **[Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes")** \- Dark, soul-utilizing magic (scales with either INT or FTH, whichever stat is lowest)

### DKS2 Cast Amount

Spells have limited amounts of casts before they are depleted, but resting at a Bonfire will fully replenish them. Consumable Items such as [Amber herb](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb"), [Twilight Herb](/Twilight+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Twilight Herb"), [Rouge Water](/Rouge+Water "Dark Souls 2 Rouge Water"), and [Crimson Water](/Crimson+Water "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Water") can also restore spell uses.

  
For those seeking to expand their magical repertoire, it is possible to attune multiple spell scrolls of the same type simultaneously. This means that if a player possesses multiple copies of a spell, they can attune the spell multiple times, effectively increasing the number of available casts. Multiple spell scrolls of the same type can be attuned at once. For example, attuning a [Lightning Spear](/Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Lightning Spear") scroll grants 3 casts, but if the player has two Lightning Spear scrolls, they can attune the spell twice, granting 6 casts (provided they have at least two Attunement slots).

### How to use Magic in Dark Souls II

To harness the power of magic, players must first learn a spell by obtaining the corresponding spell scroll, either through discovery or purchase from a merchant. The next step involves attuning the acquired spell at a Bonfire, a crucial resting point in the game. This process enables players to equip and cast spells using specialized catalysts such as Staves for Sorceries, Chimes for Miracles, and Flames for Pyromancies. Hexes can be cast using either Chimes or Staves, depending on the preference of the player.

  1. Obtain a spell scroll, either by finding it or buying it from a merchant
  2. Attune the spell at a [Bonfire](/Bonfires "Dark Souls 2 Bonfires")
  3. Equip a [Staff](/Staves "Dark Souls 2 Staves"), [Chime](/Chimes "Dark Souls 2 Chimes"), or [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") to cast it. Staves for Sorceries, Chimes for Miracles, Flames for Pyromancies, and Chimes or Staves for Hexes.
  4. Many spells require that you aim, which can be perfected using binoculars.

###  Spices & Spell Requirements

Throughout the game, you may encounter Skeptic's Spice and Simpleton's Spice. These items can be used to reduce the required skill in Faith or Intelligence respectively. The Spice affects only one spell, but you can use multiple spices to lower requirements to a minimum of 10 intelligence or faith. Please see the linked pages for detailed information on spices.

    | / Acid Surge | Pyromancy | 2-5 | - | - | 1 | A fringe pyromancy of unknown origin. Sprays an equipment-eroding acid. / Does not directly damage foes, but eats away at their equipment instead. Yet another pyromancy inspired by perniciousness. |
    | / Lingering Flame | Pyromancy | 4-8 | - | - | 2 | One of the pyromancies devised by Straid, the great mage of Olaphis. Release a static fireball that explodes when foes draw near. / Straid was an oddly gifted mage, well-versed in both sorceries and pyromancies, but his curious temperament never allowed him to settle down in one place for very long. / (Casts a fireball that travels a short distance before floating in the air for 30 seconds, after which it dissipates. Explodes when close to an enemy.) |

    | / Flame Weapon | Pyromancy | 4-8 | - | - | 1 | Pyromancy that imbues weapon in other hand with fire. Adds fire damage to the types of damage the weapon already inflicts. Pyromancy and sorcery are said to be like oil and water, but in fact their origins can be traced to a common source. / Adds 50 fire damage and increases overall fire elemental power by 15%(1.06 reduced it from 30% so it could be 20%) for 90 seconds to equipped weapon. |
    | / Flash Sweat | Pyromancy | 4-8 | - | - | 1 | A pyromancy that internalizes the power of flame. Sweat profusely, reducing fire damage. / Most useful when facing other flame-manipulating pyromancers. Just don't take the looks you get personally. / Increase fire defense by 300 for 60 seconds. |
    | / Iron Flesh | Pyromancy | 2-4 | - | - | 1 | A pyromancy that internalizes the power of flame. Turns the body into iron, increasing defense and resistance. / As one might guess, the rock-solid flesh enabled by this spell dramatically slows movement. Guaranteed to cause trouble if used at an inopportune moment. / (Increases defense by 100, all resistances by 10%, poise by 100 but reduces movement speed. Lasts 20 seconds.) |
    | / Warmth | Pyromancy | 4-8 | - | - | 1 | One of the lost pyromancies preserved only in the Undead Crypt. Creates a gentle, warm flame that heals those who touch it. / Fire can be a show of strength, but it is also a symbol of wisdom and comfort. Fire is what the caster wishes it be. |
    | / Immolation | Pyromancy | 8-15 | - | - | 1 | A pyromancy that creates a coating of flame, allowing the caster to incinerate nearby foes. Needless to say, this is a perilous spell that burns the caster while active. (Lasts 30 seconds.) / If a person is truly desirous of something, perhaps being set on fire does not seem so bad. |
    | / Outcry | Pyromancy | 1-3 | - | - | 2 | A pyromancy of Nadalia, Bride of Ash. Spouts multiple Dark flames. / "This child of Dark, bearing inconceivable strength, found herself in a kingless land devoid of souls. And in journeying there, has all but condemned herself to a fate most wretched." |
    | / Dance of Fire | Pyromancy | 3-6 | - | - | 1 | Pyromancy created by the magus Eygil, loyal follower of the Old Iron King. Cast flame in a sweeping motion across a targeted area. "The fire seems to dance, and makes its victims dance with it." |
    | / Fire Snake | Pyromancy | 2-4 | - | - | 2 | Pyromancy created by the magus Eygil, loyal follower of the Old Iron King. / "Eygil sought to grant fire a will of its own. This pyromancy was conjured up to behave like a snake, writhing toward its prey, with a mind to strike." |
    | / Heal | Miracle | 3-6 | - | 12 | 1 | A healing miracle widely used by clerics. Slightly restores HP. (Heals caster and nearby allies for 500 HP.) / To use miracles, equip a sacred chime and attune a miracle at a bonfire. |
    | / Med Heal | Miracle | 2-4 | - | 18 | 1 | Superior spell to Heal. Restores HP. (Heals caster and nearby allies for 850 HP.) / The strength of miracles are influenced by one's faith. / Miracles are tales of the Gods passed down long ago, but only a small number of the original tomes remain in their entirety, and most that exist are restorations. |
    | / Great Heal Excerpt | Miracle | 1-3 | - | 14 | 1 | A highly advanced miracle. An excerpt from the Great Heal tome. Greatly restores HP. Its effect is the same as Great Heal, but has limited uses.
