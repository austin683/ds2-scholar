**Creighton's Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
_"A typical steel mask._  
_Belonged to Creighton the Wanderer._  
_Its design resembles that of the knight order_  
 _of the eastern land of Mirrah, but with some odd differences that catch the eye._  
_Perhaps it is a finely-crafted imitation."_

###  Set Location

  * Mask is dropped by [Creighton the Wanderer](/Creighton+the+Wanderer) or received from [Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Pate") if you decide to go against Creighton in their fight.
  * Chestpiece and leggings (but not gloves) are sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia) (11,3k) once Creighton's killed either by Pate's hand or yours.
  * The entire set is obtained by helping Creighton in their fight with Pate.
  * The family crest is the same as on [Benhart's Set](/Benhart%27s+Set), so it's likely belonged to the knight order in Mirrah. Note that this is a replica, while Benhart found the true armor in Mirrah.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite).
  * Chestpiece offers the highest bleed resistance.
