_"Armor/Leggings worn by Sir Alonne, who served the Old Iron King_   
_Sir Alonne came to this land from the east, chose to serve a little-known and unestablished lord, and helped him become the Old Iron King._   
_Then, at the very peak of his sire's rule, Sir Alonne set out again, in search of lands yet unknown."_

###  Set Location

  * Sold by [Magerold of Lanafir](/Magerold+of+Lanafir "Dark Souls 2 Magerold of Lanafir") (74,4k) in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") once [Sir Alonne](/Sir+Alonne "Dark Souls 2 Sir Alonne") is defeated.
  * A random piece can also drop from Sir Alonne (it seems this only happens if you are a phantom).

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Upgraded physical defenses are only 25% higher.
  * Resembles the Eastern Armor worn by _Shiva of the East_ in  _Dark Souls_.
  * Extremely light.
