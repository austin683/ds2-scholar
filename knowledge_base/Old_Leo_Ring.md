### Dark Souls 2 Old Leo Ring Effects

**Durability** : -

**Weight** :

  * 0.5

**Effect:**

  * Boosts [Counter Modifier](/Counter+Damage "Dark Souls 2 Counter Damage") of **thrust** attacks by 12.5%.
  * For example: If a weapon has a Counter Modifier of 160, the effective counter modifier will be   
160 * 1.125 = 180, and thrust counter attacks will deal 180% times as much damage as regular thrust attacks.
  * This even applies to weapons that normally don't deal counter damage. This is because they have a Counter Modifier   
of 100, and with the ring the Counter Modifier becomes 112.5 for thrust attacks.

### Old Leo Ring Locations in Dark Souls 2

  * Obtained by defeating the [Old Dragonslayer](/Old+Dragonslayer "Dark Souls 2 Old Dragonslayer") boss in the [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue").

### DS2 Old Leo Ring Tips and Notes

  * Because the effect is multiplicative, this ring is most effective on weapons that already have very high counter modifiers.
  * The Old Leo Ring also boosts damage of [Bows](/Bows "Dark Souls 2 Bows"), [Crossbows](/Crossbows "Dark Souls 2 Crossbows") and [Greatbows](/Greatbows "Dark Souls 2 Greatbows") [Counter Damage](/Counter+Damage "Dark Souls 2 Counter Damage").
  * Strengthens counter of all thrust-type attacks regardless of the actual weapon equipped (thus affects thrusting moves of any weapon and even arrows).
  * [Counter Damage](/Counter+Damage "Dark Souls 2 Counter Damage") not only benefits from physical damage, but is also affected by elementally infused weapons.
  * Does NOT affect ripostes and backstabs. They are not counter attacks and use different damage calculations.
