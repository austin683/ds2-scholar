*When infused: 243 physical dmg/126 elemental dmg and B scaling with chosen element. Str scaling changes to E. Dex scaling changes to B. 

**Scythe of the Forlorn** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**.

> _Scythe of the Forlorn,_ _who wander the land of the Undead._   
>   
>  _The King's elder brother Aldia sought to overcome the curse through means unalike his sibling's._   
>   
>  _The Forlorn were born of Aldia's sinful infatuation._

### Acquired From

  * Purchased from [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis") for 7500 souls.
  * This weapon is a [Scholar of the First Sin](/Dark+Souls+II+Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin") exclusive for Ps4, Xbox1 & DX11

### Scythe of the Forlorn Hints and Tips:

  * Scales with [Hollowing](/Hollowing "Dark Souls 2 Hollowing") just like the [dark pyromancy flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame"). Must be fully hollowed for its full damage.
  * Can be weapon buffed.
  * Upgraded with Twinkling Titanite to +5.
  * This weapon, like the [Greatsword of the Forlorn](/Greatsword+of+the+Forlorn "Dark Souls 2 Greatsword of the Forlorn"), performs best when infused with bleed. It gets an incredible amount of bleed damage and loses only a tiny amount of normal/dark damage. The dark scaling is also BETTER than when you infuse it with dark.
