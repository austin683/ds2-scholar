##  Dark Souls 2 Official Website

Developed by From Software, Dark Souls 2 is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Dark Souls, an action RPG with estimated sales of over 1.5 million units. The original game's appeal lay in its renowned difficulty and trial-and-error approach, one that Dark Souls 2 promises to sustain.   
As of the 24th of March, 100 million souls have died on PS3, and 35 million souls have died on Xbox 360.   
  
  
**Regarding The Software**   
  

  * The game is not a direct sequel to Dark Souls.
  * As the game's protagonist, the players will embark on a journey to remove from themselves the affliction of a curse.
  * Bonfires and covenants return, as do gestures.
  * The difficulty level will remain, with the focus staying on learning from death to overcome challenges. The variety of ways to die has been prioritized but the focus is still on fairness.
  * The story is presented in the same fashion as Demon's and Dark, unobtrusive and discoverable by players who wish to dig deeper.
  * A new graphics engine was created to address frame-rate issues and give the development team an extra tool for creating atmosphere. PC will run at 60 fps and Console versions will run at 30 fps.

## Everything we know about Dark Souls II

### What is Dark Souls II

Dark Souls 2 is the second installment in the Dark Souls series by FromSoftware but is not a direct sequel to Dark Souls. It is a highly acclaimed action role-playing game that has developed a loyal fanbase and still continues to garner large audiences and a loyal player base as FromSoftware continues to release Souls action role-playing games such as Elden Ring. Dark Souls was released back in March 2014 and was first made available on multiple console platforms followed by a release for Windows. 

The Souls games are most famous for their challenging combat encounters, forcing players to craft a strategy in the game that best suits them and the battle itself. The souls games are known for their many features to consider when creating a build to suit each combat encounter. Choosing appropriate gear, or applying the wrong strategy against certain Enemies and Bosses will have great consequences in Dark Souls 2, but like previous games, this title has a cooperative feature that allows aid from other players. Dark Souls 2 multiplayer modes allow players to be summoned to cooperate in boss battles and offers PvP invasions as well. Many of these features are returning features that are found in previous titles of the Dark Souls series and can still be found in From Software's recent releases. 

### Dark Souls II Features

Dark Souls II is released with some returning features from the Dark Souls series and some new improved features that allow for better graphics and improved experiences. Below are some Key Features from their official website. 

  * **Go Beyond Death** : dare yourself to engage against intense gameplay in a vast world powered by an all-new engine that leaps graphics, sound & FX forward like never before
  * **A labyrinth of monsters & bosses**: immerse yourself into mind-bending environments filled with new twisted monsters and deadly bosses that could only come from the imagination of FROM SOFTWARE
  * **Sensory assault** : a wide range of threats will prey on human senses & phobias - auditory hallucinations, vertigo, acrophobia, etc
  * **Deeper and darker** : more intricate customization options provide weapons and armor tailoring to player style
  * **Evolved multiplayer** : updated multiplayer system enables improved online interaction to bring forward cooperative & competitive play
  * **Refined gameplay** : DARK SOULS™ II features fluid motion-capture animations, an upgraded combat system, a vastly expanded suite of characters, deeper customization options, new weapons, armor abilities, and a balanced player progression system

#### Story and Setting for Dark Souls 2 

Not much is revealed about the game's story and lore before entering the game. Dark Souls 2 was made to be explored and uncovered with progress and exploration. To understand the story, players must engage in dialogue with different characters in the game, and pay attention to item descriptions, and geographic clues. These will allude to the history of the lands and will slowly take players through the Age of Fire and then the Age of Dark through in-game storytelling. 

Prologue  
"Perhaps you've seen it, maybe in a dream. A murky, forgotten land...  
A place where souls may mend your ailing mind.  
You will lose everything, once branded. The symbol of the curse, an augur of darkness. Your past, your future, your very light.  
None will have meaning, and you won't even care. By then, you will be something other than human. A thing that feeds on souls, a hollow.  
Long ago, in a walled-off land far to the north. A great king built a great kingdom. I believe they called it Drangleic. Perhaps you're familiar. No, how could you be... But one day, you will stand before its decrepit gate, without really knowing why.  
Like a moth drawn to a flame, your wings will burn in anguish. Time, after time.  
For that is your fate. The fate of the cursed."

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/dragon-cinematic-homepage-dark-souls-2-wiki-guide-1920px-min.jpg)[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/cinematic-homepage-dark-souls-2-wiki-guide-1920px-min.jpg)[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/castle-cinematic-homepage-dark-souls-2-wiki-guide-1920px-min.jpg)

Dark Souls II centers around the Bearer of the Curse who must venture to the Kingdom of Drangleic to obtain four Great Souls from Old ones found around the lands as instructed by Emerald Herald. He eventually encounters Queen Nashandra who tells the story of the King who abandoned his duties and must be slain. 

Unravel the [Lore](/Lore "Dark Souls 2 Lore") of the game and find out the origins of the curse as you progress and speak to the [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") encountered in the game. A breakdown of the full story, background, and ending explanations can be viewed on [Lore](/Lore "Dark Souls 2 Lore").

## Unique Gameplay Mechanics in Dark Souls 2

### What Classes are in Dark Souls 2?

**Dark Souls II** has 8 different Starting [Classes](/Classes "Dark Souls 2 Classes") to choose from. [Classes](/Classes "Dark Souls 2 Classes") are one of the main features of Character Customization and creating a build in Dark Souls 2. The Starting Class determines the player's initial stats, but each character can still be built to have other class strengths depending on how players prefer to progress or upgrade their characters. Abilities are also shared amongst the classes which give players the flexibility to modify their builds according to their playstyles even after choosing a Class. 

  * [Warrior](/Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Warrior"): Battle-scarred warrior. High strength, and dexterity. Skilled with weapons.
  * [Knight](/Knight "Dark Souls 2 Knight") Traveling knight. High HP and adaptability. Tough to take down.
  * [Swordsman](/Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Swordsman"): Finely skilled swordsman. Fights gracefully with strong weapons in both hands.
  * [Bandit](/Bandit "Dark Souls 2 Bandit"): A merciless outlaw. High dexterity, skilled with a bow; Fights well at various ranges.
  * [Cleric](/Cleric "Dark Souls 2 Cleric"): A Cleric on a pilgrimage. High faith and miracles guide the way.
  * [Sorcerer](/Sorcerer "Dark Souls 2 Sorcerer"): Knowledgeable sorcerer. Casts sorceries with high intelligence and attunement.
  * [Explorer](/Explorer "Dark Souls 2 Explorer"): Well-traveled explorer. Not terribly powerful, but has many items.

### DS2 Difficulties

In **Dark Souls 2** , there are no options to toggle different difficulty levels. There is only one Difficulty in Dark Souls 2. FromSoftware has considered all aspects of this game including new players of Souls games as well as veteran players. Being a vast world, all types of players and playstyles can be used to approach this game with one difficulty level. The developers created a world with multiple points of interest that were not always designed to be conquered when encountered. Progressing through some optional areas means that any area that has not been completed due to level or skill restraints at the time of the encounter can be returned to at a later time. Players can then decide to complete other areas, upgrade their build, gain better equipment and skills before returning to any uncomplete area, or find help through cooperative play from the community. Souls games are known for their challenging combat encounters, and they continue to hold their distinct challenging characteristics by removing the option of Easy mode. Players who seek greater difficulties always have the option to challenge themselves by imposing limitations on themselves when completing a playthrough such as limiting themselves to lower level equipment or refusing to spawn farm throughout a playthrough. 

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/boss-gameplay-homepage-dark-souls-2-wiki-guide-1920px-min.jpg)

### What are Covenants in Dark Souls II?

**Dark Souls 2** [Covenants](/Covenants "Dark Souls 2 Covenants") act like factions that can benefit players as they interact with different [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") and progress in the game. These are made by encountering and then engaging specific NPCs and pledging loyalties to them by making oaths. This will then bind you to them and the specific NPCs conditions and guidelines. Abiding by these covenant guidelines will grant players rewards for their loyalty, however, breaking them will also have consequences. At any time, players may choose to abandon their current covenant by seeking out [Sweet Shalquoir](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir"), a cat [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") in a small building near the large hole in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). You may also abandon your covenant by attempting to join a new one. There are no kinds of punishment for abandoning a covenant and you're able to rejoin whenever you want. 

This feature can be accessed early in the game and may be chosen depending on your focus preference, with 9 Covenants in total. These range from Co-op, Invading/ Summoned PvP, and PVE Covenant types. Each Covenant will have a different goal and task to achieve their goals through multiplayer interaction. Below are the Covenant types and all 9 Covenants.

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/dark-souls-2-screen-shot-17.jpg)

### Bonfires in DS2

[Bonfires](/Bonfires "Dark Souls 2 Bonfires") act like checkpoints and pitstops in Dark Souls 2. They can be found and unlocked throughout each location in order to allow players to rest, and replenish health and estus. These will also be the starting points where players will respawn after death. Players appear at the last bonfire they rested at. Once players reach a bonfire, they are able to modify or fix some items or magic.

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/bonfire-homepage-dark-souls-2-wiki-guide-600px-min.jpg)

Rest at a bonfire to access the bonfire menu which will prompt you with a few options: Travel, Attune spells, Burn, and access the Item box. Burning [Items](/Items "Dark Souls 2 Items") at a Bonfire may grant additional effects to that item. Here, players can also access their item box to deposit items or travel to specific Bonfires that have been unlocked on the map. Speak to the Queen in Drangleic Castle and you will be able to view these bonfires from your menu. Unkindled or unlocked bonfires will be marked with a question mark.

## Combat in Dark Souls II

### Lock-On DS2

Is the ability to lock-on to targets This provides a target focus when prioritizing certain enemies. However, this does not mean damage output is automatically aimed towards the locked target. This is one of the main features players will frequently be using when entering [Boss](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses") encounters and arenas. In a fight with multiple opponents, this allows players to prioritize clearing specific opponents in the area. This feature mostly affects the camera focus and framing of the encounter, but will allow the character to move more freely during lock-on, and is, able to roll and run away from the target while remaining locked on, whereas in the previous game lock-on would always make the player face the target.

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/lock-on-homepage-dark-souls-2-wiki-guide-600px-min.jpg)

### Stats & Attributes DS2

[Stats](/Stats "Dark Souls 2 Stats") in **DS2** are the main measurements of combat effectiveness in the game. Players and enemies will have their own set of stats and strengths. Different Weapons, Armor, and equipment may affect these stats while equipped and certain Items may temporarily grant effects that will affect these stat numbers as well. 

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/stats-homepage-dark-souls-2-wiki-guide-600px-min.jpg)

As players progress and engage in combat, they may earn attribute points which increase the player's stats and strength in combat. This will have a numerical value that players can track. It is important to know what your current stats are in order to determine what equipment your character is able to equip. Stats found in Dark Souls II are as follows.

This stamina regeneration speed can be affected by items the player can use. Firstly, the Slumbering Dragon Shield, Blossom Kite Shield, and Shield of the Insolent give a bonus of 5% stamina regeneration speed. Meanwhile, Green Blossoms give 15% additional stamina recovery. Lastly, the Chloranthy Ring gives bonuses of 12.5%, 20%, and 25% at +0, +1, and +2 respectively. All stamina regeneration items can be applied at the same time (stacked).
