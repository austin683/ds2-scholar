### DKS2 Spider Fang Acquired From

  * Trade [Soul of the Duke's Dear Freja](/Soul+of+the+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 Soul of the Duke%27s Dear Freja") to [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex") for 1500 souls.

### Spider Fang Hints and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * The Spider Fang's heavy attack has quite the range. With a little aim it is easy to hit distant enemies.
  * Does not shoot web if wielded in left hand, replaced by either parrying or power stance heavy attack.
  * However, if you two-hand the sword while equipped in left hand, heavy attack will be replaced by a faster thrust which still shoots web.
  * The special attack is great for catching people off guard in PVP, especially backstab hunters, making them an easy kill.
