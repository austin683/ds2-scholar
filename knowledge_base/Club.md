**Club** is a **[Hammer](/Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Hammers")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). ****Club** can be bought from [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") for 800 souls. This hammer can be upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") and is not compatible with Bleed infusion. It is a robust choice for strength builds. While larger Clubs may offer more power overall, the basic club's early availability, before facing any bosses, makes it an attractive option for a strength-based PVE build.

### How to get Club in Dark Souls 2

  * Dropped by club-wielding [Rogues](/Rogue "Dark Souls 2 Rogue") in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse")

### DS2 Club Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite"). Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * While at first glance the basic club may seem like a joke weapon, it is actually an extremely powerful choice for strength builds.
  * While the large or great clubs might be better choices in general, the basic club is available before you fight any bosses, making it a very attractive choice for a STR-based PVE build.
  * Has moves from Axes, making it faster then other hammers.
