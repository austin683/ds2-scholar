### DS2 Greatsword of the Forlorn Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5.
  * Scales with [Hollowing](/Hollowing "Dark Souls 2 Hollowing") just like the [dark pyromancy flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame"). Must be fully hollowed for its full damage.
  * The last item unlocked from Straid after the NPC invader "[Forlorn](/Forlorn "Dark Souls 2 Forlorn")" with a greatsword is defeated after already having defeated them 4 or more times.
  * It would appear that "Bleed" is the best upgrade path due to higher Dark scaling, higher base damage, and paired with it's natural bleed effect.
