**Vessel Shield** is a [standard shield](/standard+shields "Dark Souls 2 standard shields") in Dark Souls 2. **DLC** or Downloadable Content shields cannot be obtained in the original version of the game, Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Shield depicting a priestess of Eleum Loyce._

     _Emanates a certain heat that heightens the abilities of its bearer._

     _The priestesses, who devoted themselves to appeasing the ancient flame, are no longer."_
