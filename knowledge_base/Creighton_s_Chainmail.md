**Creighton's Chainmail** is a [Chest Piece](/Chest+Pieces "Dark Souls 2 Chest Pieces") in Dark Souls 2.

_"Atypical chainmail.__Belonged to Creighton the Wanderer._

_Its design resembles that of the knight order of the eastern land of Mirrah, but with some odd differences that catch the eye.__Perhaps it is a finely-crafted imitation.__"_

### Location

  * Chest, Gloves, Legs from [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia").
  * You can also obtain his entire armor set by helping him during his fight with [Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate").
  * The family crest is same as [Benhart's Set](/Benhart%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Benhart%27s Set"), it's belonged to the knight order in Mirrah, note that this is a replica, while Benhart found the true armor in Mirrah, this explained the origin of Benhart's armor.

### Creighton's Chainmail Notes

  * Part of the [Creighton's Set](/Creighton's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Creighton's Set").
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab").
