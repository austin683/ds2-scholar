**Archdrake Boots** is a **legging** and a part of [Archdrake Set](/Archdrake+Set "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Set") in Dark Souls 2.

### Archdrake Boots Description 

_"Leggings worn by the Archdrake sect of Lindelt.  
Though little is actually known about the order, it is said their well-honed miracles and unwavering faith in the face of death made them worthy rivals to Drangleic's forces in their day."   
  
Scholar of the First Sin changed to:   
"Little is known about the Archdrake sect and its ancient rituals, and those who dare to indulge their curiosity have been known to simply vanish.   
The Archdrake sect are the keepers of Lindelt's histories, including the only record of its foundation, a tome they have good reason to keep hidden away."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Pieces of the armor are dropped by enemies in the [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana").
  * The Archdrake Robes are located at the Lost Bastille. Near the location where you receive the [Wanderer set](/Wanderer+Set "Dark Souls 2 Wanderer Set"), there is a building near it. Next to a wall are explosive barrels. Detonate them to reveal a hidden room containing the robes and an [Archdrake Shield](/Archdrake+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Archdrake Shield").

### Archdrake Boots Notes

  * Upgraded with normal [Titanite](/titanite "Dark Souls 2 titanite").
  * The helm increases intelligence by one point.
  * Originally it was named the Dragonknight Set and the Archdrake sect of Lindelt was named Silverdrake Knights of Lindelt.
