### How to Access Brume Tower / Crown of the Old Iron King DLC

**In Scholar of the First Sin (SotFS):** The Heavy Iron Key is no longer given automatically. Find it on a skeleton in the pit with the Flame Lizards in the **Forest of Fallen Giants**. Then travel to the **Iron Keep**, go to the primal bonfire chamber, and examine the obelisk to be teleported. Use the Heavy Iron Key to open the locked door and enter **Brume Tower**.

**In vanilla Dark Souls 2:** The Heavy Iron Key is added to your inventory when you purchase the DLC. Go to the primal bonfire chamber in Iron Keep and examine the obelisk, then use the key to enter.
