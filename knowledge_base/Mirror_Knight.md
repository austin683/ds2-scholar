### Looking Glass Knight Information 

**Looking Glass Knight** is a boss in Dark Souls 2. Formerly known as the Mirror Knight, this knight is clad in steel polished to a mirror finish. It wields a mirror shield which it can use to summon NPCs and players to fight against the player during the boss fight, as well as deflect spells that come in contact with the mirror. Real players may also be summoned to fight for the Looking Glass Knight, scroll to the bottom of this page to read details.

### Location

  * [Looking Glass Knight Soul](/Looking+Glass+Knight+Soul)
  * [Ring of Steel Protection +2 (ng+)](/Ring+of+Steel+Protection)

### Attacks
    
    
    |  | Description | Counter Measures |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Shield Bash | Uses the tower shield strong attack, except it's a lot slower than a player's animation. |  |
    | Lightning Spin | Charges his sword and then does a spin. |  |
    | Lightning Cone | Charges his sword and attempts to hit his target - several, maybe 8 lightning balls will fly out from this location - so be sure to avoid that general direction. | Can roll to left or right to avoid them if you cannot avoid general direction. |
    | Lightning Beam | Charges his sword, then points it at his target, firing a laser-like lightning bolt for about 3-4 seconds. Deals medium amounts of damage and will knock the target down if not blocking and will stun-lock if blocking. |  |
    | Summon | Slams shield on to the ground facing forward, in an attempt to summon an NPC or invader to help the Looking Glass Knight. | Can be stopped by breaking his poise and staggering him. / Can be forced to summon NPC's by burning a Human Effigy |
    | Jump Slash | Crouches, then jumps forward at his target to perform an overhead downwards slash. Will change direction or shorten the length of jump in midair to accommodate for target's movement (i.e. rolling towards him, rolling to the side). |  |
    

### NPC Summons

[Benhart of Jugo](/Benhart+of+Jugo) can be summoned for this encounter, provided the player has spoken to him outside the [Old Akelarre](/Old+Akelarre) before the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods) and inside [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle). His summon sign is located just before the fog gate and to the left.   
In The Scholar of the First Sin Edition, it is possible to summon [Ashen Knight Boyd](/Ashen+Knight+Boyd) for this fight.

### Strategy

His attacks can be easily avoided as they tend to be very slow and fairly predictable, whenever he uses his lightning attacks simply stand behind him and take the opportunity to attack him. Make sure to eliminate any summoned players as soon as possible as they can make the fight far more difficult. Note that attacks on his left (his shield arm) might bounce for melee weapons even if he is not actively guarding so stick on his right (your left) if you plan to land multiple strikes.   
By staying close behind the shoulder of its weapon arm it is possible to avoid most of its attacks without the need for your shield or rolling though will require you to pay close attention to his attack movements. The advantage of this strategy is that you will remain behind him ready to attack as he recovers. When it charges its lightning attack by staying as close as possible to the back shoulder of its shield arm instead when it unleashes its attack it is likely to miss you or at least cause minimal damage.   
Be warned the greatest threat is not the boss itself but the phantoms summoned from its shield. NPC phantoms carry a surprising amount of health and can cause a nuisance to distract you from the boss; human players, on the other hand, can be potentially competent PVP players capable of killing you far more easily than the boss itself. Note: It is possible to stagger him when he's trying to summon another NPC (Summoning players cannot be interrupted), I tried this using my [great club](/Great+Club) +6 and constantly hitting him while he's trying to summon. It took me **7** heavy hits (R2 if you're using Xbox controller) - **4** hits to get him to 50% health and **3** hits during his summon animation - to stagger him. After being staggered, he won't try to summon anymore. Killing the boss will banish any phantoms he has summoned.   
WARNING: This boss deals very high amounts of damage with one sword swing, and always homes his target even after starting a combo or even a swing. He can easily insta-kill you if you are at medium health. Wearing the [Ring of Binding](/Ring+of+Binding) is highly recommended to keep your maximum health from dropping too low. Fortunately, he has slow combos with large amounts of time between, giving you some breathing room and space to heal. When he does his Jump Slam attack, your best bet is either to backstep a few times, roll to the side or to the front at the LAST SECOND (any other time won't work), or block. Keep in mind that blocking this attack will most likely stun-lock you.   
Eating a [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom) is helpful before the fight because dodging and blocking his attacks is a big stamina drainer.

**To sum up the fight in a type of playbook, it goes like this:**

  1. The Knight may open up the boss fight with a jumping lunge attack. Like all of his other attacks, i-framing is more precise than other bosses because of the awkward speed of the attack, so roll to his back and get in 1-2 hits.
  2. He is weak to flanking, so sprinting to his back is very potent, but don't get greedy, and don't spam, because he attacks often.
  3. Most of his attacks come out of the front of him. Be wary of rogue hitboxes. I personally did not encounter any of these, because I haven't fought him that much, however, I have beaten him.
  4. When he moves to summon, use the opportunity to hit his back, but don't let your stamina gauge deplete. If he summons an NPC, it will not be that aggressive, and you can play the fight like the Belfry Gargoyles, or Ruin Sentinels, and just wait out the group aggression, to get in some hits. NPC summons by the Knight disappear, so 
  5. This is a fight of patience, so be ready for fake opportunities, where the Knight and/or his summon can interrupt you, while you are trying to attack the Knight. 
  6. If you keep getting a real player summon instead of an NPC summon, it makes sense to play the fight in a much more slow-paced and patient way.

### Hints

  * The boss can summon an NPC or an **invader** out the boss area.*
  * His opening move is a large jump/lunge at you with his huge sword. You can run right at him and roll under him to easily dodge.
  * Be careful not to get stuck between him, the wall, and his massive shield.
  * Physical attacks did not work well for me, but physical attacks with magic imbued weapons did, as well as magic attacks. The best one was 'Lightning Spear'. When he is focusing on your summoned partner lock on from just far away and unload on him.
  * Strike weapons can be very effective against this boss.
  * His glass shield can be broken if you land enough damage and prevent him from doing the summoning.
  * Standing close to the front of the shield while an enemy is being summoned will let you kill the enemy quickly when it spawns before the mirror knight has a chance to react.
  * Summoning a phantom for this fight **_GREATLY_** reduces the difficulty of this boss. He will lock on to one player and sluggishly try and hit them - if the targeted player is at least semi-competent then he/she'll be able to kite him and guard against his attacks, while the other player(s) go ham sandwich on him.
  * Most projectile spells (like soul arrow and lightning spear, unlike flame swathe and dark storm) hitting the mirror have a chance to deflect. Sadly reflected projectiles are purely visual and can't hit on their way back, even if the projectile goes right through its original caster. (Just wanted to say now I feel silly for being a bit shaken after a Great Resonant Soul bounced back very close to my head)
  * After using all four resins on him it turns out lightning is the one that does the most damage.
  * Avoid attacking his shield unless he's summoning because the recoil will stun you long enough for him to swipe you or even combo you to death.
  * Use a 100% Damage reduction shield as well as the Clerics Shield for his lightning attacks and you'll never get hurt.
  * Casting Dark Fog a few times kills him while all you need to do is run around killing his NPCs
  * Should you wish to enter the Looking Glass Knight boss fight and guarantee another player will not join (likely due to the fact that the NPCs are simply easier to deal with), killing the stone guardians and golden knight in front of the fog gate will prevent the Looking Glass Knight from summoning other players. Only NPCs will be summoned. It could be suggested that the stone guardians and the golden knight are the ones who touch the summon signs for the Looking Glass Knight. _This has yet to be tested extensively. I killed all five of the enemies in the hall on two separate attempts at the boss, and each time another player was not summoned with the enemies dead. When the enemies were alive, another player was summoned. Also skeptical, I've cleared this boss 10+ times without killing the mobs and have never had a player. This is likely random.(Killed all of the enemies leading to his room and he still summoned a player.)_

####  Bugs

  * His Lightning Spin/Cone/Beam and Summon's sound effects will happen even if you have everything muted. They are also unaffected by the sound effects volume slider. To make the lightning's volume match the rest of the game, set the sound effects slider to 50% and adjust the game sound using either your TV's volume or the Windows volume mixer.
  * One of his attacks may continuously push you in a direction until blocked by the wall, preventing you to move at all. Attacking a nd rolling/dodging still works, but you'll stay in place.
  * Summoned phantoms may be invisible to invaders

* * *

####  Be Summoned by the Looking Glass Knight

It is possible to be summoned by the Looking Glass Knight through its shield as another player fights the boss.   
  
  
To do this, place a [Red Sign Soapstone](/Red+Sign+Soapstone) _anywhere_ in the castle in one of the areas around the 2 last bonfires and in time you will be summoned. You are more likely to be summoned if you replace your sign every ten seconds or so, rather than leaving it alone on the ground. This also minimizes your chances of being summoned by a player. You don't have to place it in King's Passage.   
Tested thoroughly, you don't need to be near a mirror or in any specific area. Replacing your sign ever 5 to 10 seconds works great, all my summons were within the first 5 seconds.   
  
  
It is also possible to get summoned by the Looking Glass Knight by using a cracked red eye orb.

  * **When you get summoned :** you get the time to see 2 loading screens (usually just 1 for normal invasions), during this time you can't do or see anything (that's a pretty big problem) but you can hear the sounds of the invaded world, try to use this information to count them (as it can be a player alone, but it can also be a player and 2 experienced phantoms helping him, etc.), and to know if there are any spell spammers (that will most likely rush you down with soul spears/sunlight spears / resonant souls).

  * You get spawned shortly after the end of the summoning sound the boss makes, at that time you can finally see around you, but your invincibility also ended, so start by running and/or rolling to give you some time to analyze the situation.

  * If 2-3 of them are trying to kill you, try to gain time and to use the boss to deflect projectiles (he does have a nice shield, don't forget !), while you focus on dodging everything. Eventually, they'll miss a dodge and the boss will do massive damage to them, OR you could even live long enough to see another friend summoned by the boss! Or they lose patience with you and you strike back.

  * As a summoned Mirror Squire, you may restore portions of the Looking Glass Knight's health with any healing spell, such as Warmth or Great Heal. The Knight will not react to these spells, but it will be healed as long as it remains close enough to the caster.

  * **From the invaded player point of view:** he and his phantoms get a special message like "Crown 0f Thorns mirror squire has summoned" only if a REAL player is on the way to get summoned. So he already knows you are a real player, and you should, as an invader, expect him and his allies to rush you down.
