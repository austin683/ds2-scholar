_"Boots worn by merchants from Lanafir, where blue represents knowledge. Wearing this increases item discovery.  
Lanafir is the farthest land to the south and follows a strict edict of isolationism. The rare visitor from Lanafir is always a little odd.""_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") by the Cardinal Tower bonfire in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"), or in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") when dialogue is exhausted

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades#Ore").
  * Hat raises item discovery when worn.*edit* Note: The hat raises item discovery by a CONSIDERABLE amount, this hat is definitely worth using all-game,whilst getting the defensive stats you need from other pieces.
