**Black Dragon Warpick** is a **[Hammer](/Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Hammers")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. **Black Dragon Warpick** boasts high base damage, but no scaling, making raw infusions recommended. Upgrading it to +5 requires Petrified Dragon Bone. It cannot be infused with Bleed and shares a moveset with the [Mace](/Mace "Dark Souls 2 Mace"). The drop rate is low, and wearing gear that boosts Discovery can increase chances of obtaining it.

> _In legend, this oddly-shaped war hammer_ _is said to be forged from the black dragon's tail._   
>   
>  _As it is told, the black dragon lost its tail to_ _a brave warrior in a magnificent battle,_ _and the tail was later used to forge_ _several legendary weapons._

### How to get Black Dragon Warpick in Dark Souls 2

  * Drops from Warpick [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight") in [Dragon shrine](/Dragon+shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon shrine"). (The golden-armored dragon humanoids). Only 3 Dragon Knights are present in the area, and only one wields this weapon. As such, it may take some grinding to acquire.
  * In SotFS, one of the first two [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight") in the Dragon Shrine wields this warpick, but the Dragon Knight in the tower wielding a large bow also drops this.

### DS2 Black Dragon Warpick Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5. 
  * Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * This weapon shares a moveset with the [Mace](/Mace "Dark Souls 2 Mace").
  * As with other dragon weapons, the Warpick boasts high base damage, but no scaling, so raw infusions are recommended.
  * The drop rate is very low, and it is recommended that the player kills the accompanying pick-less [Dragon Knight](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight") 12 times before farming, so the player can use a [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin") to farm the knight 3 times, as it is much harder to fight two Dragon Knights at once. It is wise to kill the two [Drakekeepers](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper") that are on the way to the tower 12 times each before farming as well. And of course, the player will save time by wearing all gear that boosts [Discovery](/Item+Discovery "Dark Souls 2 Item Discovery").
