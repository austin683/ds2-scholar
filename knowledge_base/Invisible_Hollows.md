**Invisible Hollows** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a new type of **[Secret](/Secrets "Dark Souls 2 Secrets")** that was introduced in the [Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin](/Dark+Souls+II+Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin") Edition. They become visible upon approaching them with a torch. When attacked they become visible, taking the form of a naked hollow enemy, and randomly drop something within a specific loot table. Sometimes their Shadows can still be seen even before they are revealed. Currently, it appears that at the very least, there's one in most areas, though all have yet to be discovered. They do not respawn upon being killed.

  * Note: Wearing any piece of the Moon Butterfly set can be extremely helpful as the poison procs when near and thus finding them much easier. I have already discovered 2 more hollows not mentioned anywhere this way.
