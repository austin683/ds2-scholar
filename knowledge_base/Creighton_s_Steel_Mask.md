_"__Atypical steel mask.__Belonged to Creighton the Wanderer._

_Its design resembles that of the knight order of the eastern land of Mirrah, but with some odd differences that catch the eye.__Perhaps it is a finely-crafted imitation.__"_

### Location

  * Helm from killing [Creighton the Wanderer](/Creighton+the+Wanderer "Dark Souls 2 Creighton the Wanderer")
  * You can also obtain his entire armor set by helping him during the fight with [Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate").
  * The family crest is same as [Benhart's Set](/Benhart%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Benhart%27s Set"), it belonged to the knight order in **Mirrah**. 
    * Note that this is a replica, while Benhart found the true armor in Mirrah, this explained the origin of [Benhart's](/Benhart%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Benhart%27s Set") armor.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Creighton's Set](/Creighton's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Creighton's Set").
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite+SHard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite SHard").
