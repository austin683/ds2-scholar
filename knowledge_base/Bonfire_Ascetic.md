**Bonfire Ascetic** is a type of consumable in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)** and Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin. Exercise caution before employing this hazardous ember. Fire shares a link with the curse, and as the flames surge, so does the curse. [Consumable Items](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") grant various effects such as restorative properties for recovering HP, removing certain negative status effects, applying temporary buffs and debuffs, as well as activating various actions and effects.

### Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic Usage

  * When resting at a Bonfire, select "Burn" and then select "Bonfire Ascetic". Burning a Bonfire Ascetic is irreversible, so exercise caution.
  * Doing so will increase the Intensity of the bonfire by one tier each time an ascetic is burned. This can be verified on the Travel menu when highlighting the specific bonfire.
  * This effectively makes the area affected by the bonfire go into a higher ng cycle (so bonfire intensity 1 is base ng, intensity 2 is ng+, intensity 3 is ng++, etc.). 

### Bonfire Ascetic Important Notes in Dark Souls 2

  * You need to first kill the area boss(es) to burn the Ascetic in **any** of the bonfires in that area. Otherwise, you will get a message saying "First, defeat the lord of this quarter" and you will not be able to burn the Ascetic.
  * Please be aware that any ascetic you burn in a bonfire WILL carry on to the next playthrough! If you want to farm souls and/or farm items using ascetics and then wish to go to NG+, the difficulty of the area will be the number of ascetics used + the NG cycle you're currently at. If you use a Bonfire Ascetic on your first playthrough on a bonfire, it will be NG+ level, so when you go to your second playthrough it will stack and will become NG++, and so on. Be very careful as this may make it much harder for you to complete the areas where you burned an ascetic.
  * Using a Bonfire Ascetic will NOT respawn Estus Flask Shards, and will NOT respawn NPCs.
  * Using a Bonfire Ascetic **will NOT respawn Metal Chests** , but will respawn _Wooden Chests_ and items laying on the ground or on corpses. Increasing the intensity also allows the player to be able to obtain items that exclusively appear in NG+ and NG++. Useful for farming certain items.
  * Using a Bonfire Ascetic **will** respawn enemies that have been unpetrified (with [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore")), but you **will not** need to unpetrify them again. They'll respawn unpetrified and ready to be killed.
  * Bonfire intensity caps at 99, but you can still burn ascetics past 99 to respawn the boss or farm loot.

  * The difficulty caps at NG+7, so every successive burning after the 8th intensity will be of the same difficulty. The highest leap in difficulty is from NG to NG+, after which the enemies slowly become stronger up to NG+7.
  * Burning the item is also a way to respawn exhausted enemies, albeit at a much higher difficulty. 
    * Alternatively, if the player is on the SotFS edition, they can join the Covenant of Champions to make enemies respawn without having to burn an ascetic.
  * If the bonfire ascetic is used in the Heide's ruin bonfire, you will be able to farm sublime bone dust of the knight that doesn't respawn but you will need to defeat the [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider") each time. (Only in non-SOFTS version)
  * For details on the results of burning an ascetic at each bonfire, please visit the individual bonfire's page. A full list of the game's bonfires can be found on the [Bonfires](/Bonfires "Dark Souls 2 Bonfires") page.
  * Beating a boss when 8 ascetics have been used on its bonfire will turn its corresponding flame on Cale's world map blue, though there is no other apparent effect.

### Bonfire Ascetic Farming in DKS2

  * **Can be farmed by going from the Foyer Bonfire from Brune Tower, then towards the tower across the chain where scorching iron scepter is. There are several Ashen Crawlers inside the tower that can drop an Aesthetic and it is possible to easily kill them by setting them on fire and letting them come at melee range, thus forcing them to explode. Even better if other Ashen Crawlers are caught in the explosion as they are set on fire to repeat the cycle. Recommended to light all scones on the way as moving within fire damage AoE of the torch will set them on fire.**
  * **Enemy-based farming** : They're dropped by Phantoms and Witch Trees during the 3 trials of the Pilgrim of the Dark Covenant. The Chasm is open permanently after the Darklurker is killed once in a playthrough allowing for unlimited farming of them at no human effigy cost. Once the entrance to the dark chasm is permanently open, you can join the Covenant of Champions, preventing the enemies from despawning.
  * Even without joining the Covenant of Champions, the 3rd Chasm (Below Drangleic Castle) is the best place to farm Aesthetic. It is very close to the bonfire, compared from the method below. If you farm the chasm with max Discovery, almost every time, you will get a minimum of 1 Aesthetic per try. There are 4 enemies placed quite near to the entrance of the chasm.
  * **Scholar of the First Sin** : By using a Bonfire Ascetic in the Foregarden bonfire in Aldia's Keep, and unpetrifying the hollow next to the Basilisk in the cage, you will gain 2 ascetics. However you can respawn him for 1 ascetic, and he**will still drop them each time** , effectively allowing for infinite bonfire ascetics. Very useful for getting every NG+ item in one playthrough and getting every bonfire on Cale's map blue. You don't need to de-petrify the hollow again either.

### Soul Farming Methods with Bonfire Ascetic

  * The [Giant Lord](/Giant+Lord "Dark Souls 2 Giant Lord") boss is a good farming method for getting a very large amount of souls per run in addition to a soul vessel but is rather difficult without a heavily focused spell caster build. There is also a bonfire ascetic that respawns near the entrance, allowing for indefinite farming as long as you grab it.
  * You can also farm Ascetics themselves with the above method as one respawns in Memory of Jeigh and another respawns close to the Giant Pyromancers on the memory of Vammar. This also nets a Soul Vessel inside the Memory of Orro.

### Upgrading Materials Farming Methods with Bonfire Ascetic

  * 1x [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero"), 1x [Soul of a Great Hero](/Soul+of+a+Great+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Great Hero"), 3x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"), 3x [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"), 3x [Boltstone](/Boltstone "Dark Souls 2 Boltstone"), 3x [Bleedstone](/Bleed+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Bleed Stone"), 10x [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin"), 1x [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root") as well [Focus Souls](/Focus+Souls "Dark Souls 2 Focus Souls") sorcery can be farmed in Dragon's Sanctum by burning Ascetic at Tower of Prayer bonfire, highly recommended to lure away enemies with [Yearn](/Yearn "Dark Souls 2 Yearn") sorcery, additional Bonfire Ascetic can be obtained from a trapped wooden chest guarded by Sanctum Soldiers in the first room.**(Bonfire ascetic is replaced by a dried root in SotFS)**

### Bonfire Ascetic Notes

  * The word "ascetic" is an adjective meaning unrelenting or rigorous. This may imply that the player burning this item will encounter enemies who exhibit those same qualities.
  * An ascetic is a person who practices stringent self-discipline or self-denial and often withholds all physical gratification. The word can also be an adjective that means something characterized by the practice of self-discipline or denial. Its Greek roots come from a word meaning “training” or “exercise.” The word is usually associated with achieving spiritual goals. Thus, a bonfire ascetic is an object that allows you to train and practice self-discipline in the pursuit of higher goals by making your experience of the physical world around you harder.
  * Was know as Ember of Adversity in testing phases of [Dark Souls 2](/About+Dark+Souls+2 "About Dark Souls 2")
