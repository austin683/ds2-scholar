## **Things Betwixt**

**Things Betwixt** is a [Location](/Locations "Dark Souls 2 Locations") in **Dark Souls 2**. It is a cold, dark cave where players begin their journey. Be careful of the ledges and Ogres in the area that may lead to an instant death; leave the ogres for now, as you can come back for them later. In this area, there is also a [Coffin](/Gender+Swap+Coffin "Dark Souls 2 Gender Swap Coffin") behind a pair of Ogres which has the ability to change the player's gender if they were to enter it. Changing the player's gender is purely cosmetic, and can be reversed if the [Coffin](/Gender+Swap+Coffin "Dark Souls 2 Gender Swap Coffin") is entered once more. [Dyna and Tillo](/dyna+and+tillo "Dark Souls 2 dyna and tillo") can be found on a ledge, requesting [Smooth and Silky Stones](/Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth %26 Silky Stone") for rewards; leave this too, as again, you can come back for them later.

### Notes

### Full Things Betwixt Walkthrough

### Prowler Gazebo

After the opening cinematic, you find yourself under a stone gazebo surrounded by grass as a deprived undead. As you walk forward, and between the two rocks, you come up to another grassland where there are [Prowler Hounds](/Prowler+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Prowler Hound") running quickly around. They do not attack you and tend to flee as you come near. They will attempt to remain hidden in the tall grass and will not follow to areas in which they're exposed. They will retaliate if you attack however, and drop 30 souls when killed. Instead of going straight ahead, hug the right mountain wall to the right in this area to find an arch of stone. Walking through this leads to a cliff area where you can find a corpse holding the first item of your playthrough: a [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin").

Head back and continue straight towards the big doors at the end, hugging the left side of the mountain. You'll notice a break, covered in bush, right before the wooden bridge. Head into it and follow the footprints to a pathway where you will find an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") (drops [Stone Ring](/Stone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Stone Ring")) guarding a corpse, holding a [Gold Pine Resin](/Gold+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Gold Pine Resin"). Since you have just started and are defenseless at this point, you won't be able to claim the [Ring](/Stone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Stone Ring"). However, aggroing and luring the [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") a far enough distance away, will allow you to pick up the loot on the body, which can come in very handy in the not-so-distant future. Continuing along this path leads to a smaller wooden bridge crossing a stream. Cross it, and drop down to find a set of doors ahead on the left, and a bridge on your right. For now, look for the bushes in between yourself and the bridge and pass through it to reveal a path under the waterfall with a [Small Smooth and Silky Stone](/Small+Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth & Silky Stone").

### Self Recollection

Head back up, and into the house to trigger a cutscene with the three [firekeepers](/firekeepers "Dark Souls 2 firekeepers"). The cut-scene ends with you being asked your name, and upon entering a name for your character, another cut-scene occurs where you are given a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). After her allusion to the effigy resembling you, you are then brought to the character creation screen and completing it earns the trophy/achievement Self Recollection. After character creation you start off in the main room of the house with your starting gear and gift equipped. There are four women present, three elderly and one younger, named [Milibeth](/Milibeth "Dark Souls 2 Milibeth"). Speaking with the younger one will shed some insight into the lore. Two of the fire keepers alternate between laughing and silence when spoken to. One of them seated at the table tells you to go on your journey and invites you back. Her implication of clean slate is in reference to the [Soul Vessel](/Soul+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vessel") which you will discover later. If you go up the stairs, you'll find a chest with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy").

Walking out the door, you encounter a stone sign and a [bonfire](/bonfire "Dark Souls 2 bonfire") to the left. To the right of the door there is a cart hiding a corpse behind it. Break the cart to claim a [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead") and a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). Lighting and sitting at the bonfire brings up the bonfire menu, where you can initiate travel, attune [Spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic"), [Burn](/Burning "Dark Souls 2 Burning") items, and access the [Item Box](/Item+Box "Dark Souls 2 Item Box"). Toggling at a bonfire will allow you to use a torch, which in turn can be used to light sconces later in the level.

### Learning the Ropes

Go through the wooded tunnel straight ahead from the house and you come to a path with several mists on either side. The player can choose to enter the mists at this time which provides access to the game's tutorial. Each mist leads to a tunnel with several lessons inscribed in stone for the player to practice:

  * 1st Mist Door \- Teaches the attack function, target lock, dash, and critical hits from behind. The player winds through a short tunnel in the roots of the trees and out the other side. It is protected by several **Hollows** (they drop nothing). Climbing the small hill here leads to a corpse with a [dagger](/dagger "Dark Souls 2 dagger"). The player returns inside the tree where they learn to roll in time for the first hollow archer. Another stone will indicate how to switch [weapons](/weapons "Dark Souls 2 weapons"). A ramp is followed by a stone telling you how to back-step followed by two more **hollows** , one of whom is an **archer**. A corpse carrying a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") is found in this area and another stone with instructions on how to use an item. A mist door follows which leads out of the tree to a higher level. A stone shows you how to use your camera. Using the camera reveals a ledge you can fall to with a corpse carrying a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). Another stone tells you to "light sconces with a torch". Before jumping down, go left, which leads to [Dyna & Tilo](/Dyna+and+Tillo "Dark Souls 2 Dyna and Tillo")'s nest where items can be traded. If you collected the Small Smooth and Silky Stone earlier, you can leave it on the nest now, and the crows will replace it with a (semi-)random item. A ladder right next to the nest can be kicked down which brings you back to main path. Drop down though and get your souls and to light fire.
  * 2nd Mist Door \- On the right, illustrates how to two hand your weapon in the right hand, then another for the left hand weapon. The player again finds themselves in tunnels within a large tree. A stone tells you how to jump from a dash. Crossing a small gap in front of this stone leads to a corpse with 2x [Amber Herb](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb"). Crossing the gap again to head back, you will see a ladder near the stone with the jumping instructions. Climbing this leads to a a ledge with three tutorial stones that instruct you to parry, execute a plunging attack and guard break. You can jump off the ledge opposite the ladder you came up and practice the plunging attack on a hollow below. Another is waiting to ambush you. A stone in this spot instructs you on doing a jumping attack. A wooden door off this room leads to small dead end room with a corpse with a [Cracked Red Eye Orb](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb"). A mist door exits the main room and brings you to a bridge that crosses the main path in the tutorial. It terminates in a balcony with a sconce which will allow you to bring light to the next tutorial area. However, you will need to return to the bridge to jump down to the main path. Jumping down will lead you to the final gate.
  * 3rd Mist Door \- It is blocked by a petrified enemy, you will have to return later, when you have a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore"). When you return and un-petrify this enemy you can enter the mist gate. You will find yourself in a large chamber (that you were just overlooking) with 2 [Basilisks](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") on your side, a gap and another [Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") and a [Foreign Wanderer](/Foreign+Wanderer "Dark Souls 2 Foreign Wanderer") with a bow on the other side. Careful, this [Foreign Wanderer](/Foreign+Wanderer "Dark Souls 2 Foreign Wanderer") and the one down the hole have more health (480 in NG) than the others. Kill the [Basilisks](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk"), kick the tree and kill the enemies on the other side. You will see a hole and below, 3 [Basilisks](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") and another [Foreign Wanderer](/Foreign+Wanderer "Dark Souls 2 Foreign Wanderer") with a bow waiting for you. Drop down and kill them. Pick up the [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard") from the body, go up the ladder and cross the mist. One **hollow** will be nearby and 2 [Ogres](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") will be on the beach guarding a coffin. Examining this coffin prompts the character to enter inside. The game cuts to a loading screen and when it returns you exit the coffin. With one small difference. Your character has now changed gender. Entering this beach area will spawn a [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer"), who drops a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). The pursuer will vanish if you choose to leave the area and not fight. Note: If you don't kill the Pursuer and instead let him leave, he will respawn again after a short while when you use the coffin to change your gender. Neither the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") nor the [Ogres](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") respawn once killed.

In Scholar of the First Sin, lighting all of the braziers in **Things Betwixt** will cause a **Dark Spirit** to spawn near the entrance to the area; it will drop a [Petrified Something](/Petrified+Something "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Something") when slain, which can also be offered to [Dyna & Tillo](/Dyna+and+Tillo "Dark Souls 2 Dyna and Tillo").

### Leaving to Majula

You can visit [Milibeth](/Milibeth "Dark Souls 2 Milibeth") in the [Firekeepers](/Firekeepers "Dark Souls 2 Firekeepers") hut and she will give you a [Handmaid's Ladle](/Handmaid%27s+Ladle "Dark Souls 2 Handmaid%27s Ladle") for killing the 3 [Ogres](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre"). Once back on the main path, continue on and you will come to the oceanside hub town of [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula").

### New Game+ Differences

  * You pick up x5 [Rusted Coins](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin"), instead of a single one.
  * You pick up 3x [Small Smooth & Silky Stone](/Small+Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth & Silky Stone"), instead of a single [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth %26 Silky Stone").

A corpse carrying a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") is found in this area and another stone with instructions on how to use an item.

A stone tells you how to jump from a dash. Crossing a small gap in front of this stone leads to a corpse with 2x [Amber Herb](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb"). Crossing the gap again to head back, you will see a ladder near the stone with the jumping instructions. Climbing this leads to a a ledge with three tutorial stones that instruct you to parry, execute a plunging attack and guard break. You can jump off the ledge opposite the ladder you came up and practice the plunging attack on a [Traveler](/Foreign+Wanderer "Dark Souls 2 Foreign Wanderer") below. Another is waiting to ambush you. A stone in this spot instructs you on doing a jumping attack. A wooden door off this room leads to small dead end room with a corpse with a [Cracked Red Eye Orb](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb"). A mist door exits the main room and brings you to a bridge that crosses the main path in the tutorial. It terminates in a balcony with a sconce which will allow you to bring light to the next tutorial area. However, you will need to return to the bridge to jump down to the main path. Jumping down will lead you to the third and final tutorial section.
  * 3rd Mist Door \- You will find yourself in a large chamber (that you were just overlooking). A chasm in the middle separates you from an archer who will try to harass you with arrows. A stone near the chasm and a suspicious looking tree advises you to "search your surroundings." Naturally, this is a prompt to examine the tree which allows you the option to knock it down, crossing the chasm and allowing revenge on the archer. A hole in the floor allows you to fall below where a hollow is waiting in a pit for you. There is another **archer** above so take care of the first one quickly. A small ladder allows you out of the pit to finish the archer and exit the tree via a mist door. Proceeding around the tree will lead you back to the main path via another tree shortcut. This is protected by one **hollow**. There is also the option to visit a small beach before leaving this area. It is protected by two [Ogres](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") guards. Both of these [Ogres](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") can be easily killed if you have a ranged attack ([Soul Arrow](/Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Soul Arrow")/[Bows](/Bows "Dark Souls 2 Bows")). First you need to go to the beach in order to make the two [Ogres](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") follow you (they drop nothing), then go back to the shortcut you created thanks to the tree. Finally, at the middle of the tree, attack one [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") to make it attack you. Knock him down as if he attempts to get up, he will fall to its death. Try to repeat this with the second. This grants you a large amount of souls for the beginning of the game, and access to the [Handmaiden's Ladle](/Handmaiden%27s+Ladle "Dark Souls 2 Handmaiden%27s Ladle") from [Milibeth](/Milibeth "Dark Souls 2 Milibeth").

The only thing of note on the beach is a coffin that is partially submerged. Examining this coffin prompts the character to enter inside. The game cuts to a loading screen and when it returns you exit the coffin. With one small difference. Your character has now changed gender.

_Prior to 1.04 update, it didn't show any message telling your gender was changed, after update, it leaves a message "The nature of your being has changed"._
