### Notes and Tips About Knight

Notes: A more tank-oriented class than the Warrior, he trades some magic and attack stats for extra HP and dodging ability. This makes close combat a little easier but increases the levels necessary for learning spells. They have no particular strengths, but do START with a better sword. Though they don't start with a shield (probably because they're meant to start off 2 handing), it's easy to obtain the [Crimson Parma](/Crimson+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Parma") or buy the Silver Eagle Kite Shield from [Maughlin the Armorer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer"). Intelligence and Attunement are slightly lower than Warrior, Faith on the other hand is one point higher than Warrior, invest 6 more Attunement and Faith to use Heal.
