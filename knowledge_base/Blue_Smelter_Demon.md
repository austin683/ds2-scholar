### (Blue) Smelter Demon Information 

_"The Old Iron King's life was taken by a mass of iron that had been given a soul. Was this metal goliath there from the beginning, or was it a product of the king's conceit?"_   
  
The Blue Smelter Demon in Iron Passage, also known as the Aged Smelter Demon, is powered by magic instead of Fire. It is highly resistant to Magic and vulnerable to Dark and Lightning damage.

### Location

  * [Iron Passage](/Iron+passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron passage")

### Drops

  * [Smelter Demon Soul](/Smelter+Demon+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon Soul")
  * **Souls: 75,000 (Standard Game) 112,500 (NG+)**

###  NPC Summons

  * [Drifter Swordsman Aidel](/Drifter+Swordsman+Aidel "Dark Souls 2 Drifter Swordsman Aidel")
  * [Steel-willed Lorrie](/Steel-willed+Lorrie "Dark Souls 2 Steel-willed Lorrie")

###  Attacks
    
    
    |  | Description | Counter Measures |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Jumping Plunge | Jumps high in the air above player stabbing downwards. If the player approaches him after he has landed he will do an explosive AOE. This combo can be lethal. | As soon as he jumps, run or dodge backwards to distance yourself. The actual area he strikes is quite small. |
    | Double Horizontal Slash | Slow double slash that goes from player's left to right followed by a return slash from right to left. This double combo is often followed by his Stabbing Lunge or Jumping Slam. | Though the demon's arc is very wide, his reach is relatively small. Dodge to the left to roll under the first swing, and then dodge away from the demon to escape the reach of the second swing. Be wary of a third, vertical attack. / Alternatively: block with Rebel's Greatshield |
    | Horizontal then Vertical Cleave | Swings his sword from player's right to left and then follows it with a Vertical Cleave. | Roll right when he swing, and then roll once again. |
    | Stabbing Lunge | Very fast stab with a long reach. This can be difficult because it is significantly faster than his other attacks and can throw a player off balance. | Roll sideward. |
    | Vertical Cleave | Raises his sword above his head with two hands and cleaves downward. Once his sword is on fire this attack sends out a flaming vertical arc that travels along the ground, similar to the dragon tail weapons from Dark Souls 1. Has a long delay, different from the other attacks, making dodge timing critical. | Before his sword is aflame, you can escape the demon's reach with relative ease by rolling away from him. Once lit however, the flaming arc will reach you at any distance, so dodging to the side makes for a more effective escape. / Once the attack is dodge, you can heal or buff weapon at this brief second. / In either state, this attack has a delay to it that can cause the player to dodge too early, leaving them vulnerable. |
    | Single Horizontal Slash | Can come from either player's left or right |  |
    

  
Fight Notes:

  * During the fight he will roar with an AOE and stoke his magic flame. This will add a constant low damage burning aura (like [Immolation ](/Immolation "Dark Souls 2 Immolation")) to his person, additionally the room becomes darker and he becomes brighter. After expanding his magic flame he will stab himself with his sword doing no damage to himself but lighting his sword on fire. This greatly increases the damage his sword does.
  * In rare cases, the Immolation part won't happen. If this happens, he will still light his sword on fire at any given time, but will not do proximity damage. 
  * He seems to be able to delay every possible part of his slash attacks.
  * Pay attention to when he roars, as this provides a useful sound cue for when he will attack.

### Strategy

He has the same moveset as [Smelter Demon ](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon"), except with partial magic damage instead of fire damage.

2 summons are available not far from the bonfire. Even though they increase the number of hits required to take the boss down, the fight becomes a lot easier provided the summons are not worn out by the enemies on the way. However, once the bonfire intensity reaches 3, the white phantoms will only hinder you since red phantom versions of regular enemies started to spawn outside.

It's highly recommended to beef up items with high physical and magic resistance while keeping equip load below 50% so you can avoid being burdened by Promised Walk of Peace during the runback. The Blue Smelter Demon is weak to strike, lightning, and especially dark damage. It can also be poisoned relatively easily.

  * [Great Magic Barrier](/Great+Magic+Barrier "Dark Souls 2 Great Magic Barrier")
  * [Small Blue Burr](/Small+Blue+Burr "Dark Souls 2 Small Blue Burr")
  * Armor with good physical **and** magic resistance, such as the [Black Witch](/Black+Witch+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch Set"), [Astrologist's](/Astrologist's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Astrologist's Set"), or [Throne Watcher](/Throne+Watcher+Set "Dark Souls 2 Throne Watcher Set") sets.
