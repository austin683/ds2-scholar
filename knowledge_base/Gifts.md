**Gifts** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are starting inventory items which the player must choose from during character creation. There are eight **Gifts** to choose from in total, and can only be chosen once at the start of NG.  _All_ of the starting gift items are obtainable in-game, meaning these **Gifts** provide a temporary advantage. One fun fact about selecting **Gifts** is, you can opt to choose nothing on the list and proceed with **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** empty-handed. There's no hidden buff when not selecting a gift, so proceed with this option if you prefer to play with a dose of struggle.

## Gifts in Dark Souls 2

For players looking to get the most value out of their Gift:

  * The [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"), the [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone") and the Healing Wares can be found many times through the game. The Human Effigy and Healing Wares can give new players a bit more leeway in the early parts of the game. 
  * Of these, the Homeward Bone is likely to be the least useful, since they can also be found and bought in Majula. Later on, the Homeward Bone is made obsolete by the [Homeward](/Homeward "Dark Souls 2 Homeward") spell (for Faith users) and [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather") (for all, but found very late into the game). Homeward Bone gift also only gives 1 of it, which is barely decent to be a starting gift.
  * The [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") is relatively hard to find early on, but most new players probably won't want to use this item. It will likely only become useful much later in the game, by which time you will have found more. Experienced players can opt for it if they're looking for ng+ exclusive items (like +2 rings) very early.
  * The [Giants' Seed](/Seed+of+a+Tree+of+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Seed of a Tree of Giants") is extremely rare, but not very practical. It may help to prevent a death from an invasion, but can only be used once.
  * The [Petrified Something](/Petrified+Something "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Something") can be used in the Things Betwixt, by being left in the nest of [Dyna and Tillo](/Dyna+and+Tillo "Dark Souls 2 Dyna and Tillo") to trade for a random rare weapon or item. Its usefulness varies depending on what you receive, but is a solid choice. If the player is looking for a specific trade item, they can re-create a character with this gift until they obtain their desired item.
  * Finally, the [Life Ring](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") increases your HP, but only by 5%, and it, along with upgraded versions of itself, can be found later in the game. Also Life Ring is found very early into the game, in the Forest of the Fallen Giants.

  
_(Note: If you pick the Life Ring, don't forget to actually equip it, because your character won't be wearing it automatically.)_
