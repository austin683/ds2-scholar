###    
Loyce Gauntlets Description

_"These Knights of Loyce were devoted guardians of this land that delved valiantly into the depths of chaos, never to return.  
The few that survived remain in Eleum Loyce, now frozen over, awaiting the call of their master."_

###   
  
Where to Find \ Location

  * Given by [Alsanna, Silent Oracle](/Alsanna "Dark Souls 2 Alsanna") for collecting [Loyce Souls](/Loyce+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Soul") from [Charred Loyce Knights](/Charred+Loyce+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Knight") in [The Old Chaos](/Old+Chaos "Dark Souls 2 Old Chaos") for 5 Souls.

### 

### Notes

    * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
    * Upgraded physical defenses are only 25% higher.
    * While slightly inferior to [Charred Loyce Set](/Charred+Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Set") statwise, this set is more durable and weighs less.
    * Each piece of the set absorbs 10 HP from each defeated foe **ONLY** if the wearer is female. This effect stacks between pieces, as well as with pieces of [Charred Loyce Set](/Charred+Loyce+Set "Dark Souls 2 Charred Loyce Set"), [Ivory King set](/Ivory+King+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Ivory King Armor"), [Wicked Eye Greatshield](/Wicked+Eye+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Wicked Eye Greatshield"), [Butcher's Knife](/Butcher's+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Butcher's Knife") and any version of [Ring of the Evil Eye](/Ring+of+the+Evil+Eye "Dark Souls 2 Ring of the Evil Eye").
