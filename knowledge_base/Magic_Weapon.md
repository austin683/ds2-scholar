### Magic Weapon Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Buffs weapon with magic damage. Duration scales with Intelligence: 63 sec. at 10 Int, and up to 135 sec. at 15 Int. Weaker than [Great Magic Weapon](/Great+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Great Magic Weapon") and [Crystal Magic Weapon](/Crystal+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Magic Weapon").
  * Despite being the weakest Weapon Buff in the game, its low stat requirement and high spell uses/duration make it a great way to deal extra damage without spending souls for resins or having to level intelligence any more than you might need to use its large variety of support sorceries.
  * DS2's buff formula differs from other Souls games, instead relying primarily on the targeted weapon's base damage to determine how much AR the spell buff will add. Matching the spell buff with a damage type present on a weapon will add a flat bonus to the total AR, depending on whatever the weapon is infused with and/or naturally inflicts said damage type. A small scaling bonus is also added unless the targeted weapon doesn't scale at all with any stats.
