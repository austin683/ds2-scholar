**Aurous Invisible Leggings** is a **legging** and a part of [Aurous Set ](/Aurous+Set "Dark Souls 2 Aurous Set") in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Aurous Invisible Leggings Description

Leggings of kings of the desert land of Jugo. First worn by Aurous, the land's heroic founder.   
According to legend, the armor of Aurous is composed of a mysterious substance that cannot be seen by cowards. What do your eyes tell you?

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Spend 15k souls at [Maughlin's](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") shop in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), then come back with zero souls. Talk to him and he'll give you the set.
  * Dropped by dark spirit [Rhoy the Explorer](/Rhoy+the+Explorer "Dark Souls 2 Rhoy the Explorer") in [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints").

  
  

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Raises equipment load: helm & gauntlets +1%, chest and leggings +1.5%, 5% total.
  * Contrary to popular belief, it's impossible to make this set visible by ranking up in the [Company of Champions](/Company+of+Champions "Dark Souls 2 Company of Champions") covenant.
  * Armor becomes visible when aiming a bow. This can only be seen briefly as you change to first person view.
  * Armor becomes visible when rolling with the simpleton's ring. It can only be seen briefly at the beginning and end of the roll before you become invisible.
  * In addition to giving extra carry weight the whole set is incredibly light for the protection provided, essentially freeing up a lot of soul levels which would have otherwise been spent on VIT.
