##  Location:

The 5th bonfire of [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower") only accesible after obtaining the [Scorching Iron Scepter](/Scorching+Iron+Scepter "Dark Souls 2 Scorching Iron Scepter").   
From the Foyer bonfire, go down the steps and take a left. Continue around until you come to the lift that goes up. Take the lift up and when you come to the top there will be another lift to your left recessed into the wall. Take the lift up and when you reach the top get off to your right (if you rode up facing the back wall). There will be a gate (need the Tower Key to open) and through the gate another lift. Once you reach the top you will be on a small landing with a short flight of stairs leading up on your right. An Ashen Idol will be on the right and an entryway leading to the stairs will be on your left that lead up towards the Eygil Bull Statue. At this point you will be invaded by Prowlers. The next room on the opposite side will be the bonfire and in the middle an armor stance with [Sir Alonne's ](/Sir+Alonne "Dark Souls 2 Sir Alonne")armor and sword. The Armor Stance is a Memory Area (just like that of the fallen Giants after obtaining the Ashen Mist Heart) this is the [Memory of the Old Iron King](/Memory+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the Old Iron King"). This memory can only be accesed after defeating the [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight").

##  Special Notes:

Before you reach the bonfire in the area you will be invaded by Prowlers near the [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol"). Be wary these are **multiple** red phantoms and the first one you encounter is in the middle of the room with the Ashen Idol the rest will spawn as soon as you try to go up the stairs towards the bonfire.   
Be sure to take out the Ashen Idol after defeating the first one since she can heal these phantoms.   
If you reach the Ashen Idol before the first invader fully spawns you can take it out. His attacks wont hurt you while inserting the Smelter Wedge. This makes it easier to kill the first invader.
