* **Approaching[Frozen Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Eleum Loyce") for the first time**   

  * _You, approaching Eleum Loyce, Turn back. The old Chaos hungers still._

  

  * **Approaching[Aava, the King's Pet](/Aava%2C+the+King%27s+Pet "Dark Souls 2 Aava%2C the King%27s Pet")**  
_Go back. Aava is watching. Go back._

  

  * **Approaching[Eye of the Priestess](/Eye+of+the+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Eye of the Priestess")**  
_Turn away. And never look back. No one must ever find that which is sheltered in Eleum Loyce._

  

  * **First Conversation at the[Grand Cathedral](/Grand+Cathedral "Dark Souls 2 Grand Cathedral")**  
_To think Aava could be bested… Who are you?This land is barren, Cursed, by the old Chaos. It gave birth to atrocities, and the people fled in fear. Until our lord, the Ivory King, came._

  

  * **Second conversation at the[Grand Cathedral](/Grand+Cathedral "Dark Souls 2 Grand Cathedral")**  
_My dear lord, a most true king. It was with his magnificent soul that he build Eleum Loyce… …and contained the spread of Chaos. But the Chaos would not be sated, and the King gave his own soul._

  

  * **Third conversation at the[Grand Cathedral](/Grand+Cathedral "Dark Souls 2 Grand Cathedral")**  
_Inevitably, the King was drained of vigor, and plunged into the Chaos' heart. Eleum Loyce was frozen in time, it's leader lost… I remain here, to contain the Chaos, honoring my Lord's wishes. Perhaps one day, he will return… There's nothing here, save that accursed flame…_

  

  * **Fourth conversation at the[Grand Cathedral](/Grand+Cathedral "Dark Souls 2 Grand Cathedral")**  
_I have but one wish. That my Lord might be freed from that unspeakable Chaos. I haven't the strength to help him myself, but perhaps one such as you… Though I am yet to know your name, stranger, will you lend me your strength?_

  

    * **If you answer "No"**

  * _Then be gone. There's nothing here, nothing at all. Speaking to her again if answered No previously Stranger. Are you now prepared to plunge into Chaos?_

  

    * **If you answer "Yes"**

  * _Kind visitor, I thank you. Let me open the path to Chaos. And please, do all you can…_

  

    * **After you have answered "Yes"**

  * _Many of Eleum Loyce's faithful knights followed their Lord into the Chaos. But none of them returned. The King's dutiful subjects waited patiently for His homecoming. But it was too long a wait to bear… The knights of Eleum Loyce await a new leader. One who will guide them into Chaos. After having freed all Loyce Knights. The knights, reborn will follow your word._

  

  * **Once all dialogue is exhausted**  
_Go on, kind visitor. May you reach your journey's end, one day._
