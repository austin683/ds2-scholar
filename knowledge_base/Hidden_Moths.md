**Hidden Moths** are **[Secrets](/Secrets "Dark Souls 2 Secrets")** in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki") that are hidden, unique creatures and new additions to the game since the [Scholar of the First Sin](/Dark+Souls+II+Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin") Edition release. These creatures, which are also called Great Moths or Butterflies are usually found near Bonfire [Locations](/Locations "Dark Souls 2 Locations") and are usually stationary beings that rest on walls. When encountered, they are usually found above eye level, bearing their patterned wings. Shoot them down to gain loot.

### Hidden Moth Information 

Hidden Moths are non-respawning enemies which can be hart to spot since they are not found at eye level and may found on ceilings, or concealed by structures or nature. When searching for all Hidden Moths, look near different Bonfire Locations and be sure to pan the camera upwards to check each area for signs of their wings. Hit them with any ranged attack to hopefully get them down and then take their drop.
