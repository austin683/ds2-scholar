##  Build Strategy

Pretty balanced build. Easy to play. I never played Dark Souls 1 and I started playing Dark Souls 2 with the release of Scholar of the First Sin, however with this build I beat the game. It has a really nice melee damage and you can use the shield to stop those hard hitting enemies, like the drakekeepers. The lack of adaptability makes the use of the shield really important. You can always swap the shield for a Drangleic Shield, but I like this one more.   
The pyromancy is just a support just like the bow, but still you can use it if you feel like you need it. The dragonrider bow makes a huge amount of damage and can easily one shot kill most of the enemies, or at least hit them really hard if you hit them in the head. The Black Knight Greatsword can be changed for a Claymore +10, it is a nice weapon too.
