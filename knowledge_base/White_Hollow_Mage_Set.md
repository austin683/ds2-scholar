**White Hollow Mage Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
_"Hood/Robe worn by Hollowed Drangleic mages._   
_Drangleic mages wore different garb depending on their sex. What function this served, however, is unknown, as with many old practices. This is a men's hood/robe."_

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Hollow Mages](/Hollow+Mage) in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora).

  
  

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite).
  * Hood grants +1 to INT.
  * Hood offers second highest magic defense (almost equal to that of [Black Hollow Mage](/Black+Hollow+Mage+Set) hood and [Black Witch](/Black+Witch+Set) Veil).
  * Compared to [Black Hollow Mage Set](/Black+Hollow+Mage+Set), the white hood is superior and heavier, while the robe is inferior, but lighter.
  * It is implied that Hollow Mages are male.

###  Piece Information & Upgrades

First row = Regular. Second row = +10
