**Hints and Tips:**   

  * Bring lots of Fire DEF, and strongly recommend Flash Sweat pyromancy
  * There's nothing particularly special about this shield, it was a design contest winner. So decide for yourself if it's worth obtaining (Except its high fire damage reduction which can very useful in upcoming fight against the [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon)).
