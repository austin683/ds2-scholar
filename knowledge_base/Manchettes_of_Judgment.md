### Manchettes of Judgment Description

_"A manchettes honoring an ancient goddess. Sin was said to be her domain, but the name of the goddess is long forgotten."_  
_"Little is known about what purpose the mask/robe/manchettes/tights served, only that it was worn by a person of great authority."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * The [Judgment Set](/Judgment+Set "Dark Souls 2 Judgment Set") can be found after the first [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper") in the Dragon Shrine. After you killed him, there are boxes and behind them is a Pharros' Contraption. Activate this, and a magic wall appears on the side wall. Break it and open the chest for the Judgement set and the Staff of Wisdom.

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")
  * The appearance and item description of this set indicates that these were the clothes worn by Cromwell the Pardorner and Oswald of Carim in the previous game. (Oswald is an NPC with the ability to absolve a player of Sin)
