### Royal Swordsman Strategy Tips in DS2

  * They are weak to Thrust (i.e. Spears) type attacks.
  * Royal Swordsmen are weak individually but they work in teams and can easily overwhelm the player if they trap them in a corner. Greatsword wielding soldiers will attempt to rush the player while their comrades armed with crossbows will open fire from a distance.
  * These enemies have low poise and are easily staggered. It is advisable to use ranged attacks to thin their numbers when they assault the player in a group.
