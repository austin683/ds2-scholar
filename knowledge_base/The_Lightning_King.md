##  Build Strategy

Revolving around lightning based combat, this could easily be one of the better builds as lightning is the best element for poise damage. Remember to always have your weapons enchanted with Sunlight Blade for maximum damage as your faith build excels with lightning enchanted weapons. 

For ranged attacks, always have Sunlight spear at the ready and Wrath of the Gods as a backup for when the fighting gets up close and personal.
