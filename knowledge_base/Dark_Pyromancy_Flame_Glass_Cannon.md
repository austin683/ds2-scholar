greetings, this is my theory on [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame), which is an elitist weapon since it scales with hollowing, however it does offer a better scaling than the default Pyromancy Flame, so how do we put the flame to full protential The answer is, overclocking the stat with Soul Vessel and Curse, once Red Tearstone Ring is activated, with all the stats and fire damage bonus combined together, it has slightly better spell adjustment for pyromancy, for instance it inflicts 800 damage for each Great Combustion cast upon 50int. but it requires 99 int to be useful, otherwise at 50int, the scaling has no notable difference between default flame and dark flame.   
  
Optional: you may also pick Sorcerer starter class instead of Deprived, though Deprived class has more freedom on reallocating stats.   
  
(Warning: this is a experimental build for testing theory on Dark Pyromancy Flame, practicalness requires further testing)   
(I recommend you to reallocate to achieve this build instead of solely investing on Intelligence at the beginning, since 50 int, 50 faith and 43 attumenet, and Great Resonant Soul are the mimimum requirements on farming Giant Lord)

##  Rank 1 Build - Entry Class Dark Pyro Glass Cannon (Minimum Requirement)

### 

###  Stat:
    
    
    | Class / | Soul Level / | Vigor / | Endurance / | Vitality / | Attunement / | Strength / | Dexterity / | Adaptability / | Intelligence / | Faith / |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Deprived / | 130 / | 6 / | 6 / | 6 / | 43 / | 6 / | 6 / | 6 / | 99 / | 6 / |
    

### 

###  Description:

This is the entry class build of this class under the lowest Soul Level requirement, you can invest it further on Endurance and Adaptability if you want, however, **DO NOT** invest on Vigor. your goal is to push the scaling to the max and activate the Red Tearstone Ring in order to kill your foes with 1-2 hits, or at least a massive sum of damage, 43 attunement is for Forbidden Sun. you only mean of melee is Pyromancy Flame or fist melee with   

### 

###  Equipment:

  * Head: Chaos Hood
  * Armor: Lion Mage Robe
  * Arm: Penal Handcuff
  * Leg: Lion Mage Skirt
  * Right Hand Weapon: **Dark Pyromancy Flame +10** , Dagger +9
  * Left Hand weapon: Dagger +9, Pyromancy Flame +10
  * Ring: Clear Bluestone Ring +2, Red Tearstone Ring, Chloranthy Ring +2, Northern Ritual Band +2 (or Ring of Life Protection)
  * Hollowing level: fully hollowed
  * you cannot wield shield, in fact, shield is useless here

  

###  Spells:

Basically all offensive pyromancy spells e.g. Great Fireball, Great Combusion, Forbidden Sun, Flame Swathe, Chaos Storm, etc.   
  

###  Leveling:

actively engaged in invasion or killing Giant Lord offline (by doing so you need to invest on Faith to at least 50)   
  

###  How to Achieve Full Hollowing:

in order to achieve full hollowing, find a Curse Jar in Huntsman's Copse, Shaded Wood or Shrine of Amana, or Queen Nashandra's painting in Drangleic Castle, Curse status will push you to further hollowing without death. now you have 50% of health, next, wear Northen Ritual Band +2 and then put it off to lower your health to 25% of your total health, it's still counted as 50% of your health, now purposely fall down, poisoning yourself with Dung Pie, castng hexes with Abyss Seal or to be hit by weak enemies, to lower your health to 30% below, lava next to Iron Keep's first bonfire may also help. and now, with the help of Red Tearstone Ring, Full Hollow, and Penal Cuff, enjoy the 800 fire Damage per each great combustion casting.   
  

###  Notice:

sinnning does not affect the hollowing scaling, 50% health is already the full scaling. all you need is only Red Tearstone Ring left.

##  Rank 2 Build - Advanced Dark Pyro Glass Cannon (With Adaptability + Endurance)

  

    
    
    | Class / | Soul Level / | Vigor / | Endurance / | Vitality / | Attunement / | Strength / | Dexterity / | Adaptability / | Intelligence / | Faith / |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Deprived / | 316 / | 6 / | 99 / | 6 / | 43 / | 6 / | 6 / | 99 / | 99 / | 6 / |
    

###  Description:

now you have the high Endurance and Adapability for contineous casting and rolling, now you're agile enough on dodging enemies, and slightly more health after this tiring leveling. the next thing you can invest on are Faith and the rest of the stat except Vigor, or else the full hollowing would be pointless.   

### 

###  Equipment:

  * Same as Rank 1 Build

  

###  Spells:

Basically all offensive pyromancy spells e.g. Great Fireball, Great Combusion, Forbidden Sun, Flame Swathe, Chaos Storm, etc.

    | Mandryl / | As spending points above 20 in Endurance only increases stamina by 1, I'd highly recommend considering putting points elsewhere. I'd / leave it at 50, as that should give you plenty of stamina. After all, you'd probably end up having time to regenerate stamina by the time you used about 30 or 40 Endurance-worth of stamina. Maybe boost vitality just so you're not hardly weighed down by anything? / |
