**Wrath of the Gods** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle.

> "Miracle that releases local shockwave, staggering nearby foes and causing heavy damage.  
>   
> Little is known about the origins of this miracle, except its shared roots with the Force spell. It makes mention of certain Gods, but alas, their actual names are long forgotten."

### Acquired From

  * Achieving rank #2 of the [Blue Sentinels](/Blue+Sentinels "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinels")

### Wrath of the Gods Notes

  * Scaling for this miracle provides one cast below 43 Attunement, a second cast at 43, and a third cast upon reaching 99.
  * Damage dealt by this spell is classified as Lightning.
  * Use this miracle as a "wake-up" attack against opponents who have been backstabbed, riposted, or knocked down.
  * Position yourself in narrow corridors or near obstructions to maximize effectiveness, as the shockwave can penetrate walls to hit enemies in cover.
  * Use the spell's wall-piercing properties to trigger explosive barrels on the opposite side of the wall near the Cardinal Tower bonfire to open the shortcut to the Pursuer platform.
  * Bait opponents in PvP by beginning the casting animation as if to use a healing miracle; those who rush in without guarding can be caught in the blast for full damage.
  * Be cautious during offensive use in open areas, as the long casting animation allows opponents to easily evade via rolling i-frames or simply moving out of range.
