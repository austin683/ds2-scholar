**Poison Moth (Great Moth)** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.   

  

  

Moon Butterflies that sit in the trees and periodically emit a cloud of poisonous spores. Poison can build up very quickly if you're not aware of where and when the clouds will spawn, so exercise caution, or just kill them with ranged weapons as they die very easily, the armor [Moon Butterfly Set](/Moon+Butterfly+Set) is based on this creature.
