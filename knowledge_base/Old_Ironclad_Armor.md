_"O_ _ld armor worn by ironclad soldiers. Boasts high defense, but extremely heavy._

_One day, warriors wearing decrepit armor emerged from Drangleic castle, and quietly assumed positions amongst the royal army._

_Not one of them ever spoke a word, or revealed the face under the mask.__"_

### Location

  * Found on the [Turtle Knights](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") in [The Forest of Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants")****(Soldiers Rest is an ideal area to farm this set).

### Notes

  * Part of the [Old Ironclad Set](/Old+Ironclad+Set "Dark Souls 2 Old Ironclad Set").  

    * Set requires 14 Strength.
  * Effect: Nullifies foes' critical hits 
    * Safeguard from backstabs with their scripted animation. A great choice for when venturing and exploring the mist area before the Shaded Ruins, or to block Invaders who are mostly focused to execute most deadly backstabs.
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab").
