**Dragon Acolyte Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
_Hood changed to: "Hood worn by a Dragon Acolyte sorcerer. The man claims to have sealed himself away, but who's ever heard of sentient magic?_   
_It is no doubt difficult to judge the veracity of the man's words, but this hood certainly seems to possess an unusual power."_   
_"Robe/Gloves/Leggings worn by a Dragon Acolyte sorcerer. He calls himself Navlaan, now."_

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Dragon Acolytes](/Dragon+Acolyte "Dragon Acolytes") in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia's+Keep "Aldia's Keep"), except for mask.
