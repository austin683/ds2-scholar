### DS2 Dragonslayer's Crescent Axe Hints and Tips

  * Be warned, there is one additional hollow in the area that WILL screw up auto-target, and WILL cause you to turn your back to the flexile sentry and get clubbed in the head.
  * Upgraded using [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5.
  * It can be buffed with any type of pine resin, despite it being an elemental weapon. It's recommended to use gold pine resin to get even more lightning damage.
  * This axe has a faster swing speed and unique move set compared to other axes, with the exception of powerstancing two Dragonslayer's Crescent Axes, it's the same moveset as other axes.
  * In the original release, the Dragonslayer's Crescent Axe is found on a corpse together with the Golden Falcon Shield, which may have originally been intended as a reference to the Wheel of Time book series, particularly the characters Perrin who uses a Crescent Axe and his wife Zarine who is strongly associated with falcons.
