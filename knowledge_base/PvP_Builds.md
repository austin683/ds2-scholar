### Description

This is mainly a Dex/Faith build that uses a variety of Dex weapons to adapt to your opponent's setup. The Dexbro mainly utilizes Rapiers, Pate's Spear and the Uchigatana, as well as powerful faith spells to pressure the enemy.

This build is perfect for surprising your opponent, as you are using weapons that deal quick damage at high, medium and low ranges. This gives you the tools to dictate the fight with small poison weapons, high counter damage, and ranged attacks, all while keeping the enemy at bay.

### Description

For the most part, this build is amazing. BUT, it does not really work well against opponents with high poise. You want to stunlock your opponent to death. A small weapon that attacks quickly and deals good poise damage is ideal. Also, because of you high poise, you can spam parry. I know this is considered bad etiquette by some people, but whatever.

### Description

Most Sora builds I've seen just use the key-blade, this one uses magic (cause Sora could use magic and it represents Donald), and the watcher shield (its Goofy's shield, and because the watchers face semi looks like mickey mouse ears) fun and very surprisingly effective key-blade build. has agape ring capabilities. since you don't have to upgrade the key at all the agape ring will put you at a pretty big soul memory advantage over everyone who has to lvl their character AND their weapon.  
Includes many optional Kingdom Hearts themed equipment choices for build variety. Actually viable now that new game players can play with new game + and is actually pretty easy to set up just some minor farming for your chest piece and legs. the rest will come as you play through the game. I just use bonfire ascetics if I wanna fight bosses again since if you go to new game plus you lose your key-blade until you journey to the demon of song again.

### Description

This Build is for Expert Player. Your reaction speed have to be extremely fast as you have low ADP and do only medium roll . Fast to counter and trading damage, that's what your high HP and medium Armor for.

Armor like Artorias : Alonne's Helm +5 (The one From the DLC Boss) , Raime's Armor +5 , Charred Loyce Gauntlets +5 , Charred Loyce Leggings +5

Rings for the Fast and Heavy Hitter : Chloranthy Ring +2 , Third Dragon Ring , Dark Clutch Ring , Fire Clutch Ring

Weapons : Right Hand : Fire Black Knight Ultra Greatsword +5 with Cleric's Sacred Chime (Fast casting spd)

Left Hand : Dark Majestic Greatsword +5 with Pyromancy's Flame +10

Spells : Flame Weapon (Buff Fire Black Knight Ultra Greatsword for more Fire Damage, combo with Fire Clutch Ring)

Denial (For a 2nd chance in case you are bad at trading damage)

Remember to switch between 2 handed stance between both weapon as both have very different move set.

If opponent like to parry or roll, use two handed Fire Black Knight Ultra Greatsword that can't be parry and it have large sweeping attack.

For fighting high poise opponent, two handing Dark Majestic on your left hand gave you Artorias poise breaking moveset and also better stat scaling.

That's all, have fun. Praise the Dark Abbysal Sun.

  * FTH 1/8

### Description

This is a close to pure melee build I made and have had a lot of fun with for several months now, the power of this build is not in having a higher attack damage or being able to soak up more hits than your opponent, this build shines because you will be able to counter whatever build your opponent is using, be sure to change your weapons and tactics to counter that of your opponents, if you do not do this you will fail with this build.

Armor (This is my preference, feel free to change to your liking) Helm--Alonne Captain, Torso--Dark Armor, Gauntlets--Engraved Gauntlets, Boots-- Dark Boots

Rings -- ROB+2, Chloranthy Ring+2, Third Dragon Ring, Stone Ring (the stone ring can be traded out if you are not worried about high poise opponents)

Weapons (Using the exact weapons listed is key to this build, please do not deviate and read the notes for each weapon)

Right Hand:

RH1=Darkdrift Katana+10 (Use against turtles(the R2 gets around 50% shield penetration, be sure to two hand so they can not circle for an easy back-stab, if the first swing connects go for the second swing), also against short weapon users, and frequent dodgers(rolling).)

RH2=Pate's Spear+5 (This is your go to weapon, utilize the running attack to catch people off guard(carefully, a missed attack leaves you wide open) do not use against anyone with a good parry weapon/shield in their left hand. Also be sure to two hand if your opponent has medium to heavy armor on!)

Left Hand:

LH1=Royal Kite shield (This is really only to counter high poke opponents, think thrusting swords or spears, maybe the occasional spin to win halberd. Only use as a combo with the spear)

LH2=Old Whip+5 (This is the key weapon for countering parry spammers, use the running whip attack then follow up with the Darkdrift to punish them when they roll after their parry fail.)

LH3=Pyromancy Flame+10 (I use Forbidden Sun to punish flaskers when I play in the Dragon Covenant and Warmth for Fight Clubs

This build takes a bit of practice but is extremely effective when used correctly, just try to make sure you are using the right weapon combo to give yourself the advantage. To help people I have include the Variety build cheat sheet: 2 hand Spear>Havels(high poise), Spear/shield>rapiers, Darkdrift/whip>parry, Pyromancy/Forbidden Sun>Estus, Spear/Whip>all medium to short weapons(if low poise), 2 hand Darkdrift R2>Shield, Aggressive spear>Mage(if you can dodge).

If you stick to these guidelines and practice a bit I'm sure you'll be glad that you tried this build. I currently have around an 85% win ratio on Iron Keep Bridge and a 70% win ratio in Blood Brothers arena using this build. Good Luck and Praise the Sun! -BrokenBushido

### Description

Hello everyone! I'm back today with another PvP Build, and this time I tried to do a cosplay of the famous Undead Prince Ricard.  
First off, this build is really personal, I tried to match stopping power with low weight equipment (and I did it, the build it's 50%/total weight)  
I used: third dragon's ring, life ring+3, chlornanthy +2, blades +2  
ricard's rapier, target shield, elite knight elm the rest is full knight set (not elite).  
The Rapier it's really strange, it doesn't have a properly parry animation but it's really fast, it's like a retard version of the monastery scimitar.  
And the target shield it's also good for parryes.

### Description

A viable PvP cosplay of the main character from the Bloodborne trailers.  
Equipment:  
Right hand 1 - Dark Bandit Axe +10  
Right hand 2 - Dark Wrathful Axe +5 (or dark halberd +10 if the first DLC is unavailable)  
Right hand 3 - Dark Great Machete +10

Left hand 1 - Raw Sanctum Crossbow +10 (with dark bolts and heavy bolts)  
Left hand 2 - Lighting Priest's Chime +10 (2 great heals and 1 sacred oath, only used at start of duels)  
Left hand 3 empty

Rings - Flynn's ring (steel protection + 2 if first DLC is unavailable), Third Dragon Ring, Ring of Blades +2, Cloranthy Ring +2

Armor - Hunter's Hat, Robe, Manchettes, and Tights of Judgement

Strategy:  
Start off the duel by casting sacred oath for that sweet bonus damage and defense. The main weapon will be the great machete, which is decent at mid-range melee combat. Make use of its range and hitbox to surprise people who are trying to roll away from you. Switch to the andit axe for close-range melee and the wrathful axe for criticals, AoE, and for the moveset as a substitute for the machete in mid-range. The crossbow should be used at long range combat and at the end of a meleee combo but be careful using it to finish combos because of the reload time. This build works best in NG with a semi-low soul memory, but is still viable at high soul memory however the great machete and crossbow will be less useful. Your playstyle should be aggressive since the lack of a shield means you will be more vulnerable to attack if you create an opening for your opponent. Try to rely on rolling/backstepping. A good combo if facing someone with a short enough weapon is to backstep and then fire a shot from the crossbow. Have fun and prepare yourself for the stream of messages saying "nice bloodborne cosplay" and such. :)

So, here It is.  
It's quite personal, and it's kinda good.  
Yes, it really is.  
This build it's also based on 3 ring, third dragon's ring, blade ring+2 and the chloranthy ring+2 I also use dark/fire/lighting/steel (protection) ring.  
The strategy it's really easy. it's based on punish the ppls who try to hit you, but how?  
just roll and attacky nothing too difficult, but here is the real deal.  
I seen really clearly ppls, get distracted by the gesture, and they don't know what to do, and that's your attempt to close the duel.

### Description

The Point of this build is to wait for you're victim to make a move.  
When you have high agility and high dex attack , you don't need to worry about those huge Havel smashers or Giant Dads. All you need to do is time you're dodges and distract them with fire bombs, throwing knives (lacerating preferably) and unpredictable movements .When in need for extra annoyance to your prey;coat you're blade with resonant blade,dark blade or bleeding serums (also use certain AOE hexes when the time comes like dark fog or dark storm).*ONLY ATTACK WHEN YOU FIND AND OPENING,IMMEDIATELY ROLL AWAY WHEN DAMAGE IS DEALT* .Amour and weapons used in this build.....  
Armor:Thief Hood +10 Shadow armor +10 Engraved Gauntlets +5 Manikin Boots +10  
Rings: Third Dragon Ring,Ring of Blades +2, Chloranthy Ring +2 and Ring of Giants +2  
Weapons: Darkdrift +10 Dragonrider Bow+10 Any Chime or Staff for Dark blade,Resonant blade,Dark fog and other AOE hexes. Decide wisely .  
(Note when when leveling past 192, level up endurance, vigor and adaptability)  
You must analyse you're opponent before you jump in combat , wait for him/her to make a move. Be unpredictable and constantly evolve you're fighting tactics .

### Description

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Anti-Mage%20Crusader%20Build%20175.jpg)

Stat reasoning  
All of my typical standards that I like in a solid build  
40/40 is pretty fricken solid for weapon variety  
VIT enough to make a 50% carry  
INT/FTH min for Silverblack  
10 ATN for spell variety, original intention was Warmth for Fight Clubs  
22 ADP, I take at least 20 always

Weapons and Weapon reasoning  
Right hand  
Silverblack Spear - I approve of this moveset and I really like how it looks. Damage is good too.  
Dagger - Critical Damage is killer for when you parry. Don't backstab fish unless you're a scrub.  
Pyromancy Hand - Works better in Right than Left, needed for spells  
Left Hand  
Magic Magic Shield - Good for laggy mages, but I mainly used to go with the color scheme. Buckler parry animation.  
Sanctum Crossbow - This thing is a beast. You can poke with regular bolts, or two hand it and shoot a massive death shot. People don't expect it.  
N/A - Quick Switching between shield and crossbow

Armor and reasoning  
Thief Mask - Complements G. Warden Top amazingly, and I'm always liked how it looked on Males, but could never match it well.  
Grave Warden Top - Fits well with Thief Mask and Havel's Gauntlets. Approve of the kind of Toga style across the chest.  
Havel's Gauntlets - A bit of poise, defense, and style, all in one. Mainly used for style, also used because I love H. Gauntlets  
Imperious Leggings - Loved the look of these since I was experimenting with a lot of builds. Decent armor/poise and good style.

Rings and Reasoning  
Third Dragon Ring - Health, Stamina, Increased Load  
Ring of Blades +2 - Damage, Damage, DAMAGE  
Chloranthy Ring +2 - Stamina Recovery everywhere  
Life Ring +2 - Little bit of extra health to effectively trade or survive with, can be swapped with other rings

Mage/Hexer/Pyromancer - 89% - Worked extremely well against nearly pure Spell/Hex/Pyromancy users.  
Tank - 72% - Varies with tank style, not many tanks in DS2 for good reason. Silverblack is good poke either way.  
Standard Warrior - 79% - Depending on style, was mildly to greatly effective with pokes. Switch up a lot with R2s.  
Super Buffed Monster (SBM) - 48% - Using every buff in the game is difficult to deal with. Figured out toward the latter fights to constantly avoid and very few jabs.  
HAVEL MONSTER - 61% - Havel Monsters have been nerfed, but are still existant. Few of these could be classified as SBMs?  
Squishy Backstab Fisher - 74% - Play smart and don't go for second attack if you don't hit. Spear set leave you open. Use R2s though.  
Jester's Monster - 82% - Not many criticals are needed on this, but I parried over half of these guys. Sorry Jester's users, but some of you are bad.  
Tell me if I could put more categories for ER. Minimum for me to put a good ER rating is 10 matches at least, though I factor damage/remaining health.

Flexibility Options  
With a 40/40 build, it's extremely easy if you don't intend to host fight clubs or use the ATN for anything to just  
set ATN back to it's base of 4. Same aspect with Silverblack, set it back to 6 FTH and 3 INT. Overall, that's 17  
extra points for you to use back in the bank. Personally, when I tested flexibility, I put it into Endurance and Adaptability.  
With the 40/40 build and the carry weight, a lot of weapons can be used with this. If it gets to heavy, use extra points for VIT  
or pick up Royal Soldier's Ring +2. Also note you can swap in a lot of ranged weapons for Sanctum, but I suggest Sanctum Crossbow.

### Description

The Starter Class it's the knight due the fact he allready have a alot STR points.  
The glorious Mastodon Halberd it's quite heavy (16.0), and with 35 points in VIT plus the third dragon's ring you have 99.0 Eq.Load, and that's great, if you want change the weapons it's perfect becouse you have actually a great wayside of Load for your equipment to have also the good roll (the mid-fast roll of dks2).  
So what now?  
The build itself it's basically doing the "fake move", all the dark souls 2 player when they see you have an halaberd in your hands roll against you when you do the dash, becouse they think you gonna do the "spin2win" move, but that's also don't happen due the fact, when they roll you just have to go behind and go for a darn backstab, if you have enchanted your weapons will do also a really great damage (1.5k+), and also in level range 140-160 not much ppls have more than 1900 hp.  
So it's basically 1h1k, but when the oppent understand your strategy he will not roll against you, go for a spin2win, you will also deal damage, but remember the "spin2win" move it's really easy to parry, so becareful with that.

Starting Class - Knight  
Started off as a spin-off of a build I helped someone make, has turned into  
one of my builds I like a lot.  
Armor is mostly aesthetic, although has a lot of utility.  
Stats are distributed in either necessary spots or for bonus to damage or survivability.  
Manikin Knife is my favorite knife. Hunter's Blackbow has an S scaling in Dexterity.  
Previously I had a Washing Pole ready to switch off as a quick swap with  
Dragonslayer, but I tossed the idea.  
Dragonslayer is effect at it's range and can be used to just throw people off their game.  
Rings are Ring of Blades +2, Chloranthy Ring +2, Third Dragon Ring, Ring of Giants +2  
  
If you have questions or just want to know more about me,

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/third%20dragon%20king.jpg)  
Starting Class - Knight  
Quick Stat Explanation  
Just a lot of min/maxing  
  
Dexterity got a lot of extra points thrown into it  
Endurance has a good amount for plenty of swings  
Vigor has a decent amount put right at the border of how much I wanted in it  
Strength is at the minimum I need to use most of the  
weapons that go well with this build  
Vitality is at it's minimum to be efficient  
  
Quick Item Explanation  
I'm using Mirrah Greatsword because Lucatiel is  
a character I absolutely love as well as the A scaling in Dexterity  
Other weapons can be used, as I've also used  
Washing Pole, Murakumo, Drakewing Ultra Greatsword, Black Knight Halberd,  
and others.  
Blossom Kite Shield can be left unupgraded, but it's secondary purpose comes  
after upgrading it and infusing it with poison. 100% Poison Blocks.  
Mytha's can be replaced by any Knife or Dagger that you prefer  
that has high Critical if you can't afford to use a lot of Petrified Dragon Bones  
Chloranthy Ring+2 is easily acquired  
Ring of Blades +1 is fine for this build  
Third Dragon Ring is best for this  
Last ring can replaced by Covenant, I use Giant during Blue Sentinel  
duels to increase my poise (tested, has positive effects)  
Alonne Greatbow because this build is for NG, although can be carried to NG+  
Using Greatbow is good for invasions at range strikes and also  
switching it up with your opponent when you get distance  
Greatbow can be replaced by other ranged options that aren't magic  
Black Dragon armor is light and thankfully only takes 20 dragon scales  
  
Strategy is more geared toward rolling than blocking for defense  
You are also advised to be more aggressive and on the attack rather than defending and waiting

[](/file/Dark-Souls-2/Maskodon.jpg)  
Starting Class - Knight  
Penal Mask - Avaliable after Lost Sinner boss fight in Sinner's Rise. Raises Equipment load.  
Mastodon Set (Excluding Helm) - Avaliable from Primal Warriors in Drangleic Castle. Offers extremely high protection.  
Blossom Kite Shield - Stamina Recovery. IT'S WHAT YOU NEED.  
Zweihander - Chaos Infusion may have died, but the Zweihander lives on. You can either put Fire or Lightning on this, but personally, I like Lightning better.  
REMEMBER TO ALWAYS TWO HAND YOUR ZWEI. THE SHIELD IS ONLY THERE FOR STAMINA.  
What rings you got *****?  
Chloranthy Ring +2 - Even more Stamina Recovery. Had to look up on a few wiki spots to see if this stacks, and apparently does. Lots of Stamina all the time.  
Third Dragon Ring - Health, Stamina, Equipment Load - IT'S THE NEW RING OF FAVOR AND PROTECTION WITHOUT THE*****TY BREAKING.  
Ring of Blades +2 - Damage, since now we have four ring slots instead of two. Putting more power behind your Zwei.  
Ring of Giants +2 - This increases your poise, which with Dark Souls 2's famous stunlock of death, makes it harder to stunlock you and allows you to just carry through your opponents swings to let you TRASH them.

### Description

It's a simple cosplay, the build is really solid.  
  
First of, you have to get the second reward of the [dragon's covenant](/Dragon+Remnants "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Remnants").  
Then, get a [claymore](/Claymore "Dark Souls 2 Claymore"), once you done it +10, [infuse it flames](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff"), when you done this part, (skip all of this if you're on ng+)you have to bonfire all the intere areas of [The Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"), when you have done everything, go back and fight again the [Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner").  
Done this again, you will need a "[fragrant branch of yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore")", now go back and use it on [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis"), he will be petrified on the second floor of the last bonfire before the Lost Sinner.  
Now, trade [the Old Witch](/Old+Witch+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Old Witch Soul") Soul and 10,000 (10k) of your souls and get the[flame weapons](/Flame+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Flame Weapon").  
Now, I use [the chloranthy ring+2](/Chloranthy+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Chloranthy Ring"),[southern ritual band ring +2](/Southern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Southern Ritual Band"), [ring of steel protection +2](/Ring+of+Steel+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Steel Protection") [and the third dragon's ring](/Third+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Third Dragon Ring").  
The duel strategy it's basically on roll and attack, little jump, rotation hit, but take in your mind you have 30 ADP if you timing you can roll against him when he use a slash, and that will be a 100% sure hit.  
And ofcourse before the duel use the flame weapons.

### Description

A lower level PvP build that uses the Bell Keepers covenant for PvP. The entire build can be ready to go in 3-4 hours for newer players, but faster than that if you're already familiar with the game.  
The build uses a Magic Zweihander as the primary weapon, which is then buffed with Magic Weapon, before 2-handing and mauling your opponents. Most opponents at this level / soul memory range will die in 1 or 2 hits to this build. It's a very high risk and high reward build.

### Primary Stats

### Description

Theory build on Dark Pyromancy Flame, which is an elitist weapon since it scales with hollowing, however it does offer a better scaling than the default Pyromancy Flame, this is an attempt to put the flame to full potential by overclocking the stat with Soul Vessel and Curse, once Red Tearstone Ring is activated, it may deal a formidable damage, twice as damaging as default Pyromancy Flame per hit?  
  
Feel free to leave comments on the page to tell whether it work or not. (Warning: elitist experimental build)

  * DEX 20

### Description

This build is supposed to be pure melee, unless you are willing to farm spices. 15 intelligence and faith works for chameleon (fun in pvp) and heal if that is necessary as a phantom. If you are good at rolling and have decent timing, this build will wreck just about everything pretty easily.  
**Starting**  
Starting class - any, but preferably warrior/knight if you are not willing to use a soul vessel. Determine starting gift yourself - i like to use petrified something.  
**Armor**  
Fully upgraded Faraam helm, kings armor, havels leggings and gauntlets. Upgrade as much as possible, of course. Early game drangleic and Vengarl also works. All offer great defense. The differences are just about negligible. Use what looks cooler to you.  
**Weapons**  
Right hand: Bastard or mastadon or claymore - greatswords scale more off strength (Dex is awful in ds2) and are still faster and lighter than ultra greatswords/halberds/clubs as well as staffs if you are going to use them (though as mentioned, not for attacking - only for healing/ chameleon)  
Left hand: Any shield with 100 phys defense, as long as you maintain under 70% capacity. If you have plenty to spare i recommend magic shield+magic imbuement for avoiding pesky spell-spammers. A parrying dagger is also nice to have if you are facing a great-sword wielding tank. If not fighting a mage, any crossbow at all will work wonders.  
**Rings**  
3rd dragon ring, old leo ring (if claymore - works well - if not, ring of blades), old soldier ring +1(or ring of blades if plenty VIT to spare) , chloranthy ring +1  
**HOW TO WIN:**  
If you meet a caster - switch to magic magic shield and close the distance until you can heavy attack with claymore - guaranteed to do a lot of damage if fully upgraded with leo ring  
If you meet a tank(full havel using heavy weapons) roll and block until his stamina is just about gone, try to move in for a backtab - if not, use a crossbow with some good bolts (if he is not using shield) if he is using a shield, circle around with shield up and wait for opportunity to backstab  
If you meet any medium melee build/ a hybrid of caster and melee - keep your physical shield and try to roll away if he tries to attack you with a spell. Then keep him at range by using heavy attack.  
**IMPORTANT:**  
When you win, spam "very good" carving

Spells: Great Heal / Great Lightning Spear (x2 or 1 + WOG) / Great Magic Barrier / Great Fireball / Fire Tempest / Flame Weapon / Toxic Mist / Flame Swathe  
The main tactic of this build is this: use flame weapon on the uchigatana and switch to blacksteel on left hand. Use power stance and make use of rolling, occasionally using spells for extra damage. Toxic Mist works wonderfully as both a poison and a sight-blocking barrier to fire lightning spears from behind. Pyro flame is in left hand so you can buff the right hand and switch to pyromancy without losing the buff. If prefered, use sunlight blade to buff the left hand and use miracles as secondaries. The shield gives very good defense against most types of damage at +10 and imbuing it with magic brings the magic and fire defense to around 75 while keeping the physical at 98.

  * ATN: 13 (2 slot min, 1 slot if you don't want a ranged spell)
  * STR: 25 (I really like Avelyn, although it's pretty much unneeded in this build. If you don't want this, mine would be 16 for King's Shield.)
  * Dex: 25 (Minimum stat requirements for Chaos Blade, adjust this with your weapon of choice.)
  * ADP: 36 (Gotta get that Agility)
  * INT: 1 We love the mentally challenged Bandit Class. (If you want Dex/Int obviously you'd swap around the stats you pour into faith and your starting class.)
  * FTH: 60 (This is your max stat)

### Description

Basically you're a hyper aggressive weapon buffer, 1 ranged spell thrown in to deal with those pesky Int/Hex builds. This pretty much revolves around being an in your face melee monster, spam the crap out of the Katana sprinting poke for huge, unexpected damage. Chaos Blade has fast, low swings on RB meaning you'll often hit targets as they come out of their roll. Dexterity damage scaling (~70 damage more at 40 DEX with an A scaling? From pls.) is thrown out of the window for enormous Lightning scaling from that Faith pump.

So this is a build I've been having a lot of fun with. I keep him at SL25 and get TONS of action with the Bell Keepers. Feel free to interpret and change according to your style, but here's the idea-  
I hated the swordsman on my first play, but I decided to revisit him. I pumped dex to 29, and str is at 9. Alvaa set (all +9) with wanderer manchettes +9 for armor, until I beefed up Creighton's set to +9 (has a bit more defense but less poise-you decide). Still using Manchettes though, ok defense and light weight.

Tower shield handy but not required a shield with good stability will do fine.  
If seeking a mixed build as in Spell-sword highly suggest Blue flame which can be obtained in the Un-dead Crypt.

### Description

All right guys, it's time to get down to business. This builds theme is to crush and maim your sissy opponents in the manliest way possible. And the best way to do that is by looking swagger as hell while you show them their entrails. The Rings and Weapons are up to the individual, but personally I go for a strength build with this set. Standard STR weps and great shield's to bash your targets skull in. Disorientate the foe by constantly applying poison thanks to your magic fairy dust. Keeping up a good offence is key with this set because one hit on the princess leaves her open to attack from all manner of nasty suitors. Show the world you arn't just a helpless princess. Cut, stab, and slam your enemies like the foreign scum they are. Show your dominance as the Fairy Princess and protect your lands as the next heir to the throne.

### Primary Stats

Click on Build Name for details.

### Description

This is a PVP build that revolves around the tactic of not only pressuring your opponent with whippy status conditions, but looking absolutely fabulous while doing so!  
It's recommended to upgrade you DEX as high as it will possibly go (for extra bonuses to poison and bleed). Once you're there feel free to upgrade your stats as you see fit (personally i use Faith as well for extra lightning speary fun).  
Suggested Equipment is the full Moon Butterfly Armor, but you may wish to sub the headgear for the King's Crown for that ultimate Royal Look!  
As for Weapons, you will need the Spotted and Notched Whips and you must Fully Upgrade them. These will be your bread and butter for the build. You could also use Dual fist weapons for keeping close for the poison effect.  
Rings should include the Third Dragon ring for the HP and Stamina. The Crest of Blood for Bleed attack, the Rat Crest for Poison attack, and then another ring you want to wear (ring of Blades is a good idea for an attack boost).  
The main aim of the build is to Dual wield your whips and pressure your opponents at a slightly comfortable range. If the opponent tries to move away, dash forward and use a running attack, as this will put you in close and will hit anyone going sideways. The poison pressure from the armor should heal keep opponents wary of approaching too closely, allowing you to whip away at their sheilds to inflict some tasty bleed and poison.

  * VGR: 40 (This will give you a steady HP pool without experiencing much of a drop off)
  * END: 20 (The soft cap for stamina is 20, after that it becomes expensive maintaining a higher stamina)
  * VIT: 30 (Getting to 29 for the equipment load is essential if you want to use heavier armour, I went with 30 for a nice even number.)
  * ATN: 10 (This allows you one slot for magic)
  * STR: 20 (Soft cap for strength, allows some versatility for weapons and shields)
  * DEX: 60 (While 40 Dex is essential for this build, I find that boosting Dex to 60 helps with your bleed and poison bonuses, which is necessary here)
  * ADP: 10 (It isn't necessary to raise your ADP for this build, but I found that a couple extra points is helpful)
  * INT: 10 (This allows you to cast basic spells)
  * FTH: 5 (Leave at default. Faith is unecessary for the mercenary, you rely on yourself and not a higher power right?!)

### Description

Strengths: Your biggest strength is your aggressive attacks. Your high DEX and moderate STR in conjunction with the status effects from your weapons makes you a ferocious melee attacker. You can utilize your bow to do substantial damage as well, provided you time your shots. You will have speed and time on your side, provided you properly poison enemies and dodge attacks. Your fast attacks and status effects will keep your enemies on the defense, and your moderate reach will allow you to play close or medium range with some versatility. You have the defense and health to take hits, but you have the flexibility to avoid them entirely. You are not a heavy tank, but you aren't a glass cannon either. Use your high damage output to charge and destroy magic users, use your speed and status effects to outmaneuver tanks. Against tanks with high Adaptibility, you will still be able to take advantage of your high damage and speed, just be patient and time your rolls. Lure them into an attack and work your way behind them, or let them drain their stamina and counter. You have a high versatility with your weapons, you can keep everyone on their toes by switching between sword/shield, dual swords, whips, bow. Keep the enemy on the defensive and you can widdle them down 90% of the time, make them fear lowering their shield or opening up for an attack. Keep mages close, they aren't a threat if they don't have time to use their spells. Use magic weapon to take advantage of melee fighters who lack proper magical defense.  
Weaknesses: Let's be honest with ourselves, there is no such thing as a perfect build. Everyone is going to be better in some way. Your biggest and most glaring weakness is going to be your lack of offensive spells. If you set yourself up properly, you can avoid damage from fire, poison, curse, or magic provided you know what you're facing in advance, though that is rarely the case. If you don't know, try to anticipate. I typically keep my magic defense higher as the biggest threat for me is longer ranges. Since pyromancy has more close range spells, it is easier to counter (though devastating if you fail) A low Adaptability means you may suffer the same fate that you're trying to inflict on others, fortunately your high attack and moderate defense can often counter people who try to poison you to death. The last flaw is timing. You have several weapons and if you're caught with the wrong one at the wrong time it can lead to a quick departure, make sure you work on your timing. Keep your weapons ready for each scenario and keep rolling. You're faster than almost everyone else, whether you're smarter or not is debatable.

This build was made based on my own understanding of the game, stats, mechanics and whatever made sense at the time. In my estimate, I can say that the build was finished 3/4 into the game, it was wrecking things 3/8 into the game.  
It is a monster in both PvE and PvP provided you know how to handle it.

### Description

This build is all about dealing massive amounts of damage in versatile ways and looking cool while doing it. The stats are set up to support the two most important spells for this build, Resonant Weapon and Great Resonant Soul. The most of important piece of equipment you can have is your weapon and your catalyst. For this build I chose the Chaos Blade katana. The damage is amazing and the drawback is minimal for pvp. The running R1 attack of the katanas is incredible and this one is no different.The moveset is amazing and my favorite of the katanas. Infuse this with the Dark Infusion. The catalyst I use is the Dark Caitha's Chime plus 10 with dark infusion. One in each hand so you can buff as well as cast GRS from either hand.  
Recap of all Equipment  
Weapon - Dark Chaos Blade plus 5  
Catalysts - 2 Dark Caitha's Chimes plus 5, one in each hand  
Bow - Dark Hunter's Blackbow plus 5. Great utility bow with great damage.  
Shield - Llwellyn Shield plus 5  
Rings - Chloranthy Ring plus 2, Clear Bluestone Ring plus 2, Ring of Blades plus 2, Third Dragon Ring.  
Now for the Fashion Souls. The outfit is made to look intimidating as well as sweet. Everything matches well together and looks pretty mean on male or female characters.  
Head - Mad Warriors Helm plus 5 or Penal Helm plus 5  
Torso - Executioner Armor plus 5  
Hands - Engraved Gauntlets plus 5. Looks great and causes critical hits on regular attack every now and then, which is great for a fast weapon like the Chaos Blade  
Legs - Bone King Skirt plus 5  
This build is super aggressive. Bait rolls and chase them down with the running R1 attack. I try to keep things strictly melee and chase down runners with GRS or switch when all hope is lost. I use poison daggers and holy water urns for consumables. The weight of this build is at exactly 70% so there isn't a lot of wiggle room. If you don't like the soul loss so much, drop your attunement to 16 and attune Dark Weapon instead of Resonant Weapon. This spell lasts 15 seconds longer in a fight which is nice and you can pump your points into Vit if you wanted some more equipment / heavier gear or into dex for slightly more physical damage to compensate for the weaker buff . The damage from this buff is quite a bit less . I've had tremendous success with this build and hope you can wreck some people with it. Enjoy!

### Description

Your goal is to master almost every spell class, and the physical weaponry.  
Head piece: Black Witch Hat (for an extra attunement).  
Rest of the body: Heavy Armor of your choice, Though I suggest Vengarl's set.  
Main Weapon: Pursuer Great Sword +5 (or something similar).  
Secondary Weapon: Black Witch Staff.  
Tertiary Weapon: Pyromancy Flame +10  
Main Weapon (left): Pursuer Shield  
Secondary Weapon (left): Dragonrider Bow +5  
Ring 1: Life Ring  
Ring 2: Ring of Blades +2  
Ring 3: Third Dragon Ring  
Ring 4: Southern Ritual Band +2  
Spells:

  * Crystal Soul Spear
  * Soul Geyser
  * Crystal Homing Soul Mass
  * Lightning Spear
  * Great Lightning Spear
  * Great Resonant Sou;
  * Scraps of Life
  * Life Drain Patch
  * Flame Swathe
  * Forbidden Sun
  * Climax
  * Climax should only be used if fire is not good against a certain boss, or you want to highly damage something, this is more for Player Vs. Boss.Note: You'll notice that by the time this build is finished, it will still be slightly easy to level up. Once this happens, level up whatever you want or need, perhaps to max out your physical weapon stat, or add more HP or whatever. You'll also need a lot of Simpleton's/Skeptic's Spice for Soul Geyser and Climax.

### Description

Check the [Build Page](/DJL2+Brawler "Dark Souls 2 DJL2 Brawler") for details, strategy, etc.  
Weapons and Armor are up to preference, but the goal is to go heavy on both to maximize up close damage.  
After initial stat investment, build to:

  * VGR: 40-45+ (once you reach the point of diminishing returns on weapon/spell stats, VGR and ADP are where to spend)
  * END: 20 (leaving END low requires more care towards stamina management, but is workable)
  * VIT: 30-33+ (this is hugely dependent on the rings you wear and your desired mobility - armor should be Alonne Knight or heavier)
  * ATT: 10 (with Southern Ritual band, you can select an attack, a buff and a heal or a combination for utility and versatility)
  * STR: 30-35+ (UGS love strength, but the lighter weapons - greatsword, katana, curved greatsword - tend to be more versatile)
  * DEX: 38+ (enough to dual wield [Blacksteel Katana](/Blacksteel+Katana "Dark Souls 2 Blacksteel Katana") if that's your thing, or just help scaling on DEX based damage)
  * ADP: 25+ (take it when you can afford it)
  * INT: 12+ (this allows use of [Black Knight Greatsword](/Black+Knight+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Black Knight Greatsword") \- can be tweaked for access to buffs, utility spells, or other weapons)
  * FAI: 22-36+ (even on a NG play through, this is enough for good healing/utility miracles, helps fire/lightning bonuses)

### Description

Build Notes:

  1. 30% equipment load for fastest roll.
  2. 61 equipment load (points) for good Flynn's Ring Damage
  3. Power stance Mytha's Bent Blades for Toxic buildup. I think you can stunlock opponents who have zero poise (needs verification)
  4. Equip Dark Drift (it weights just 3 units) and strong attack through shields.
  5. Uses Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring to make backstabbing easier.
  6. Needs Southern Ritual Band +2 so you can equip spells. You can also ditch this ring if you don't care about pyromancy.
  7. Ring of Blades +2 stacks with backstabbing (Flynn's ring does not add backstabbing damage or so I've read)

Ring+2

  * Is varied, it does not change much the sword attack, for having the lowest str and dex.

### Description

Build Notes:

  1. Rings: Ring of faith (+5 faith), Ring of intelligence (+5 intelligence), ring of attunement (extra attunement slot), (whatever you want)
  2. Wear: You want to be wearing very heavy armor, like havels without the head. With these stats you should be under 70% so you can still move fast
  3. You'll need a shield (any one you prefer (med))
  4. You'll need a good dark casting staff like the sunset staff (infused with dark, all leveled up) PUT IN LEFT HAND
  5. You'll need a good dark casting chime like chime of want (infused with dark, all leveled up) PUT IN RIGHT HAND
  6. You'll need these hexes equipped: Great resonent soul, profound still, scraps of life, affinity
  7. Have a katana or some weapon in your right hand just in case (I use a poison manslayer +5)
  8. Have a good amount of souls on you

Combat:  
When invading someone's world, first use profound still to make sure they can't use magic, immediately cast affinity.  
Now, get great resonent soul ready. Run towards your opponent until your affinity orbs all fire off, a second after they fire off, cast a great resonent soul. The trick here is that they will roll to miss the orbs, but get hit by your great resonent soul after the roll animation completes, this should take a good chunk of health.  
At this point, cast scraps of life and cast affinity again.  
Rinse and repeat.  
Note: This build is all about timing, if the resonent soul is not cast at the right time, it can be easily dodged.  
Enjoy! :)

  * Class: [Warrior](/Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Warrior") or [Knight](/Knight "Dark Souls 2 Knight")

### Description

Head: Warlock Mask +10  
Smelter Set +5 for armor, legs and gauntlets.  
  
Right Hand: Fire Black Knight Ultra Greatsword +5, Fire Sun sword +10  
Left Hand:(Dark) Pyromancy Flame +10  
  
Rings: Chloranthy Ring+2, Third Dragon Ring, Ring of Blades+2, Southern Ritual Band+2  
Spells: Flame Weapon, Great Combustion, Great FireBall (or Warmth).  
  
This build is very fun to play against any melee opponent thanks to the BK Ultra Greatsword nice move set, it has high damage and quite good defense. Facing caster builds can be much more difficult as you do not have so much stamina to close up while dodging spells and be able to strike when in range. Stay mobile, use jump attack against parry spammer, bait easily with Backstep + R2, you can trade damage easily as you will almost always deal more damage in one swing than your opponent (and might also stagger them). When you manage to hit with your R1, do not swing more than twice as the second hit will not stagger and the third swing will be dodged 90% of the time. When you hit with a R2 or running attack, follow with a Great Combustion as a waking attack.  
  
Note 1: I am actually playing this build on SL 230 with a lot more END and VIT to have more stamina and be able to carry anti cast shield (Magic Magic Shield and Dark Transgressor Leather Shiled) as well as a Magic Dragon Rider bow +5 (OP Damage) against runner and healer.  
  
Note 2: This build can also be done with a Cleric, changing Southern Ritual Band for Soldier's Ring and switching some VIT point into ATT.

  * Spell 3: Firestorm

This build was not really hard (not at all) and it fits both PvP and PvE prefectly and as you see it is str and dex oriented build . Saber is one of my favorite anime characters , if you are into anime you must know her or even heard about , the hardest thing to do was to find good armor pieces that fit the cosplay and I couldn't find something better than the throne watcher armor (excluding the head gear for cosplay purposes) also decided to max out Dranglic sword and use magic weapon with it (for cosplay purposes too) , however when it comes to pvp I start switching to grand lance (which is also maxed) , if you are good with backstabs and rolling (duh) this should be one of the greatest builds for you.  
Note 1: You can notice that the Strength has 1 extra point , this point should have gone to the vitality but it was a mistake and did not really feel like wasting a soul vessel for it  
Note 2 : This was made on the scholar of the first sin version  
Note 3 : currently trying the build on NG+ and it's super effective (well until now)
