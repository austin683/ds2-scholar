### Mirrah Lore

Mirrah is a land perennially beset by unrest, and in the old capital of Mirrah, an ancient, well-protected spring produces holy water, but the water has been difficult to acquire ever since Mirrah became embroiled in war. The knights of Mirrah wore distinct [chainmail](/Creighton's+Chainmail "Dark Souls 2 Creighton's Chainmail") with a stag insignia on a blue field, while the common foot soldiers of Mirrah wore light [leather armor](/Cale's+Leather+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Cale's Leather Armor"). Mirrah's official order of elite knights however wore unique [vestments](/Lucatiel's+Vest "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel's Vest") and were issued a [shield](/Mirrah+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Mirrah Shield") that was a symbol of the greatest knights' strength and willingness to give their lives for their country. They were also given a ceremonial [hat](/Mirrah+Hat "Dark Souls 2 Mirrah Hat") and wielded the [Mirrah Greatsword](/Mirrah+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Mirrah Greatsword") which demands advanced skill in a rare and unique sword technique. [Magic Barrier](/Magic+Barrier "Dark Souls 2 Magic Barrier") was favored amongst the wizard knights of Mirrah. The knights of Mirrah are expected to fight honorably, with reliance only upon swordsmanship. They only resort to magic the only time they truly need it: to face the magic of an enemy. According to [Lucatiel](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah"); "_our land of Mirrah is surrounded by enemies, and constantly at war. There is only one way up in Mirrah. Join the Order, and prove yourself in battle. My family had little fortune, and no name. I had to carve out a piece of the world for myself...with two things. My sword, and my loyalty to my Lord_ ". It is common to hear of a peasant's dream of striving for knighthood as an escape from hardship, but who would ever think it possible?

In Mirrah, the land of knights, there exists also an order of [shadow knights](/Nimble+Shadow "Dark Souls 2 Nimble Shadow") who carry out assassinations in the cover of darkness. These shadow knights quietly carry out unspeakable tasks and those who are especially adept assassins are often hired as bodyguards. In an attempt to stave off the curse, [King Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") hired these shadowmen to put down the Hollows, but before long they were Hollowed themselves. Geisteel was a precious alloy created in the easter land of Mirrah, its composition long kept secret from foreign lands. That is, until [Chancellor Wellager](/Chancellor+Wellager "Dark Souls 2 Chancellor Wellager") was ordered by King Vendrick to grant the gifted blacksmith Llewellyn a lifetime contract, whatever the cost, in order to introduce the rare alloy to Drangleic. The [Llewellyn Set](/Llewellyn+Set "Dark Souls 2 Llewellyn Set"), [Llewellyn Shield](/Llewellyn+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Llewellyn Shield"), [Espada Ropera](/Espada+Ropera "Dark Souls 2 Espada Ropera"), and [Royal Dirk](/Royal+Dirk "Dark Souls 2 Royal Dirk") were all made from this fine metal. [Cale the Cartographer](/Cale+the+Cartographer "Dark Souls 2 Cale the Cartographer") claims [Creighton the Wanderer](/Creighton+the+Wanderer "Dark Souls 2 Creighton the Wanderer") to be an infamous killer, a 'knight' in name alone who shortly before his execution managed to escape to Drangleic. In _Dark Souls 3_ it is said that Creighton was a dishonorable deserter who wore the Mirrah chainmail most religiously. [Benhart's Set](/Benhart's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Benhart's Set") is most similar to the armor worn by the knights of Mirrah, so it is likely that he obtained the armor there while wandering land to land. _Dark Souls 3_ would also further corroborate that [Benhart's Parma](/Benhart's+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Benhart's Parma") is from Mirrah.

### Dialogue Related to Mirrah

#### [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah")

_Phew... Heh heh. You are an odd one. Normally, people keep a safe distance when they see this mask. But you... I am called Lucatiel. From the land of Mirrah, to the far east, across the mountains. They say Drangleic brims with powerful souls. And so I came to claim my share. But what a strange place...Even the rumours did not prepare me._

_Our land of Mirrah is surrounded by enemies, and constantly at war. There is only one way up in Mirrah. Join the Order, and prove yourself in battle. My family had little fortune, and no name. I had to carve out a piece of the world for myself...with two things. My sword, and my loyalty to my Lord._

_I had an older brother. We learned to fence together. He became the most decorated swordsman in all of Mirrah. I never even compared to him. In fact, I never beat him, not once. But then, one day...he was gone, lost without a trace. Now I'm certain. That he was taken, by the curse._

I joined forces with a man on the way, but he was no more than a back-stabbing knave. He took the first chance he had to try and off me.

Well...I think he looked rather similar... N-no, it's true! I saw just such a man, I swear! I believe his name was...Cr...Cr...err Cray-something...I believe... They shared...some resemblance, I...I think..._
