**Great Chaos Fireball** is a [Pyromancy](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Great Chaos Fireball** , born from the Chaos Flame that consumed the mother of pyromancy. Summons a chaos flame, flinging it at foes. This unique flame triggers a brief eruption of molten lava upon impact. [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") are offensive fire spells that do not demand [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith") or [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") prerequisites and can be executed with a [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") or [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame"). The fire damage scales with [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"), yet there are no specific stat requirements for casting pyromancies. However, opponents resistant to fire damage remain unaffected by [Pyromancy Spells](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies").

> This special flame creates a short-lived surge of molten lava wherever it lands."

### Great Chaos Fireball Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * After throwing a great chaos fireball a pool of lava lingers on the spot of impact doing massive fire damage to enemies who decide to stick around too long.
  * The immediate damage of this spell (impact + explosion) is the most powerful of all pyromancies, dealing roughly 50% more damage than [Great Fireball](/Great+Fireball "Dark Souls 2 Great Fireball").
  * Same range and speed (cast time is approximately the same as [Fire Tempest](/Fire+Tempest "Dark Souls 2 Fire Tempest")) as the basic [Fireball](/Fireball "Dark Souls 2 Fireball") but does more damage than the [Forbidden Sun](/Forbidden+Sun "Dark Souls 2 Forbidden Sun") with a larger area splash and lava that lingers longer (lava is not affected by the [Lingering Dragoncrest Ring](/Lingering+Dragoncrest+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Lingering Dragoncrest Ring")).
  * Since this pyromancy is difficult to dodge and has high damage with a wide AoE, it is arguably the best pyromancy for PvP. It is recommended that you wait until your opponent approaches and time the cast so you throw it at your feet, even if you miss your opponent either must back up or be damaged by the lingering lava.
