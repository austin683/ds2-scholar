Despite lacking any inherent special properties, the prism stone can be utilized as a path marker if you feel you may lose your way.

### Dark Souls 2 Prism Stone Usage

  * Can be used to mark a path, or to see whether or not a fall is fatal.
  * Can be traded for lowest tier items with [Dyna & Tillo](/Dyna+and+Tillo "Dark Souls 2 Dyna and Tillo") in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt").

### Prism Stone Location in Dark Souls 2

  * x10 Sold by [Sweet Shalquoir](/Sweet+Shalquoir "Dark Souls 2 Sweet Shalquoir") for 300 souls each.
  * This stock becomes unlimited once the player reaches Drangleic Castle.
  * Dropped by [Spider Drone](/Spider+Drone "Dark Souls 2 Spider Drone")

### DKS2 Prism Stone Tips

  * Using these in the Rat King Covenant can draw a gray phantom's attention with clever use. Either activate the item to give off the colorful effect or 'Leave' one somewhere to trick greedy players.
  * Once the stone hits the ground, it will play one of two sounds- the soft tone meaning it's a survivable fall, or the blaring sound meaning a drop to your death.
  * When used, these stones will only reset if the player exits the game, dies, uses a homeward bone, or teleports to another area (basically, after any loading screen). Resting at a bonfire will not cause this and they will last indefinitely.

### Prism Stone Notes

  * Dyna & Tillo will not accept stacked stones. You may stand in the nest, select "Leave" and drop them individually to receive a reward. You may drop many individual stones one at a time and receive all the rewards at once.
  * You will always receive a reward of the same or a greater tier value.
  * Unlike the counterpart in _Dark Souls_ , this one has a maximum cap to prevent lagging, 30 prisms at max.
