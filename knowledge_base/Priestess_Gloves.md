### Priestess Gloves Description

"Robe worn by Drangleic clerics."  
"The clerics of Drangleic have retained their status throughout the ages, but were always at arms length from the royal family, as if their existence was little more than a formality."  
"It is customary for clerics to wear different garb depending on their area, but the reason for this practice is unknown...  
This is a woman's robe."
