### DS2 Yorgh's Ring Tips and Notes

  * This ring gives all your actions ( attacks, spell casts, parrying, rolling, even drinking estus ) spell parry frames. Meaning, for example if you time an attack just right, you could hit the spell with your weapon and reflect it.
  * This ring also has a chance to deflect the projectiles from the Moonlight Greatsword, Drakewing Ultra Greatsword, and the Ice Rapiers strong attacks.
  * The rings durability will only go down with the automatic spell parries and will NOT go down when using an actually parry. (L2 parry)
  * If the ring parries a spell while you are using a Homeward Bone/Aged Feather you will complete the animation uninterrupted, but you will not teleport to the last bonfire.
  * Testing in the Shrine of Amana with multiple Amana Priestess' projectiles at once over the course of ~1 hour, the spell parry is almost certainly 50% (sample size of 2756 shots with 1374 automatically parried).
  * Interesting effects: If used together with the Immolation pyromancy, it has a much higher chance of reflecting spells.
