### King's Gauntlets Description

"Guantlets of Vendrick, King of Drangleic.

What makes a king?  
Some say that it is birthright, while others call it destiny.

Perhaps it is not important, as long as the king's name serves to unite his people."

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Collect from [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana") treasure. After [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick"), go to the left wall and you would see a locked wooden door.

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
