**Dark Leggings** is a **Legging** and a part of [Dark Set](/Dark+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Dark Leggings Description

_"Leggings of a knight subsumed by dark._  
_No one knows the true identity of these men who are said to freely manipulate dark. Old foreign legends describe them as poor souls who chased the lost art of life drain."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Obtaining the full set requires getting the [King's Ring](/King%27s+Ring) and progressing to [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep).

  * The Gauntlets can be obtained in a [mimic](/mimic) chest in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak). Right before the boss fight with Mytha, there is a small staircase leading up. To the left, there is an NPC invader. To the right there is a room blocked by poison pots. Break the pots and proceed. The room is filled with enemies that produce poison gas, so have some moss ready. The mimic chest will be in the room.

  * The Leggings can be obtained when first entering [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros). Before the first bonfire, there will be a mastadon and dwarf. Dispose of them. To the right of the passage leading to the bonfire, there is a  _**mimic**_ chest.

  * The Armor can be obtained in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep). Travel to the second bonfire, proceed to cross the platform above the lava (where the guy normally smashes the bridge) and enter the room filled with falling platforms. Pull the lever to lower the platform into the lava, then follow go up the stairs and along the platforms to the ladder that has been decended. Climb up, and a ** _mimic_** will be directly to your right. Also, if you continue to go up, the [Black Knight Greataxe](/Black+Knight+Greataxe) can be found.

  * The Mask can be obtained after opening the gate in the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods) that requires the King's Ring (Aldia's Keep). Do not go inside the building. Instead, go to the left. There is a wood hut with a bonfire. Behind the hut to the left, there is a ** _mimic_** containing the mask. There are enemies nearby, but they are not hostile. Leaving them alone is ideal, for they can petrify you.

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite)
  * The Mask has a hidden effect that gives +1 int and +1 faith(confirmed)
