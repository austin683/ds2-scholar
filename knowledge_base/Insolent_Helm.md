_"Helmet worn by once-proud clerics.__Relics of a party who long ago attempted to conquer the Undead Crypt._

_For this sin their deaths have been postponed, so they may serve as crypt sentries."_

### Location

  * Bought from [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne), in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt).
  * Costs 5400/9000/6300/7200 souls
  * In the Scholar of the First Sin release of the game, it is no longer available for purchase from [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne). Instead, you can only acquire this from red phantoms appearing after you light the sconce below the shortcut bridge in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt). It should be noted that the drops are not guaranteed and therefore it's advised that the player equip any drop rate enhancing items before fighting the phantoms.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Insolent Set](/Insolent+Set). 
    * This is the same armor worn by the armored skeletons in the Skeleton Lord fight.
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Ores).
  * Increases [Faith](/Faith) by 2+.
