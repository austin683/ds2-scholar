**Sanctum Soldier** is an [enemy](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. The **Sanctum Soldiers** , remnants of a kingdom from ancient times, once formed the main military force under the rule of the 'Sunken King.' The toxic miasma from Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon, has twisted and warped their high-quality equipment, and their flesh and bones have decayed over countless years of hollowing. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Sanctum Soldier Information

_Soldiers that constituted the main military force which served under the rule of the "Sunken King" in a long forgotten kingdom from eons past._

_Their once_ high quality _equipment has been twisted and warped by the toxic miasma ejected from Sinh the Slumbering dragon, whilst their flesh and bones have rotted and degraded over the course of countless years of hollowing. These once proud defenders of a magnificent kingdom have now been reduced to almost mindless sentries of a crumbling ruin but; even still, their loyalty to defend has not wavered and they will not tolerate perceived threats to their land._

### Sanctum Soldier Strategy Tips in DKS2

  * I recommend circling around with a shield with high physical and poison such as the Red Rush Shield and simply backstabbing.
  * Due to their high Poise rating, it is recommended that you use the Stone Ring against them.
  * They are pretty easy to parry. So; bait, parry and laugh.
  * Keep your distance during the spinning attack.

### Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier Move Set

  * Jumping Smash _(2H-Mace)_ : Leaps a medium distance and brings the mace down in an overhead smash. Roll to the sides, don't bother parrying. Can be blocked.
  * Two-hit-combo _(2H-Mace)_ : Uses their mace in two forward swings, the first going **DOWNWARD** , and the second sweeping **HORIZONTALLY**. Can be blocked and parried, though the timing if the latter is rather hard to nail.
  * Lance Charge _(1H-Lance)_ : Sprints forwards with their lance raised, inflicting multiple damage procs, similar to the player's lance 1-hand strong-attack. Can be blocked, but the multiple and consecutive hits means you're stamina will be taking a huge beating. Parrying is unreliable to impossible. (In experience, others might find parrying them perfectly manageable.) If you **do** manage to dodge backward fast enough, the charge leaves them vulnerable at the end. Prime time for free hits.
  * Lance Jab  _(1H-Lance)_ : Simple forward lance jab once. Can be blocked and parried.
  * Shoot Arrows _(__Archer_ _)_ : Shoots arrows at the player from a distance. Deals Poison damage. Will switch to a sword when the player approaches them.

### Sanctum Soldier Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * **EVERY****VARIANT** of the Sanctum Soldiers inflict Poison damage with all of their attacks, and are also immune to Poison themselves.
  * Some Sanctum Soldiers in the [Dragon Sanctum](/Dragon's+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon's Sanctum") appear to have a cloud of Poison surrounding them. This is like a Poison-version of [Immolation](/Immolation "Dark Souls 2 Immolation"), deals poison damage in melee range. Soldiers outside in the open dont seem to have this aura, only the ones inside the Sanctum do.
  * They **CAN** heal with [Estus flasks](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask") if you retreat mid-combat, so be wary. 
  * Insane elemental resistances, but they seem to have their Dark resistance lower than others. If melee isn't an option, [hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes") are your next best option.
