**Throne Watcher Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
_"Helm/Armor/Gauntlets/Leggings worn by the Throne Watcher. Has high magic defense._   
_The Watcher waited by the throne for ages. Will all his waiting ever be rewarded?"_   
  
  
  
  

###  Set Location

  * Sold by [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer) (43,6k) once [Throne Watcher and Throne Defender](/Throne+Watcher+and+Throne+Defender) are defeated (spend 15k souls at Maughlin's shop to unlock boss armor sets).

  
  

###  Notes
