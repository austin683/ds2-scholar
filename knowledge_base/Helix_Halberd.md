**Helix Halberd** is a **[Halberds](/Halberds "Dark Souls 2 Halberds")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Helix Halberd **features a strong attack that executes a spear thrust, with the potential for increased damage when hitting with the tip. Holding the halberd with two hands and using the strong attack brings it behind the character before thrusting forward, ensuring effective hits even at close range.

### How to get Helix Halberd in Dark Souls 2

  * Treasure from the [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana"), Crumbled Ruins bonfire: Hug the left wall and you will find a Pharros' Lockstone on the ground underwater. Activate this lockstone to find a chest containing the halberd.

### DS2 Helix Halberd Hints and Tips

  * Strong attack is spear thrust.
  * Strong attack releases a small spear-like tip from inside of the halberd, when only hit with the tip the damage will increase slightly. If you manage to hit with the two blades on the top of the halberd and the spear tip the damage will amplify greatly. If you have full Flynn's Ring bonus, each hit does get the additional damage (extra 150 if hit right). Same with Ring of Blades.
  * Holding the Halberd with two hands and using the strong attack will bring your halberd behind your character, then they will thrust it in-front of them. Therefore even when an enemy is directly in-front of you it will always hit with the two blades. How ever you will still need to hit them at a distance to get the maximum damage for the spear will only come out at the end of the thrust.
  * Although it is a halberd class weapon, it is considered a spear when powerstancing. This means it can not be powerstanced with halberds/reapers/twinblades (excluding another Helix Halberd) but can be powerstanced with lances, spears, straight swords, curved swords, thrusting swords, katanas, and daggers. When powerstanced its special tip extends with both light and heavy attacks.
