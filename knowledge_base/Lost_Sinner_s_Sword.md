### DS2 Lost Sinner's Sword Hints and Tips

  * Reinforced with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5.
  * The rolling two-handed attack on this weapon is its only thrust move.
  * Attack Rating scales down with your [Sin](/sin "Dark Souls 2 sin") level, regardless of the weapon sinned with. 
    * At 30+ sin level the AR of the weapon will be 0 in the menu.
    * The AR of this weapon is not properly displayed in the menus, the sin scaling is not properly implemented so it does not affect the damage output in any significant manner.
    * A player can have their sin amount removed once per playthrough by [Cromwell the Pardoner](/Cromwell+the+Pardoner "Dark Souls 2 Cromwell the Pardoner"). It is advised to take care of certain [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") quests such as siding with [Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate")/[Creighton](/Creighton+the+Wanderer "Dark Souls 2 Creighton the Wanderer") before doing this.
  * Shares a moveset with the [Pursuer's Ultra Greatsword](/Pursuer%27s+Ultra+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer%27s Ultra Greatsword").
  * Reminiscent of the Lost Sinner's parry attack, this weapon has the quicker greatsword [parry](/Parry "Dark Souls 2 Parry") animation rather than that of other ultra greatswords.
  * This weapon benefits most from a Raw infusion due to its high base damage and poor scalings.
  * This weapon deals 30 damage to the player when hitting an enemy or a breakable object. 
    * This self damage CAN kill the player.
    * Hitting multiple objects\enemies in one swing will deal multiple instances of self damage.
    * Critical attacks such as Ripostes and Backstabs do not trigger self damage.
    * Hitting a blocking opponent does not deal self damage even if their shield doesn't fully block the hit, but if the attack kills the blocking opponent the user will receive self damage.
    * The self inflicted damage cannot be mitigated by [Blue Tearstone Ring](/Blue+Tearstone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Blue Tearstone Ring")
    * Self inflicted damage does not appear to interact with [Ring of Thorns](/Ring+of+Thorns "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Thorns") or [Old Sun Ring](/Old+Sun+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Old Sun Ring")
