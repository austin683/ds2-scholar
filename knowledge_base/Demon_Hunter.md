##  Build Strategy

**If you do not want to put as many points into ATN, then I suggest getting the +1 Southern Ritual band from Brightstone Cove Tseldora.**   
Based on the old legends of whip wielding demon hunters.   
High DPS Rogue/Spellsword hybrid good for dealing damage to single enemies and bosses. Good for PVP.   
if you want the old whip, put down your petrified something at Dyna and Tilo's nest in things betwixt. If it does not drop for you, re-roll your character until it does.   
The archdrake staff/chime can be bought from Felkin the Outcast after your int and faith reach 8   
Saints hood if you want to wear a headpiece, I prefer not to.
