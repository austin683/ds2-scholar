**Boss Soul Weapons** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are [Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") crafted from the souls dropped by [Bosses](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses") throughout the game. There are various weapons which can be constructed from the souls. You may also consume the Boss Souls if you wish, but they are best reserved for the construction of these unique weapons. You can trade the Boss Souls you've acquired to two different [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") namely [Straid](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis") and [Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex"). Each of them produces different types of Boss Soul Weapons often from the same Souls so it is important that you choose which NPC you'll trade in your Souls.

### How to get Boss Soul Weapons in DS2

**DS2 Boss Soul Weapons** and some [Spells](/Spells "Dark Souls 2 Spells") are acquired through trading. This involves giving an NPC a boss soul and getting a spell or piece of equipment in return, plus a soul fee for creating the spell/weapon. You do not need any of the base weapon types. There are two [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") who can be traded with for boss weapons, and each with their own inventories.

#### [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis")

  * ([The Lost Bastille](/The+Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 The Lost Bastille")) 
    * Requires 3 INT for him to trade with you
    * Trades boss souls for both spells and weapons, also sells some very useful spells without trading boss souls.

  1. Locate Straid in his cell in Lost Bastille (located above the stairs past the gate to Sinners' Rise).
  2. Unpetrify him using a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") after clearing out all the enemies surrounding him.
  3. Assuming that your Intelligence is at least a 3, you may now trade with him.
  4. If you trade at least 4 boss souls, talk to him and he will give you the Black Set (the staff he uses can only be obtained in Dragon Shrine at the cost of a [Pharros Lockstone](/Pharros+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros Lockstone"), an incredibly low price for any sorcerer with 50+ INT).

#### [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex") ([Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"))

  * Trades boss souls for weapons.
  * Blacksmith, but does not have the ability to imbue.

  1. Near the [Shaded Ruins bonfire](/Shaded+Ruins "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Ruins") there's a single petrified Lion Clan Warrior just across the tree bridge. Unpetrify and kill him to get the [Fang Key](/Fang+Key "Dark Souls 2 Fang Key").
  2. To the right of the [Giant Basilisk](/Great+Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Great Basilisk"), there are some wooden planks on the ground. If you walk on these planks, they will break and you will fall into a pit with 4 regular Basilisks that ambush you. These basilisks will petrify you quickly if not expected. Fight them or run further into the cave (if you do decide to run through the cave, avoid the puddles as they will corrode your equipment). Once the basilisks have been killed, you will find a locked wooden door. Use the Fang Key to unlock it and talk to Ornifex to trigger her relocation.
  3. Ornifex will leave and go to a room full of dolls near the [third bonfire](/Lower+Brightstone+Cove "Dark Souls 2 Lower Brightstone Cove") in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). She'll grant you a free trade (boss weapons only) of your choice (standard pricing is not shown when trading the first time).
