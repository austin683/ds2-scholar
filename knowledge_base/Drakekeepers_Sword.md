### How to get Drakekeeper's Sword in Dark Souls 2

  * Dropped by Drakekeepers wielding them at [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine").

### DS2 Drakekeeper's Sword Hints and Tips

  * Reinforced with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Has a complete suite of slashing attacks and consumes slightly more stamina than most straight swords, the same as the [Broadsword](/Broadsword "Dark Souls 2 Broadsword") and [Black Dragon Sword](/Black+Dragon+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Black Dragon Sword").
  * This weapon is quite similar to the [Broadsword](/Broadsword "Dark Souls 2 Broadsword"), even sharing a moveset. Notable differences include a small increase to attack power and poise damage, a lack of counter damage, and considerably greater reach. This makes the Drakekeeper's Sword a fairly versatile and effective weapon overall, if one can spare the equip load for it.
  * The incredible durability of the weapon can completely negate the need for the [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring") or [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder") in most circumstances.
