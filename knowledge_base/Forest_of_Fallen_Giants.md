### Full Forest of Fallen Giants Walkthrough

### Accessing From Majula

Starting at the [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") bonfire, facing the coast, you should notice a crumbled wall separating the hill and a big doorway, on the right; if not, look for the torch sconce marking the entrance. This leads down to an underground stone ramp-way. Continue into the darkness, making a U-turn on the first right of the main path in, you'll find an iron chest (chest is a [Mimic](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic") in NG+) with a [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin"). Turn around and proceed down the hallway, to find a dead end to the right and to the left a large gated door. Pulling the lever to the right of the gate, opens it.

The path opens up to a cave with a wooden bridge that spans a stream. Past the bridge, going to the right leads to the **Forest of Fallen Giants** , while to the left you'll find two long planks to a large stone with a chest that contains a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Beyond in the stream is a corpse with a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone") and [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead"), if you are confident in your jumping abilities, you can make the jump from the platform holding the chest. If not, simply head back up the wooden planks and drop down from the rocks above. To get to the **Forest** from here, simply continue forward, and follow the stream left.

### Welcome to the Forest

Upon your arrival, two [Hollow Infantries](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") wander immediately ahead with an additional two beyond, around the bend of the creek. In the creek, you'll find an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") roaming around, which won't aggro until you come within reach. Just ahead of the tree, up a short path on the right is a clearing in which you'll find **[The Crestfallen's Retreat bonfire](/The+Crestfallen%27s+Retreat "Dark Souls 2 The Crestfallen%27s Retreat"),** where you will be attacked by another **[Hollow](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry")**. Moving ahead across a plank bridge there is an Archer and three more Hollows. Dropping down to the stream below the plank bridge brings you to a corpse with [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead"). Across the planks and up the hill brings you to a ladder.

### Mossy Rotunda

Going up the ladder leads into an open area with a whopping twelve [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") playing dead, and a [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") throwing firebombs from the walkway above. There are several corpses on the ground holding various items including: a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"), [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"), 2x [Broken Straight Sword](/Broken+Straight+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Broken Straight Sword"), and a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem").

To the right is an opening to a cliff, and to the left a ladder up a moss covered tower. When you get on the ladder a [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") will start coming down the ladder ahead of you. Avoid damage by getting on the ladder and immediately getting off. Cross the planks at the top of the tower and go up to the right to a corpse with a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). Dropping down to the ledge below leads to the [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") who was throwing [Firebombs](/Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Firebomb"). Jumping across the gap to the ledge brings you to a corpse with [Shortsword](/Shortsword "Dark Souls 2 Shortsword") and a [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead"). Back at the base of the ladder that lead up, to the right you can spot a platform with items on it. Jumping over to it nets you [Throwing Knives](/Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Throwing Knife") and a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier").

### Hallways to Cardinal Tower Bonfire

To the left of the clearing is a mist, which leads through a wooded tunnel and into ruins. Before going straight into the broken wall, turn left and kill the ambushing [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") around the corner then return to the hole and drop into a room with 3 Hollows (one of them faking death). In the corner behind the shelves -you'll have to break it- find 20x [Wood Bolt](/Wood+Bolt "Dark Souls 2 Wood Bolt"). Leave the room through the door and head right to enter a room with two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier"); one will ambush you from the right after you pass the boxes, and the other will join after. Continuing down the hallway, you will find a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") x1 on the left, and stairs beyond with a hollow archer at the top who fires down at you. As you ascend another [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") from a ledge throws [Firebombs](/Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Firebomb") at you. A third [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") moves to ambush you as you reach the top of the stairs. By the back of the courtyard near the rubble you will find the [Buckler](/Buckler "Dark Souls 2 Buckler").

Along the wall to the left of the staircase is a ladder. At the top, straight ahead is a corpse with 5x [Witching Urn](/Witching+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Witching Urn") and a [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") (around the corner to the right). The large pair of closed doors lead to the **[Cardinal Tower bonfire](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower").** Next to it, you meet the [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia"). After exhausting her dialog, she will move to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). Before she leaves, be sure to snag a firebomb or two. You'll also want Lenigrast's Key in the nearish future, but most of the rest of her inventory can wait.

Going up the stairs in the room leads to a locked door. Once you obtain the [Soldier Key](/Soldier+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldier Key") (or break the door down), it opens to a room where you will find the following: a [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard"), a chest containing a [Small Leather Shield](/Small+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Small Leather Shield") and [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder"), a [Hand Axe](/Hand+Axe "Dark Souls 2 Hand Axe") and [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"), a [Hollow Soldier Helm](/Hollow+Soldier+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Soldier Helm"), and a door that leads to another room with an iron chest holding [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem") x2 and a [Small White Sign Soapstone](/Small+White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 Small White Sign Soapstone"). A [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") will stand up behind you once you go through the door. You can drop down here and onto the branch to obtain a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing"), then to the bottom to return to the bonfire. 

### Scaffolding and Flame Lizard Cave

Outside of the bonfire room you can drop down to wooden planks where there will be two [Hollow Infantry Soldiers](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry"). Proceeding down the plank, there is a hole in the wall on the left which leads you back to the staircase and bonfire from the previous section. Jumping to the plank ledge brings you to a corpse with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Drop down to the wooden platform and kill the [Hollow](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry"). Go down the ramp and walk carefully down the tree trunk, where you come across a corpse with a [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead") and [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch").

On the ground, expect several Hollows and two [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"). To the left, a cave opens to a tunnel lined with petrified people. Flames tinge the air while explosions can be heard. A corpse on the floor carries a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight"). Deeper into the tunnel, a grated door is on the left where there is a chest with a [Fire Longsword](/Fire+Longsword "Dark Souls 2 Fire Longsword"). Quickly make a dash for the door and get it open to secure yourself a safe sport from the explosive molten balls that will begin pelting you.

Progressing down the tunnel means confronting the fire-breathing [Flame Lizard](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") responsible for the fires. You can kill it if you really want, but it's neither easy (this early in the game) nor especially rewarding. Behind the lizard are three more, a locked door, many corpses to loot, and a chest. (There is another way to reach the treasures, detailed in [Flame Lizard Pit](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#FlameLizardPit "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#FlameLizardPit")).

To the left of the cave with the fire there is another cave with a [Foot Soldier Shield](/Foot+Soldier+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Foot Soldier Shield"), guarded by an [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"). Going back out the tunnel and into the clearing, kill another [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") and there is a ladder near the corpse that had the human effigy. To the left of the ladder is a corpse with a 3x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Taking the ladder up brings you back to the plank near the hole in the wall mentioned earlier in this section.

#### Cardinal Tower Bonfire Ladder

In the bonfire room is a ladder down into a large room with columns. There are two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") here waiting to attack, one sits feigning death on the left, and one comes from the bridge. Down at the bottom of the room, giant [Flame Lizards](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") (See 'Flame Lizard Pit' below) are visible. Facing the bottom of the ladder, to your right is a closed door that does not open from this side (later on, this will become a shortcut).

Going across the bridge leads to a feigning [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier"), and a locked door on the right. A body at the corner holds a [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead"). Back across the bridge, jog right through an open archway which leads to a room with a locked door on the right (leads to [Soldier's Rest](/Soldier's+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Soldier's Rest") area) and mist straight ahead. Another [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") is laying on the ground behind the large pillar on the right.

### Rooftops, Cale, and First Shortcut

Going through the mist leads to an area with rooftops, scaffolding, and a large tree branch directly ahead which leads up. As soon as you enter the area, two [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") will converge on you from the right, and an archer on a wall far to the right will start shooting -- he will continue to pick at you through this entire section. Running up the tree-root brings you to the top of a wall where an [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") stand near wooden breastworks. Get him out of the way. 

Back near the top of the tree-root, you can drop down to a peaked rooftop (the drop will take some health). When you drop down, you'll want to keep moving, but note that just behind you here is another drop to a round room with a [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") and a corpse with a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"), return for it later. There are two [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") on the rooftops, plus another Archer to your left. Keep moving, work quickly, and take care not to fall. Once you've killed all the [Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry"), head back to where you dropped down from the root. Dash and jump across a small gap to deal with the pesky archer. Then, drop down to another landing with a ladder in front of you, and a cave to your left. 

Enter the cave slowly and carefully; as you move forward you'll eventually trigger a boulder trap. After the boulder passes, there's a corpse straight ahead with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") on it. Do  **not** go right down around the corner; you'll fall into a hole. Continue up the ramp where the boulder came down, dispatch another Hollow Archer to the Left, and find a corpse with an [Amber Herb](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb"), you'll also find [Cale the Cartographer](/Cale+the+Cartographer "Dark Souls 2 Cale the Cartographer") crawling around back in the cave. Exhaust his dialog, and he will give you the key to the mansion in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula").

Retrace your steps back to the ladder on the same level as the entrance to the boulder-trapped cave. Climb the ladder and run down the battlements to your right, finally dealing with the annoying **Archer**. Continue down the battlements and drop to your right onto the rooftop, then head back right again up the ramp and towards the "first" rooftop. Drop down to the middle tier of the house, and follow a ramp down the ground; another **Archer** to your right may start sniping you. Head straight along the water to a corpse next to a gate with a [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard").

To get back to the main tree-root from the ground at the gate:

  * From the gate, head straight back along the water and right to the plank ramp you (probably) came down
  * About four strides up, turn a hard left onto a short set of planks which drop you back to the ground below the big tree root
  * Go under the tree root, following the water around to your left to a ladder. There may be a Hollow Infantry hiding here.
  * Climb the ladder to the roof and turn right to a plank bridge which takes you back to the tree root.

Go back up to the top of the tree root where you killed the [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"). Nearby, a ladder on the right brings you up to a rooftop platform and triggers an appearance of an eagle who drops the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") mini-boss. Probably a good idea to run away here, level-up and face him [later](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#PursuerBossFight "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#PursuerBossFight"). If you really want to take the fight, at least open the nearby shortcut first, lest you die. Defeating him here will skip his [ later boss fight](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#PursuerBossFight "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#PursuerBossFight"), but if you drop off the platform or die, he will disappear from this current location for good.

In the far corner of the platform where the eagle drops the Pursuer is a fire-bombing [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") and there is a [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") in each corner. There are some bodies in that place, they hold a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"), [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") x2, a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"), an [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard") and a [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder"). Back down the short ladder, at the end of the way, past all of the breastworks are a bunch of explosive barrels stacked by the wall. Throw a firebomb (from a distance; purchasable from [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia"))/bait the firebomb-throwing [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") to set off a huge explosion which opens a shortcut back to the [Cardinal Tower bonfire](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower").

### Ballista Room, Pharros' Lock, and Pate

Coming out of the new shortcut bomb-hole, two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") await to your left, and straight past is a ladder which leads down to a short stone staircase. In the corner on the left by the stairs is a corpse with [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"). Moving forward, to the right is a destroyed wall which opens to a room with ballistae that fire arrows when triggered by proximity to the room. Inside the room you are swarmed by 4 [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") so it is best to trigger the trap and walk out, letting the arrows kill one of the enemies. If this doesn't work, run in and go to the left before they fire and take them out before they swarm you.

The ballistae can be operated by the player which should lead to some fun PvP moments. There are two corpses on the ground with [Great Soul Arrow](/Great+Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Great Soul Arrow"), a [Large Soul of a Lost Undead](/Large+Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Lost Undead"), and [Blue Wooden Shield](/Blue+Wooden+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Blue Wooden Shield"). Inside this room in the back, there's a ladder. Opening the chest in the lower room triggers a trap (either poison or arrows it is best to roll to the left or right and slightly behind the chest as this will avoid arrows and most of the poison), inside the chest is a [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard"). If you have a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros'+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone") and insert it into the mouth in the wall (if not you can buy it from [merchant hag Melentia](/merchant+hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 merchant hag Melentia")). A nearby wall will shine, indicating you should attack it. Upon attack, it will reveal a hidden room with two chests containing the [Chloranthy Ring](/Chloranthy+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Chloranthy Ring") and a [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab"). Attacking the closed door down here will cause three enemies inside to open the door, inside you can find a chest containing the [Life Ring ](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") and a [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard").

Beyond the ballista room along the same wall, you encounter the NPC [Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate") who warns you about a trap. Walking through the adjacent archway leads to four Hollow Infantry who swarm you. The gate in the archway is lowered behind you, preventing you from returning back through. Several Hollow Infantry and soldiers attack here. Walking straight on through the open doorway brings you into a hallway, in the corner of which is a corpse with [Aromatic Ooze](/Aromatic+Ooze "Dark Souls 2 Aromatic Ooze") x3. On the Wall past this item there is a hidden wall that contains a [Sorcerer's Staff](/Sorcerer%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sorcerer%27s Staff") and [Amber Herbs](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb") x1 . Continue down the hallway and left to the bottom of a staircase.

Once up the stairs, go past the cart which blocks the path, going left takes you to the top of the wall above Pate and the gate that dropped behind you after crossing into the courtyard. You can drop down either side from here. Returning to Pate continues his dialogue tree and earns you [White Sign Soapstone](/White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 White Sign Soapstone").

### Hollow Royal Soldiers and Firebombs

Going directly opposite of the ballista room brings you to a courtyard full of exploding barrels, with a doorway ahead and an open archway to the right. There are hollows above with firebombs, so be especially wary of the barrels when passing through here. Going through the right archway brings you to another courtyard with a [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") slumped along the wall to the left; he reanimates and attacks. Continuing through another archway into yet another courtyard, you'll find a large tree is on the right and two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") attacking the tree. Behind that tree is a corpse with a [Large Soul of a Lost Undead](/Large+Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Lost Undead").

Returning back through the doorway, there is a ladder up the wall to your left. Going up the ladder brings you to the top of the wall above Pate and near trigger-gate. Going to the right leads to a corpse with a [Light Crossbow](/Light+Crossbow "Dark Souls 2 Light Crossbow"). Through the doorway past the corpse and into the fort leads inside another section of the fort. Inside drop down to the room and defeat the three [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier"). Open the iron chest to obtain a [Mail Breaker](/Mail+Breaker "Dark Souls 2 Mail Breaker") and [Infantry Helm](/Infantry+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Infantry Helm"). If you go back to the ledge above the three hollows, you can jump across to loot a corpse with a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch") and a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier").

### Seaside Sword Room and Second Shortcut

You can drop down from here to return to the portion of the courtyard where the two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") are located. If you haven't already, kill the [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") and go through the doorway into a large room. To the right and up the stairs is a corpse with a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") and [Homeward Bone ](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"). Back down the stairs and to the right is a locked door (opened with the [Soldiers Key](/Soldiers+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldiers Key")). To the left, as you enter, and straight down the room are two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier"). Just past the ruins of the giant sword a [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") waits to ambush you from behind a cart. In the corner nearby is a corpse with 2x [Amber Herb](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb"). Going up the blade of the stone sword jutting out of the building will trigger a trap: four [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") drop down behind you onto the sword. At the end of the sword you will find a [Halberd](/Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Halberd") and [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier").   
  
Once back down the sword, head through the mist and into a large open room with a sconce. to the right is a broken wall which leads into a room with a seated [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier"). The staircase in the room leads down to a boarded up door. A corpse at the base has a [Large Leather Shield](/Large+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Large Leather Shield") and [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Returning back into the first room you first entered, head straight across and turn right. On the right is a corpse with 10x [Fire Arrow](/Fire+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Fire Arrow"). Just beyond and to the right is the elevator to the [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant") boss. But, first, open the door just ahead which creates a shortcut to the ladder from the [Cardinal Tower](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower") bonfire.   
  
When you're ready to try [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant"), step on the pressure plate elevator and descend. (If you step on the pressure plate but immediately hop off of the elevator, the other side will bring up a [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"). Descending either elevator goes to the same location.) Go down the hallway where a [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") waits in the doorway on the left. The door is locked for the time being. To open it, you need the [Iron Key](/Iron+Key "Dark Souls 2 Iron Key") from the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"). This door leads to the [Flame Lizard Pit](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#FlameLizardPit "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#FlameLizardPit") mentioned earlier. Straight into the tunnel and enter the mist to confront [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant"). If you are not hollow, there will be 1-2 [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") summon signs outside the boss fog.

BOSS FIGHT: [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant")

After obtaining the [Soldier Key](/Soldier+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldier Key"), the next stop on the recommended route is [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame"). Alternatively, you can also open some areas here in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") with the key, including a way to the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") boss and to an early visit to [Steady Hand McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff") after the Pursuer boss fight. [McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff") will infuse your weapons, unlike [Lenigrast](/Blacksmith+Lenigrast "Dark Souls 2 Blacksmith Lenigrast").

###   
Ironclad Enclave - Soldier's Rest

After obtaining the [Soldier Key](/Soldier+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldier Key"), return to the room before the [rooftops section](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#RooftopsCale "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#RooftopsCale"), just past the bottom of the [Cardinal Tower](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower") bonfire ladder, and to the left of the bridge above the [Flame Lizard Pit](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#FlameLizardPit "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#FlameLizardPit"). When entering this room, instead of going straight, where the fog was, turn to the right towards a door, which can now be opened with the [Soldier Key](/Soldier+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldier Key"). Descending the staircase beyond leads to a fairly dark, long rectangular room. A shade summon sign for [Ruined Alfis](/Ruined+Alfis "Dark Souls 2 Ruined Alfis") will be just next to the doorway. Sconces are scattered about the room and, when lit, illuminate the entire area nicely. 6 [Skeletons](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") will appear as you move forward. A corpse in the corner near the first Skeleton has a [Black Firebomb](/Black+Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Black Firebomb") x3 and a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"), the corpse near the end of the dark room has a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). A door exits to an outside area where the remnants of several buildings are found. [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier")s are the main enemy here, but a hollow archer will immediately become a nuisance. Hollows are present in a small building directly across from where you come into this section. Ladders outside and inside this building lead to the roof where the player will be greeted by the large hammers of three [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"). On this rooftop is a corpse holding a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier"), a [Whip](/Whip "Dark Souls 2 Whip"), a [Bastard Sword](/Bastard+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Bastard Sword"), a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") and 3x [Cracked Red Eye Orb ](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb").

Heading back down you'll find a small clearing and a corpse by a gate (the other side is the area in which the ambush Pate warns about is found). The corpse holds an [Amber Herb](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb") and [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"). A broken down building creates a path over a chasm leading to the rest of the area. To the right are some steps leading up to a wooden chest containing the [Hunters set](/Hunter+Set "Dark Souls 2 Hunter Set") and a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight"). Once in this area the NPC invader [Armorer Dennis](/Armorer+Dennis "Dark Souls 2 Armorer Dennis") will appear. At the bottom of the stairs to the right will be two openings in the building. The first on will lead to the **[Soldier's Rest bonfire](/Soldier%27s+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Soldier%27s Rest")** and the second opening will lead to a room containing a Giant Tree which may be holding a [Seed of a Tree of Giants](/Seed+of+a+Tree+of+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Seed of a Tree of Giants").

### To the Pursuer

A second door can be open from down the Cardinal Tower bonfire ladder. Go through the bridge and get rid of the three hollow on the way. To the right of the bridge is a door you can now open. Walking in front of you, you will find a chest with 3x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch") and a [Ring of Restoration](/Ring+of+restoration "Dark Souls 2 Ring of restoration"). Back on, you can go to a courtyard through the right, and pick up a [Grand Lance](/Grand+Lance "Dark Souls 2 Grand Lance"). Be careful of the [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier"), as he can be tough at this stage of the game, though he also will not attack if you stay away from his door (you can't open it anyways). There is also a chest containing some [Amber Herbs](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb") here. Now go back to the room, where you walked up a giant stone sword. On the right end of the room, there is a staircase and a door which previously couldn't be opened, it is now possible with the [Soldier Key](/Soldier+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldier Key"). Beat the two [Royal Swordsmen](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman") up the stairs. At the top, you will be in an area with a mist wall and a third [Royal Swordsman](/Royal+Swordsman#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=royal+soldier&gsc.sort= "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=royal soldier&gsc.sort=") together with a bow-wielding [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier"). Be careful, as this Swordsman might jump-attack you while you go up the stairs. Before getting through the mist wall, climb the stairs on the right to find a body and a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/soul+of+a+nameless+soldier "Dark Souls 2 soul of a nameless soldier"), and 3x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Now, get ready to fight the area's boss and traverse the mist! NOTE: when you are not hollow, you can go back to the dark room with the skeletons to summon [Ruined Alfis](/Ruined+Alfis "Dark Souls 2 Ruined Alfis") to help you in the fight.

BOSS FIGHT: [The Pursuer](/The+Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 The Pursuer")

After defeating the Pursuer, continue forward through the gap in the stone head. Through the hole in the floor immediately ahead, if you drop down, you will find the [Drangleic Set](/Drangleic+Set "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Set"), [Drangleic Shield](/Drangleic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Shield"), and [Drangleic Sword](/Drangleic+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Sword"). Continue one more drop and you will be near the beginning of your ascent towards the Pursuer. If you head all the way back up to the room past the boss, past the gap in the floor you see two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") attacking another Giant Tree. When you go up the stairs to the right you will see a nest which you can "examine." Doing so will prompt an eagle to take you to [The Tower Apart](/The+Tower+Apart "Dark Souls 2 The Tower Apart") bonfire in the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille").

### Flame Lizard Pit

_**Note** : this area is relatively high-level compared to the rest of Forest of Fallen Giants; probably one to come back to later._   
If you decide to jump in the Flame Lizard Pit, use the Silver Cat Ring and try to drop down onto the junk at the end of the left side. The [Flame Lizards](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") are quite durable and cause a lot of damage with attacks (4 poison arrows to start the process, will eat about 3/4 of their hp). A high fire defense is recommended, however they have a lunge attack which is unblockable and will knock you down. This is in addition to breathing fire.

There are a total of four [Flame Lizards](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") below, one of which is readily visible and can be taken out with a bow and patience. If you switch the elevator to the Last Giant fight so the side closer to the pit is up, it can be used as a sniper spot for a second [Flame Lizard](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") who can only be seen from certain angles (that's one of them). An archer [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") will raise with this side of the elevator so watch out. After the second [Flame Lizard](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") is killed, a small tunnel leads down that he was blocking. Another one is to the right in a large chamber and the last is to the left in a smaller (but still big) side chamber. A locked door (opened using Iron Key) leads to the Last Giant fight (tunnel right before it).

The two [Flame Lizards](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") in the pit can be taken out with a bow by drawing them up partially and taking a few shots. They will retreat at some point and this will need to be repeated. Avoid the flames near the [Flame Lizards](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard"), as they can burn your character, but only if you get very close(The flames will disappear, when you kill the 4 lizards, leaving holes, which are instant death if you jump into them. The flames will be there again, after reloading the level.). In the first section you can find a corpse with a [Firedrake Stone](/Firedrake+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Firedrake Stone"), a skull holding a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight"), a skeleton with the [Hawk Ring](/Hawk+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Hawk Ring") and a chest carrying a [Flame Quartz Ring](/Flame+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flame Quartz Ring") +1. In the lower area, a corpse holds [Cracked Red Eye Orb](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb") x2. In the area with the last [Flame Lizard](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") (who tend to drop Cracked Red Eye Orbs as well) there is a skeleton carrying the [Rebel's Greatshield](/Rebel%27s+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Rebel%27s Greatshield") and the [Heavy Iron Key](/Heavy+Iron+Key "Dark Souls 2 Heavy Iron Key").

### Notes

### Full Forest of Fallen Giants Walkthrough

### Accessing From Majula

Starting at the [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") bonfire, facing the coast, you should notice a crumbled wall separating the hill and a big doorway, on the right; if not, look for the torch sconce marking the entrance. This leads down to an underground stone ramp-way. Continue into the darkness, making a U-turn on the first right of the main path in, you'll find an iron chest (chest is a [Mimic](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic") in NG+) with a [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin"). Turn around and proceed down the hallway, to find a dead end to the right and to the left a large gated door. Pulling the lever to the right of the gate, opens it.

The path opens up to a cave with a wooden bridge that spans a stream. Past the bridge, going to the right leads to the **Forest of Fallen Giants** , while to the left you'll find two long planks to a large stone with a chest that contains a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Beyond in the stream is a corpse with a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone") and [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead"), if you are confident in your jumping abilities, you can make the jump from the platform holding the chest. If not, simply head back up the wooden planks and drop down from the rocks above. To get to the **Forest** from here, simply continue forward, and follow the stream left.

### One with Nature

Upon your arrival, two [Hollow Infantries](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") wander immediately ahead with an additional two beyond, around the bend of the creek. To the right, across the stream at the base of a tree is a with a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Following the stream, and hugging the right wall, you'll come up a short path into a clearing in which you'll find **[The Crestfallen's Retreat bonfire](/The+Crestfallen%27s+Retreat "Dark Souls 2 The Crestfallen%27s Retreat")**. Move ahead across a plank bridge there is an Archer and 2 more Hollows. Dropping down to the stream below the plank bridge brings you to a corpse with [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead"). Across the planks and up the hill brings you to a ladder.

### Mossy Rotunda

Going up the ladder leads into an open area with several Hollows and an Archer above. If you can't handle all Hollows at once, try luring them to the top of the ladder, then re-descending it quickly. The Hollows will follow you down the ladder and you can dispatch them one by one.

At the base of a tree in the Mossy Rotunda, you'll find a resting [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight"), who will not attack unless provoked. While that sounds well and good, killing him drops the [Heide Knight Sword](/Heide+Knight+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight Sword"). There are two corpses on the ground where there is a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") and a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Next to the [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight"), a corpse holds a [Broken Straight Sword](/Broken+Straight+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Broken Straight Sword").

To the right is an opening to a cliff, and to the left a ladder up a moss covered tower. There are two Hollows on the stairs up. Cross the the planks at the top of the tower and go up to the right to a corpse with a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier"). Dropping down to the ledge below leads to the Archer and a Hollow. Jumping across the gap to the ledge brings you to a corpse with [Shortsword](/Shortsword "Dark Souls 2 Shortsword") and [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead"). Back at the base of the ladder that lead up, to the right you can spot a platform with items on it. Jumping over to it nets you [Throwing Knives](/Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Throwing Knife").

### Hallways to Cardinal Tower Bonfire

To the left of the clearing is a mist, which leads through a wooded tunnel and into ruins. Before going straight into the broken wall, turn left and kill the ambushing [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") around the corner then return to the hole and drop into a room with 3 Hollows (one of them faking death). In the corner behind the shelves -you'll have to break it- find 20x [Wood Bolt](/Wood+Bolt "Dark Souls 2 Wood Bolt"). Leave the room through the door and head right to enter a room with two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier"); one will ambush you from the right after you pass the boxes, and the other will join after. Continuing down the hallway, you will find a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") x1 on the left, and stairs beyond with a hollow archer at the top who fires down at you. As you ascend another [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") from a ledge throws [Firebombs](/Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Firebomb") at you. A third [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") moves to ambush you as you reach the top of the stairs. By the back of the courtyard near the rubble you will find the [Buckler](/Buckler "Dark Souls 2 Buckler").

Along the wall to the left of the staircase is a ladder. At the top, straight ahead is a corpse with 5x [Witching Urn](/Witching+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Witching Urn") and a [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") (around the corner to the right). Back behind you is a set of doors which open to a room with the **[Cardinal Tower bonfire](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower").** Next to it, you meet the [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia"). After speaking with her and getting some back-story, she will move to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). Grab a Firebomb or 2 for later.

Going up the stairs in the room leads to a locked door. Once you obtain the [Soldier Key](/Soldier+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldier Key") (or break the door down), it opens to a room where you will find the following: a [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard"), a chest containing a [Small Leather Shield](/Small+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Small Leather Shield") and [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder"), a [Hand Axe](/Hand+Axe "Dark Souls 2 Hand Axe") and [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"), a [Hollow Soldier Helm](/Hollow+Soldier+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Soldier Helm"), and a door that leads to another room with an iron chest holding [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem") x2 and a [Small White Sign Soapstone](/Small+White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 Small White Sign Soapstone"). A [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") will stand up behind you once you go through the door. You can drop down here and onto the branch to obtain a [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing"), then to the bottom to return to the bonfire. 

### Scaffolding and Flame Lizard Cave

Outside of the bonfire room you can drop down to wooden planks where there will be two [Hollow Infantry Soldiers](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry"). Proceeding down the plank, there is a hole in the wall on the left which leads you back to the staircase and bonfire from the previous section. Jumping to the plank ledge brings you to a corpse with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Drop down to the wooden platform and kill the [Hollow](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry"). Go down the ramp and walk carefully down the tree trunk, where you come across a corpse with a [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead") and [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch").

On the ground, expect several Hollows and two [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"). To the left, a cave opens to a tunnel lined with petrified people. Flames tinge the air while explosions can be heard. A corpse on the floor carries a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight"). Deeper into the tunnel, a grated door is on the left where there is a chest with a [Fire Longsword](/Fire+Longsword "Dark Souls 2 Fire Longsword"). Quickly make a dash for the door and get it open to secure yourself a safe sport from the explosive molten balls that will begin pelting you.

Progressing down the tunnel means confronting the fire-breathing [Flame Lizard](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") responsible for the fires. You can also kill it which takes time and maybe isn't worth it. However, by killing it you can leap inside the hole (It could be a bug/glitch, because it will take some tries to be able to jump into it, which can happen by trying to jump from the left side of the hole). Inside the hole there are three more [Flame Lizards](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard"), a closed door, many corpses to loot, and a chest. (There is another way to reach the treasures, detailed in [Flame Lizard Pit](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#FlameLizardPit "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#FlameLizardPit")).

To the left of the cave with the fire there is another cave with an [Foot Soldier Shield](/Foot+Soldier+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Foot Soldier Shield"), guarded by an [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"). Going back out the tunnel and into the clearing, kill another [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") and there is a ladder near the corpse that had the human effigy. To the left of the ladder is a corpse with a 3x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Taking the ladder up brings you back to the plank near the hole in the wall mentioned earlier in this section.

#### Cardinal Tower Bonfire Ladder

In the bonfire room is a ladder down into a large room with columns. There are two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") here waiting to attack, one sits feigning death on the left, and one comes from the bridge. Down at the bottom of the room, giant [Flame Lizards](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") (See 'Flame Lizard Pit' below) are visible. Facing the bottom of the ladder, to your right is a closed door that does not open from that side (later on, this will be opened from the other side creating a shortcut).

Going across the bridge leads to a feigning [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier"), and another locked door on the right. A body at the corner holds a [Soul of a Lost Undead](/Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Lost Undead"). Back across the bridge, jog right through an open archway which leads to a room with a locked door on the right (leads to [Soldier's Rest](/Soldier's+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Soldier's Rest") area) and mist straight ahead. Another [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") is laying on the ground behind the large pillar on the right.

### Rooftops, Cale, and First Shortcut

Going through the mist leads to an area with rooftops, scaffolding, and a large tree branch directly ahead which leads up. As soon as you enter the area, two [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") will converge on you from the right, and an archer on a wall far to the right will start shooting -- he will continue to pick at you through this entire section. Running up the tree-root brings you to the top of a wall where an [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") stand near wooden breastworks. Get him out of the way.

Back near the top of the tree-root, you can drop down to a peaked rooftop (the drop will take some health). When you drop down, you'll want to keep moving, but note that just behind you here is another drop to a round room with a [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") and a corpse with a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"), return for it later. There are two [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") on the rooftops, plus another Archer to your left. Keep moving, work quickly, and take care not to fall. Once you've killed all the [Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry"), head back to where you dropped down from the root. Dash and jump across a small gap to deal with the pesky archer. Then, drop down to another landing with a ladder in front of you, and a cave to your left.

Enter the cave slowly and carefully; as you move forward you'll eventually trigger a boulder trap. After the boulder passes, there's a corpse straight ahead with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") on it. Do  **not** go right down around the corner and fall in the hole and die. Continue up the ramp where the boulder came down, dispatch another Hollow Archer to the Left, and find a corpse with an [Amber Herb](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb"), you'll also find [Cale the Cartographer](/Cale+the+Cartographer "Dark Souls 2 Cale the Cartographer") crawling around back in the cave. Exhaust his dialog, and he will give you the key to the mansion in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula").

Retrace your steps back to the ladder on the same level as the entrance to the boulder-trapped cave. Climb the ladder and run down the battlements to your right, finally dealing with the annoying **Archer**. Continue down the battlements and drop to your right onto the rooftop, then head back right again up the ramp and towards the "first" rooftop. Drop down to the middle tier of the house, and follow a ramp down the ground; another **Archer** to your right may start sniping you. Head straight along the water to a corpse next to a gate with a [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard").

To get back to the main tree-root from the ground at the gate:

  * From the gate, head straight back along the water and right to the plank ramp you (probably) came down
  * About four strides up, turn a hard left onto a short set of planks which drop you back to the ground below the big tree root
  * Go under the tree root, following the water around to your left to a ladder. There may be a Hollow Infantry hiding here.
  * Climb the ladder to the roof and turn right to a plank bridge which takes you back to the tree root.

Go back up to the top of the tree root where you killed the [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"). Nearby, a ladder on the right brings you up to a rooftop platform and triggers an in-appearance of an eagle who drops the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") mini-boss. Probably a good idea to run away here, level-up and face him [later](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#PursuerBossFight "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#PursuerBossFight"). If you defeat him here, he will not appear for [the later boss fight](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#PursuerBossFight "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#PursuerBossFight"), but if you drop off the platform or die, he will disappear from this current location for good.

In the far corner of the platform where the eagle drops the Pursuer is a fire-bombing [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") and there is a [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") in each corner. There are some bodies in that place, they hold a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"), [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") x2, a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"), an [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard") and a [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder"). Back down the short ladder, at the end of the way, past all of the breastworks are a bunch of explosive barrels stacked by the wall. Throw a firebomb (from a distance; purchasable from [Merchant Hag Malentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia"))/bait the firebomb-throwing [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") to set off a huge explosion which opens a shortcut back to the [Cardinal Tower bonfire](/Cardinal+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Cardinal Tower").

### Ballista Room, Pharros' Lock, and Pate

Coming out of the new shortcut bomb-hole, two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") await to your left, and straight past is a ladder which leads down to a short stone staircase. In the corner on the left by the stairs is a corpse with [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"). Moving forward, to the right is a knocked in wall which opens to a room with ballistas that fire arrows when triggered by proximity to the room. Inside the room you are swarmed by several [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") so it is best to trigger the trap and walk out, letting the arrows kill one of the enemies. If this doesn't work, run in and go to the left before they fire and take them out before they swarm you.

The ballistas can be operated by the player which should lead to some fun PvP moments. There are two corpses on the ground with [Great Soul Arrow](/Great+Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Great Soul Arrow"), a [Large Soul of a Lost Undead](/Large+Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Lost Undead"), and [Blue Wooden Shield](/Blue+Wooden+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Blue Wooden Shield"). Inside this room in the back, there's a ladder. Opening the chest in the lower room triggers a trap (either poison or arrows it is best to roll to the left or right and slightly behind the chest as this will avoid arrows and most of the poison), inside the chest is a [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard"). If you have a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros'+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Lockstone") and insert it into the mouth in the wall (if not you can buy it from [merchant hag Melentia](/merchant+hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 merchant hag Melentia")). A nearby wall will shine, indicating you should attack it. Upon attack, it will reveal a hidden room with two chests containing the [Chloranthy Ring](/Chloranthy+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Chloranthy Ring") and a [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab"). Attacking the Closed door down here will cause three enemies inside to open the door, inside you can find a chest containing the [Life Ring ](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring") and a [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard").

Beyond that room along the same wall, you encounter the NPC [Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate") who warns you about a trap. Walking through the adjacent archway leads to four Hollow Infantry who swarm you. The gate in the archway is lowered behind you, preventing you from returning back through. Several Hollow Infantry and soldiers attack here. Walking straight on through the open doorway brings you into a hallway, in the corner of which is a corpse with [Aromatic Ooze](/Aromatic+Ooze "Dark Souls 2 Aromatic Ooze") x3. On the Wall past this item there is a hidden wall that contains a [Sorcerer's Staff](/Sorcerer%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Sorcerer%27s Staff") and [Amber Herbs](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb") x1 . Continue down the hallway and left to the bottom of a staircase.

Once up the stairs, go past the cart which blocks the path, going left takes you to the top of the wall above Pate and the gate that dropped behind you after crossing into the courtyard. You can drop down either side from here. Returning to Pate continues his dialogue tree and earns you [White Sign Soapstone](/White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 White Sign Soapstone").

### Hollow Royal Soldiers and Firebombs

Going directly opposite of the ballista room brings you to a courtyard (and exploding barrels) with doorway ahead and an open archway to the right. Going through the right one brings you to another courtyard with a [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") slumped along the wall to the left; he reanimates and attacks. Continuing through another archway into yet another courtyard, you'll find a large tree is on the right and two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") attacking the tree. Behind that tree is a corpse with a [Large Soul of a Lost Undead](/Large+Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Lost Undead").

Returning back through the doorway, there is a ladder up the wall to your left. Going up the ladder brings you to the top of the wall above Pate and near trigger-gate. Going to the right leads to a corpse with a [Light Crossbow](/Light+Crossbow "Dark Souls 2 Light Crossbow"). Through the doorway past the corpse and into the fort leads inside another section of the fort. Inside drop down to the room and defeat the three [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier"). Open the iron chest to obtain a [Mail Breaker](/Mail+Breaker "Dark Souls 2 Mail Breaker") and [Infantry Helm](/Infantry+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Infantry Helm"). If you go back to the ledge above the three hollows, you can jump across to loot a corpse with a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch") and a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier").

### Seaside Sword Room and Second Shortcut

You can drop down from here to return to the portion of the courtyard where the two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") are located. If you haven't already, kill the [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") and go through the doorway into a large room. To the right and up the stairs is a corpse with a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") and [Homeward Bone ](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"). Back down the stairs and to the right is a locked door (opened with the [Soldiers Key](/Soldiers+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldiers Key")). To the left, as you enter, and straight down the room are two [Hollow Royal Soldiers](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier"). Just past the ruins of the giant sword a [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") waits to ambush you from behind a cart. In the corner nearby is a corpse with 2x [Amber Herb](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb"). Going up the blade of the stone sword, trigger a trap where four [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") drop down behind you onto the sword. At the end of the sword you will find a [Halberd](/Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Halberd") and [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier").   
  
Once back down the sword, head through the mist and into a large open room with a sconce. to the right is a broken wall which leads into a room with a seated [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier"). The staircase in the room leads down to a boarded up door. A corpse at the base has a [Large Leather Shield](/Large+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Large Leather Shield") and [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Returning back into the first room you first entered, head straight across and turn right. On the right is a corpse with 10x [Fire Arrow](/Fire+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Fire Arrow"). Just beyond and to the right is the elevator to the [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant") boss. But, first, open the door just ahead which creates a shortcut to the ladder from the Second Bonfire.   
  
When you're ready to try [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant"), step on the pressure plate elevator and descend. (If you step on the pressure plate but immediately hop off of the elevator, the other side will bring up a [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"). Descending either elevator goes to the same location) Go down the hallway where a [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") waits in the doorway on the left. The door is locked for the time being. To open it, you need the [Iron Key](/Iron+Key "Dark Souls 2 Iron Key") from the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep"). This door leads to the [Flame Lizard Pit](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#FlameLizardPit "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#FlameLizardPit") mentioned earlier. Straight into the tunnel and enter the mist to confront [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant"). It is recommended summon the NPC [Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate") here.

BOSS FIGHT: [The Last Giant](/The+Last+Giant "Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant")

### Ironclad Enclave - Soldier's Rest

After obtaining the [Soldier Key](/Soldier+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldier Key"), return to the room before the [rooftops section](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#RooftopsCale "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#RooftopsCale"), just past the bottom of the bonfire ladder, and to the left of the bridge above the [Flame Lizard Pit](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants#FlameLizardPit "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants#FlameLizardPit"). The Soldier Key unlocks the door in this room and opens to the top of a staircase. Descending leads to a fairly dark, long rectangular room. A shade summon sign for Ruined Alfis will be just next to the doorway. Sconces are scattered about the room and, when lit, illuminate the entire area nicely. Several skeletons will appear as you move forward. A corpse in the corner by the sleeping hollow has a [Black Firebomb](/Black+Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Black Firebomb") x3 and a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"). A door exits to an outside area where the remnants of several buildings are found. [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") are the main enemy here, but a hollow archer will immediately become a nuisance. Hollows are present in a small building directly across from where you come into this section. Ladders outside and inside this building lead to the roof where the player will be greeted by large hammers from three [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"). On this rooftop is a corpse holding a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier"), a [Whip](/Whip "Dark Souls 2 Whip") and 3x [Cracked Red Eye Orb ](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb").

Heading back down you'll find a small clearing and a corpse by a gate (the other side is the area in which the ambush Pate warns about is found). The corpse holds an [Amber Herb](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb") and [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom"). A broken down building creates a path over a chasm leading to the rest of the area. To the right are some steps leading up to a wooden chest containing the [Hunters set](/Hunter+Set "Dark Souls 2 Hunter Set") and a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight"). Once in this area the NPC invader [Armorer Dennis](/Armorer+Dennis "Dark Souls 2 Armorer Dennis") will appear. At the bottom of the stairs to the right will be two openings in the building. The first on will lead to the **[Soldier's Rest bonfire](/Soldier%27s+Rest "Dark Souls 2 Soldier%27s Rest")** and the second opening will lead to a room containing a Giant Tree which may be holding a [Seed of a Tree of Giants](/Seed+of+a+Tree+of+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Seed of a Tree of Giants").

### To the Pursuer

A second door can be open from down the ladder. Go through the bridge and get rid of the three hollow on the way. To the right of the bridge is a door you can now open. Walking in front of you, you will find a chest with 3x [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch") and a [Ring of Restoration](/Ring+of+restoration "Dark Souls 2 Ring of restoration"). Back on, you can go to a courtyard through the right, and pick up a [Grand Lance](/Grand+Lance "Dark Souls 2 Grand Lance"), be careful of the [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier"), as he can be tough with you being this low leveled. There is also a chest containing some [Amber Herbs](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb") here. Now go back to the Seaside Sword room. The door left of the stairs can now be opened. Beat the two hollows up the stairs and be careful with the one above, he may jump attack from the stairs. Go up and you will face a mist wall. Before getting through, climb the stairs on the right to find a body and a [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/soul+of+a+nameless+soldier "Dark Souls 2 soul of a nameless soldier"), and 3x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Now, get ready to fight the area's boss and traverse the mist!

BOSS FIGHT: [The Pursuer](/The+Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 The Pursuer")

After defeating the Pursuer, continue forward through the gap in the stone head. Through the hole in the floor immediately ahead, if you down down, you will find the [Drangleic Set](/Drangleic+Set "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Set"), [Drangleic Shield](/Drangleic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Shield"), and [Drangleic Sword](/Drangleic+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Sword"). Continue one more drop and you will be near the beginning of your ascent towards the Pursuer. If you head all the way back up to the room past the boss, past the gap in the floor then go up the stairs to the right you will see a nest which you can use. An eagle will take you to [The Tower Apart](/The+Tower+Apart "Dark Souls 2 The Tower Apart") bonfire in the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille").

### Flame Lizard Pit

_**Note** : this area is relatively high-level compared to the rest of Forest of Fallen Giants; probably one to come back to later._   
If you decide to jump in the Flame Lizard Pit, use the Silver Cat Ring and try to drop down onto the junk at the end of the left side. The [Flame Lizards](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") are quite durable and cause a lot of damage with attacks (4 poison arrows to start the process, will eat about 3/4 of their hp). A high fire defense is recommended, however they have a lunge attack which is unblockable and will knock you down. This is in addition to breathing fire.

There are a total of four [Flame Lizards](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") below, one of which is readily visible and can be taken out with a bow and patience. If you switch the elevator to the Last Giant fight so the side closer to the pit is up, it can be used as a sniper spot for a second [Flame Lizard](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") who can only be seen from certain angles (that's one of them). An archer [Hollow Royal Soldier](/Hollow+Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Royal Soldier") will raise with this side of the elevator so watch out. After the second [Flame Lizard](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") is killed, a small tunnel leads down that he was blocking. Another one is to the right in a large chamber and the last is to the left in a smaller (but still big) side chamber. A locked door (opened using Iron Key) leads to the Last Giant fight (tunnel right before it).

The two [Flame Lizards](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") in the pit can be taken out with a bow by drawing them up partially and taking a few shots. They will retreat at some point and this will need to be repeated. Avoid the flames near the [Flame Lizards](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard"), as they can burn your character, but only if you get very close(The flames will disappear, when you kill the 4 lizards, leaving holes, which are instant death if you jump into them. The flames will be there again, after reloading the level.). In the first section you can find a corpse with a [Firedrake Stone](/Firedrake+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Firedrake Stone"), a skull holding a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight"), a skeleton with the [Hawk Ring](/Hawk+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Hawk Ring") (which seems to be mostly useless) and a chest carrying a [Flame Quartz Ring](/Flame+Quartz+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flame Quartz Ring") +1. In the lower area, a corpse holds [Cracked Red Eye Orb](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb") x2. In the area with the last [Flame Lizard](/Flame+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Flame Lizard") (who tend to drop Cracked Red Eye Orbs as well) there is a skeleton carrying the [Rebel's Greatshield](/Rebel%27s+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Rebel%27s Greatshield") and the [Heavy Iron Key](/Heavy+Iron+Key "Dark Souls 2 Heavy Iron Key").
