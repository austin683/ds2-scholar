**Royal Sorcerer Navlaan** is an [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") in **Dark Souls 2. Royal Sorcerer Navlaan** can be encountered in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia's+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia's Keep"). He is a powerful sorcerer with a dark and malevolent nature, known for his deadly and treacherous ways. **Navlaan** is initially encountered as a locked and sealed door, with the player having the option to release him or leave him imprisoned. If released, Navlaan will task the player with completing a series of assassination missions, targeting specific NPCs throughout the game. However, it is later revealed that Navlaan is actually a malevolent spirit inhabiting the bodies of different individuals, using them to carry out his sinister plots. 

### Royal Sorcerer Navlaan Information in Dark Souls 2

  * DO NOT PULL THE LEVER IN THE ROOM IF YOU ARE PLANING ON DOING HIS QUESTLINE.
  * Navlaan has a split personality depending on if you are hollow when you visit him.
  * Talking to him while Human reveals different dialogue, and the potential to buy items from him. It's only possible to buy items from him after releasing him from the fog gate or after completing his quest chain. (see below)
  * If you visit while hollow you talk to an assassin that requests your help to kill others(NPCs) while he is trapped. He will require an item from each npc to complete the "assassination", but will not remove the item from your inventory. (must be imprisoned behind the fog gate in order to activate this dialogue)
  * You do not have to kill the NPC to receive the item, all can either be bought or attained by other means
  * Royal Sorcerer Navlaan can be released by going to other side of the Keep and pulling the lever. This will cause Royal Sorcerer Navlaan to invade multiple times.) 
    * Using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") will not reverse the fog or his freed state, nor will it revive him (he can easily be killed by enemies following you.
    * Releasing him will cause you to lose the chance of getting one sorcery and one pyromancy that are only obtainable by completing his assassination quest line, which is only available if you talk to him while hollow and he is imprisoned.
    * **Be wary of Navlaan once he is released. He tends to spawn in a most annoying fashion, often spawning near powerful enemies. His attacks can also do decent damage to one caught off guard.**
  * Once you have completed his quest line, he will sell you items **only when you're hollowed,** and if you talk to him he will give you the [Chaos Set](/Chaos+Set "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Set").
  * You can choose to complete his quest line for the rewards, then release him to enjoy him as a vendor while in human form. But he will still invade you.
  * Releasing him will cause him to invade the player at various areas.
  * Killing Navlaan just after you have released him will not add to your level of sin.
  * Killing Navlaan after releasing him prevents him from invading
  * After killing him, he will spawn a gravestone after some time, which can still be interacted with to use his shop, provided you pay the praying cost.

### Royal Sorcerer Navlaan Dialogue

**\- First Encounter (while human)**  
1\. P-please, just stay away.  
No, please, don't come near me. Nothing good will come of it.

2\. Just leave me alone, please.  
Leave this place, and leave me be, as I'd not see any harm befall you.

3\. Please, just leave me alone.

**\- Re-encounter (while human)**  
I haven't said anything strange, have I?  
I have absolutely no intention of leaving here.  
Do not attempt to help me. Just let me sit here, and wither quietly away…

**\- First Encounter (while hollow)**  
1\. Well, you're nicely hollowed, aren't you…  
Are you tormented by memories? Burdened by guilt?  
Now the question. Are you ready for more? If you are, then we ought to talk…

2\. This? This contains my power.  
Long ago…This…naive vessel of mine set about devising new spells.  
The fool dreamt of bringing new forms of magic into the world.  
But instead, he created me. Mostly by chance, but he did a fine job, I must say.  
What he sought was strength. And so, I decided to demonstrate.  
While my vessel slept, I'd find my mark, and hunt him down.  
But my vessel did not approve. And so while I slept, he sealed the both of us away.

3\. Now, I don't have anything against humans, but how is it that you go about defining good and evil?  
I'm only using what the Gods gave me. How can that be so wrong?  
So, what say you to a spot of murder on my behalf?  
If you don't, I'll leave this place, and take more lives. Many more.  
I couldn't give a fig either way. So, what's your choice?

**\- Answering YES to a quest**  
see quest dialog below

**\- Answering NO to a quest**  
Yes, yes, of course. Forget that I asked.  
That's what "good people" do, am I right?  
Your feeble mind can't begin to comprehend me. Not that you've ever tried! Heh heh…

**\- Answering NO to fourth quest**  
Having second thoughts?  
It's your choice.  
Ah hah hah, now you're getting nervous, hmm?

**\- First Quest**  
1\. Yes, I see, how very kind of you.  
I want you to kill a merchant named Gilligan. A greedy, foul man. He won't be missed, I assure you.  
Hmm…Yes… Bring me a Ladder Miniature as proof.  
He's the only person who'd have such an odd knick-knack…Heh heh…

2\. I want you to kill a merchant named Gilligan.  
And don't forget that Ladder Miniature. Heh heh…

3\. Heh heh heh…Fine work.  
This is my thanks. Take it.  
Now, let's discuss our next mark.

**\- Second Quest**  
1\. I want you to kill one more.  
Your target will be Cale, the man who's drafting that map.  
While I was trapped in here, he touched me, that maniac, like I was some rare specimen.  
He wore a strange helm. Bring it back as proof.

2\. Yes, I knew I could count on you.  
Perhaps this will slake my thirst.

3\. I want you to kill Cale, the cartographer.  
Bring his helm as proof.

4\. Heh heh heh…Fine work.  
This is my thanks. Take it.  
Now, let's discuss our next mark.

**\- Third Quest**  
1\. I want you to kill one more.  
You target is Felkin, the hexer.  
As proof, bring me that peculiar sceptre of his.  
What do you say?

2\. Yes, very good.  
But he will be formidable. Be cautious.

3\. I want you to kill Felkin. That's Felkin, the hexer.  
He has that sceptre. Bring it to me as proof.

4\. Heh heh heh…Fine work.  
This is my thanks. Take it.  
Now, let's discuss something of importance.

**\- Fourth Quest**  
1\. You could kill a dozen like that, and it wouldn't matter. I want you to kill someone of import.  
I want you to kill the girl in Majula known as the Muse.  
They say that she is the last Fire Keeper. But they say a lot of things…  
That she's a gentle shepherd, lighting the way for you cursed fools. Nonsense.  
Once she is dead, I will have no regrets, and I will be content to remain here.  
The girl will have a peculiar feather. Bring it to me.  
Now, go along. Heh heh…

2\. Your mark is the girl in Majula known as the muse.  
And don't forget that feather. Heh heh heh…

3\. Yes, that's the feather.  
Good, oh that is very good!  
Your reward, take it. Heh heh heh…

**\- After quests have been completed**  
What do you require?  
You've been good to me. Go on, tell me what you need.

**\- When gifting the Chaos Set**  
These are for you.  
Don't mind the specks of blood…Heh heh heh…

**\- Using Talk option**  
Now I am at peace.  
I will sit here, and watch the world turn. Heh heh…

**\- Leaving after buying items**  
Find what you wanted? Hah hah hah hah…

**\- Leaving without buying anything**  
Well, as you wish. Heh heh…

**\- Leaving without exiting menu**  
Oh, no?

**\- After pulling lever (while human)**  
By the very gods…What have you done…  
You've really done it…You'll never escape him…

**\- After pulling lever (while hollow)**  
1\. Hmgh…  
I hope you appreciate the ramifications.  
Well, no matter. What's done is done.  
Besides, I've found myself a new mark…Gah hah hah…

2\. I'll spend some time travelling the lands…  
Slowly tracking my new mark…

**\- When attacked (while human)**  
Please, stop that!  
What are you doing?!  
You are most intriguing. Heh heh… (aggroed)  
Heh heh heh heh heh… (50% HP, no caption)

**\- When attacked (while hollow)**  
Yes, I see.  
Hmm…  
You are most intriguing. Heh heh… (aggroed)  
Heh heh heh heh heh… (50% HP, no caption)

**\- When killing the player**  
Hmm, ooh…Hah hah hah hah! Not bad at all.

**\- When killed**  
Death…aargh…could be worse…
