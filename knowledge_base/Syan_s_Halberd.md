**Syan's Halberd** is a **[Halberd](/Halberds "Dark Souls 2 Halberds")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Syan's Halberd**, a replica of the loyal knight Syan's weapon, is a meticulously-crafted halberd in Dark Souls 2. Dropped by Syan Soldiers in Drangleic Castle and Undead Crypt, it has a unique feature known as the Sweet Spot Mechanic, where damage is reduced if the weapon's handle connects with the enemy. However, due to its hybrid move set, many of its R1 attacks are not affected by this

### DS2 Syan's Halberd Hints and Tips

  * Has a unique set of attacks compared to other halberds, incorporating several moves from the spear attack set: 
    * First 1H R1 attack is a spear thrust and the second hit follows the regular halberd pattern (which is also a thrusting attack)
    * First 2H R1 attack is a 2H spear R1 attack followed by the first halberd 2H R1 attack (an overhead slash)
    * 1H R2 is the standard Halberd attack pattern
    * 2H R2 is most akin to the alternate spear attack pattern (e.g. [Partizan](/Partizan "Dark Souls 2 Partizan")), first attack is a wide sweep, and the 2nd attack is a relatively fast follow up thrust. Despite the weapon description. the first attack in the 2H R2 Combo is strike damage (similar to the spear attack) and is very useful against enemies vulnerable to that damage type (e.g. [Ironclad](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier"))
    * Running attacks, rolling attacks and quickstep attacks maintain the standard Halberd attack pattern. In particular, the two handed running/quickstep attack is a powerful spinning attack
  * The halberd attacks are affected by the "sweet spot" mechanic, where damage is reduced if the handle of the weapon connects with the enemy. However, due to the hybrid move set of this weapon, many of the R1 attacks are NOT affected by this mechanic, making it a more versatile weapon for players who don't want to carry a backup weapon
  * Can attack with your shield raised.
  * Upgraded with regular titanite.
