**Havel's Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> A helm/armor/gauntlets/leggings as if hewn from a giant boulder. Offers stupendous defense, but weighs a ton.  
>   
> The origin of the name Havel is not clear. Some say it was the warrior who wore the armor, but others say it was the name of a great kingdom ruined in a barbaric war. 

###  Set Location

  * Found in [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"), past a door unlocked with [Forgotten Key](/Forgotten+Key "Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Key"): from the first bonfire, cross a small bridge, turn left, jump down to a ring of sconces and climb the ladder.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Upgraded stats are only 40% higher, not the usual 50%.
  * Chestpiece offers the highest physical defenses (except for strike defense) and the highest poise, as well as second highest bleed resistance (almost equal to that of [Executioner set](/Executioner+set "Dark Souls 2 Executioner set") chestpiece).
  * Gauntlets offer the highest physical defenses, bleed resistance and poise. They are also the heaviest among all gauntlets.
  * Leggings offer the highest physical defenses (except for strike defense) and poise, as well as second highest bleed resistance. They are also the heaviest among all leggings.
  * Set looks different compared to _Dark Souls_ , plus it seems to be made of metal, not stone.
