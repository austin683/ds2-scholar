**Soul Appease** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle.

> "One of the lost miracles preserved only in the Undead Crypt. Inflicts heavy damage on mindless Hollows, but has no effect on anything else.  
>   
> The Undead Crypt is a place of rest for the living. Those afflicted by the curse can only pray to one day gain entrance."

### Acquired From

  * Sold by [Stone Trader Chloanne](/Stone+Trader+Chloanne "Dark Souls 2 Stone Trader Chloanne").
  * Sold by [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne").

### Notes

  * Useful for clearing out some of the groups of basic undead, such as the small mummies around Straid's cell, and the non-crawling Congregation members in the Wandering Magus boss fight, mages, and underwater hollows in Shrine of Amana. Also does very high damage against undead players, but none against human players.

  * Especially useful to clear out the enemies within the shortcuts in Iron Passage. 
  * Very helpful in the Shaded Woods to hit the invisible enemies
  * It's worth noting that this spell has an enormous range, much bigger than the animation suggests which can also hit through walls. Not only that but it also works on more than just humanoid hollows. (E.G. both Royal Rat Bosses and all their rats) If you're an invader and the host is hollow, you can also take full advantage of this spell to use as a PBAoE nuke. Invading with a +6 normal priest's chime, I could easily do over 600 to some hosts.

  * This spell is also effective against **The Rotten**. 

  * Does not work on the Archdrake Pilgrims in the Shrine of Amana.  
The spell's hitbox is dome-shaped and is unlikely to hit enemies situated below the caster's feet.
