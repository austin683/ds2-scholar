_"Sorceress hood from the distant land of Jugo. Appears to be a plain, thin fabric, but is permeated with powerful magic._

_Desert Sorceresses have enchanting looks, and they use them to catch people off guard._  
_Oddly enough, even those who are perceptive enough to realize the ploy fall prey to their seductions with alarming regularity."_

### Location

  * Drops from [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress) in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak).
