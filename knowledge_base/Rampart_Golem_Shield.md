**Rampart Golem Shield** is a [standard shield](/standard+shields "Dark Souls 2 standard shields") in Dark Souls 2. **DLC** or Downloadable Content shields cannot be obtained in the original version of the game, Dark Souls 2.

     _"Shield wielded by the rampart golems, granted life by the Ivory King._

     _The golems were charged with the containment of the creatures of chaos within the boundaries of the wall._

     _When the doors of Eleum Loyce were flung open, the place turned frigid and lifeless, but the golems remained dutifully on guard."_

### Acquired From

  * DLC [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King"): Dropped by the [Rampart Golem](/Rampart+Golem "Dark Souls 2 Rampart Golem") enemy in [Frozen Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Eleum Loyce"). 

### Rampart Golem Shield Hints and Tips

  * Upgrades with titanite to +10.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Extremely fragile, it has only 5 durability making it the lowest of all shields.
  * Either equip [Bracing Knuckle Ring +2](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring"), use [Repair](/Repair "Dark Souls 2 Repair") spell, [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder") or carry multiple duplicates to make it practical.
  * When infused with magic, fire, lightning or dark it has 100% damage reduction to that element, similar to the [Rebel's Greatshield](/Rebel's+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Rebel's Greatshield").
