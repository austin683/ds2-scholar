    | Dark Souls 2 Challenge Runs |
    

  
Chances are you might have been around Drangleic a bit by now, and you might have gotten a bit bored or aggravated by the current trend of hexers and brutes in PvP who make inappropriate gestures at you when you die. If you have, trust me, you’re not alone.   
However, that doesn’t mean you should put down the game just yet. As you will see below, the game never truly ends for anyone – it only gets more challenging. If new game plus wasn’t enough for you the first hell-knows-how-many-times, there are still some challenge runs for you to try out.   
So sit down, relax, and find out some all new ways to indulge your sadomasochistic side!

##  **The No-Bonfire Challenge Run**

  
If you haven’t heard, From Software took one look at the maddened state of the forum goers that had created the ‘No-Bonfire Run’ and decided to, well… run with it. This is one of those runs that doesn’t just give you a sense of accomplishment, it will unlock the [Illusory Ring of the Exalted](/Illusory+Ring+of+the+Exalted "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of the Exalted").   
So what’s the big deal with the ring? The ring in question actually allows for you to turn anything in your right hand invisible, thus making you one of the top five most annoying things in the player versus player world. So have fun on your journey without rest and remember; using this with Santier’s spear might just make you worse than Stalin.

##  **Fist Only Challenge Run**

  
Relatively straight forward, a run that would challenge you to be the next Street Fighter champion. Since the damage of the fists has had a bit of an upgrade since the original game, and since exists, a run through the game without your favorite weapon seems to now be in order. However, keep in mind that rings are still readily available for your bruised knuckles, if you can get to them.

##  **Crystal Mayhem's Human Run**

## 

This challenge consists in venturing into Drangleic as a Human Being, and being so, limited to your own flaws as one.   
Restrictions:

  * You shouldn't use any Bonfires except for the Primal bonfires (e.g. Lost Sinner, The Rotten, etc), as it is something only the Undead can do, and a Human Being may do so only by favor of a Primal Bonfire, which has the remnants of Humanity granted by superior beings.
  * You can't level up, for you have been born Human and the Emerald Herald only grants her favor to the Next Monarch as the Bearer of the Curse, yet thou art pure, and must remain so.
  * You Only Live Once, as you step into the accursed land of Drangleic as an Living One, and your demise should grant you final rest, as one free of the curse of the Unliving. Dying means you're unable to return to the field of glory, and so your journey ends.
  * As a living being, thou art unable to drink the Estus Flask, as it's forbidden and an attic of the Undead. You may still heal yourself with other natural sources, such as Lifegems and other resources you may gather during your Journey.

  
You may choose any class you wish, however, choose carefully. Your beginning stats should be the ones you will carry on until the end of the challenge. No restrictions beyond that. You may upgrade your gear/kill NPC's/Spend your souls on whatever you wish, according to the rules.   
These restrictions will force you into the following conditions:

  * No bonfires means you won't be able to teleport/auto-repair your equipment/Fill Estus/Attune Magic. You may still fix your equipment on a Blacksmith/refill your magics with consumables.
  * No level up means you won't be able to use weapons/equipments made for inhuman strength/dexterity, such as ultra greatswords and things alike. As a common being, you have no proficiency on using that and should rely on your common gear. You may still try even though you have the attribute restriction, if you wish to.
  * 1-life. Nuff said.
  * No Estus Flask will force you to use healing sources that you will have to carry through a long way since you have no bonfires, which will put you into a more dangerous playstyle, as refilling your healing items may cost your souls on merchants, such as lifegems with Melentia the Hag.

  
Good Luck!

##  **No-HUD Challenge Run**

  
An essential part of getting throughout the level is knowing how far you are from dying by the guy in the next room, who might have a weapon that is bigger than you are. This run would take that away removing your health bar, stamina bar, and everything else you confide in when you normally fight your surprisingly slow enemies. Though everything else is permitted to be used, this might bring a bit of a challenge to any new player that has yet to mess around in the options menu.

##  **“Boycott the Blacksmith!” Challenge Run**

  
Has anyone noticed that Lenigrast is right by an open window in Majula when we first see him? Yet, we still have to throw away 1000 of our hard-earned souls. Yeah, screw him; we can get through the game without his fancy and incredibly helpful weapon upgrades. So instead of doing the sensible thing and helping out that other Blacksmith, let’s just make it harder on ourselves and not upgrade our weapons at all. Why you may ask? Well, because this is Drangleic, and the only thing more popular than death is going mad.

##  **The Solo Challenge Run**

  
This is without a doubt directed towards the incredibly new players that used phantoms the first time around in this game. So here it is: Whether we’re talking about NPC phantoms or competent player-used phantoms, you’re connection with them is now gone. Now go through the game again without their help.

##  **Meet the Community Challenge Run**

  
This is a strictly NG+ run right here, seeing as so much player versus player goes on in NG+. For this run you’ll need to grab a ring called ‘Delicate String’ from an odd bloke that you find after the fight with the Undead Chariot. After you’ve entered into your second time through Drangleic, put the ring on and meet the community. Because of the ring, players will start invading you much more frequently, which will definitely hone your PvP prowess – and probably cause you to invent a whole new list of curse words and insults.

##  **The Champion’s Challenge Run**

  
You might know that there is a stone right outside of Majula that let’s you enter a covenant. You might also have figured out the hard way that entering this covenant makes the game enter into NG+ if you’re on NG. So after figuring out that bit of information you probably left the covenant, well start a new game up and join back in you pansy because this whole article is about trying to get you killed as many ways as possible.

##  **The Nude Challenge Run**

  
Assuming you’ve put a lot of hours into this game already you might not have that much shame left in you, so take off your clothes and do it again. You heard me, now that you’ve done this once you should be able to do this again without that shiny armor of yours on. Just think of this as practice for the next challenge run on this list. Enjoy the breeze!

##  **The No-Death Challenge Run**

  
Yup, this is actually possible. In fact, as many know, there is an actual ring that can be unlocked just like the no-bonfire run after completing the game without dying. So hopefully you’ve got some time on your hands so you can sit in your dark room and do this all over again, because the [Illusory Ring of A Conqueror](/Illusory+Ring+of+a+Conqueror "Dark Souls 2 Illusory Ring of a Conqueror") ring makes whatever you’re holding in your left hand become invisible. Totally worth it, right?

##  **The Collector’s Challenge Run**

  
Here to drive you crazy is the second to last run on this list. Here bonfire ascetics will be your best friend and Lucatiel as a phantom will be your worst enemy. Here you’ll find yourself having to collect every piece of armor found within the game whether it be rare, common, or unique armor before you square off with that last boss at the Throne of Want you’ll have all the options to look as fabulous or downright ugly as possible.

##  **The White Hollow Challenge Run**

  
This might be a bit unique to the list, so let me explain a bit about this run. Here you’ll find yourself at a constant health rate of fifty percent so the punishment for death will haunt you throughout the rest of the game. Along with this there are a few other things will also be imposed on you through out the run like:

  * Upgrades for weapons only go up to +5
  * Body and head armor cannot be worn on your character
  * Weapons found throughout the game using different forms of titanite cannot be used, regardless if unupgraded.
  * HUD must be disabled throughout the run.
  * Infusions won’t be available on the run, along with weapons that have already been infused.
  * No starting gift will be available on the run.
  * Magic, Pyromancy, Miracles and Hexes won’t be available for use on the run.
  * Phantoms cannot be used in order to help on bosses or clear out stages.
  * All of the bosses optional and non-optional bosses must be dead by the end of the playthrough.

Also, yes, while this run was in construction I was imagining someone crying over their fight with the Royal Rat Authority while doing this.

Additional challenges by Aaron_Walker for this run (can add any if u want to, I've done all 3) -

  * Perfectly defeating Bosses 
  * RTSR for all boss fights
  * 50% Hollow for all boss fights

The inclusion of all 3 features above makes it **SL1 Broken sword only run with 50% hollow RTSR perfect try on bosses**. The combination is so hard, I've yet to beat the DLC bosses with it. But most of the main game bosses have been beaten. (Smelter demon/Blue smelter demon are a challenge because of their immolation damage on melee range).
