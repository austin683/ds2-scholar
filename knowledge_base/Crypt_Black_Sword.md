###  **Acquired From**

  * Can only be acquired in NG+ and beyond or by using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") in the [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch") in the [Hidden Chamber](/Hidden+Chamber "Dark Souls 2 Hidden Chamber") bonfire.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Reinforced with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5.
  * Uses the [Greataxe](/Greataxe "Dark Souls 2 Greataxe") moveset.
  * By default it deals Dark damage, it can also be infused with [Darknight Stone](/Darknight+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Darknight Stone") and buffed with [Dark Weapon](/Dark+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Dark Weapon"), best for hexers with high Strength, Intelligence and Faith.
  * Once infused with Dark, it deals an obscene amount of Dark damage provided if you have 65 intelligence + Faith above, a perfect melee weapon for hexers.
  * At 45 str/dex, 45 int, and 63 faith, while infused with Dark and wearing Ring of Blades +2 and Dark Clutch Ring, it has an astounding AR of 870 (266+65 Phys damage, 218+320 Dark damage). With Dark Weapon applied that brings the weapons total AR to 1067.
  * It receives S scaling on Dark if infused with Dark.
  * Two-handed strong attack can knock down enemies, like the [Murakumo](/Murakumo "Dark Souls 2 Murakumo").
  * Wielded by [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne") when he's summoned or aggroed.
