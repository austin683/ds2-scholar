**Old Knight Hammer** is a **[Great Hammer](/Great+Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Great Hammers")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. The **Old Knight Hammer** is an ancient [Great Hammer](/Great+Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Great Hammers") wielded by warriors from an era with no recorded history. Dropped by [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") enemies or found in a chest inside [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"), this great hammer has extremely low durability. When two-handing, it is recommended to use the R2/RT for smaller enemies, as the first strong attack is quick and vertical. Additionally, the **Old Knight Hammer** inflicts more poise damage than a typical Great Hammer.

> An undated great hammer.  
>    
> Wielded by a warrior from a time so ancient that there exists no record of his endeavors.   
>   
>  Has extremely low durability  
>    
> Sometimes, just as a thing falls to pieces, it unleashes its last flash of great power... 

###  **Acquired From**

  * Dropped by [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") enemies.
  * This item is located in a chest inside [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle"). After the Double Dragonrider boss, head down the stairs just past the bonfire. You'll come to a small vertical room with what looks like a pillar rising up the centre. Climb the ladder to the right of the door. Once at the top, you'll come to a room filled with the stone knights. There is a door to the right of the room, just through here is two chests. The one on the right contains the hammer.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite"). Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * The hammer attacks very similar to the [Large Club](/Large+Club "Dark Souls 2 Large Club"), or Great Club from Dark Souls 1.
  * When two-handing the hammer and fighting smaller enemies, it is recommended to use the R2/RT rather than the R1/RB as the first strong attack is quick and vertical, whereas the first normal attack is horizontal, and capable of passing over foes.
  * Does more poise damage than a normal [Great Hammer](/Great+Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Great Hammers").
