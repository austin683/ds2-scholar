### DS2 Possessed Armor Sword Hints & Tips

  * Two-handed Alternate Strong Attack buffs this weapon with fire, similiar to [Flame Weapon](/Flame+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Flame Weapon") pyromancy.
  * Buff lasts ~20 seconds.
  * Recommended to infuse with Fire since this weapon has E scaling for STR and DEX while it has C scaling for Fire. Once infused, Fire scaling will reach B.
  * One handed rolling and one handed strong attack is a downward swing similar to the [Bastard Sword](/Bastard+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Bastard Sword"), this is shared by [Red Rust Sword](/Red+Rust+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Red Rust Sword") and many one handed axes.
  * When the weapon is broken, the hot orange area will disappear, and the sword will only resemble blackened steel. Repairing the sword will return it to its original state
  * To easily farm with no risk, open the door by the upper floor bonfire and use the flame traps to burn the Possessed Armor.
  * Using a Great Hammer 2H R2 (**PANCAKE**!) makes for easy farming Possessed Armor anywhere.
  * Care should be taken to use as many items to enhance item discovery as Bonfire Ascetics **DO NOT** revive Possessed Armor enemies; however, being in [Company of Champions](/Company+of+Champions "Dark Souls 2 Company of Champions") **DOES** respawn the [Possessed Armor](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor") enemies.
