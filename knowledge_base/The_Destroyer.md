Strategy:   
For the most part, this build is amazing. BUT, it does not really work well against opponents with high poise. You can use whatever weapons you so choose, but I use what is above. For a strength build, I would recommend the Red Rust Sword. It has excellent scaling in strength (A) and some nice damage. As for spells, I just use warmth. You want to stunlock your opponent to death. A small weapon that attacks quickly and deals good poise damage is ideal. Also, because of you high poise, you can spam parry. I know this is considered bad etiquette by some people, but whatever.
