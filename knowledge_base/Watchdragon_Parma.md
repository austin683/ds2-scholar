**Watchdragon Parma** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A shield decorated by intertwined dragons._

     _The black and white contrast depicts the ebb and flow of the fate of all things living,  
and the serpentine dragons that watch over the march of time._

     _The bearer of this shield will be blessed by great fortune in battle."_
