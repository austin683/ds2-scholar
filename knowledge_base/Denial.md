**Denial** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle. Added with [DLC](/DLC "Dark Souls 2 DLC") | [Crown of the Sunken King](/Crown+of+the+Sunken+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Sunken King")

> An ancient miracle owed to the cardinal of Shulva.  
> Challenge fate one time when HP reaches 0.  
> Originally intended to grant the dying a few moments for a final farewell.

### Acquired From

  * [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon%27s+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon%27s Sanctum")  

    * Inside the circular door near the spike field. The player must shoot arrows at the switch inside the door to open it.

### Denial Notes

  * Once the player receives a lethal blow while this Miracle is active, it instead leaves you with 1 HP left. The effect is similar to Second Chance from Demon's Souls.
  * Does not prevent death from fall damage.
  * Does not prevent death from the giant boulder in Memory of Jeigh.
  * The duration scales with Faith. Lasts 1 minute at 14, roughly 2 minutes at 24, and roughly 4 minutes at 50. (Needs further testing.)
  * This spell is affected by both the [Northwarder Set](/Northwarder+Set "Dark Souls 2 Northwarder Set") and the [Lingering Dragoncrest Ring](/Lingering+Dragoncrest+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Lingering Dragoncrest Ring").
  * [Northern Ritual Band](/Northern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Northern Ritual Band"), [Hexer's Hood](/Hexer's+Hood "Dark Souls 2 Hexer's Hood"), and [Saint's Hood](/Saint's+Hood "Dark Souls 2 Saint's Hood") all increase casts by 1, but they do not stack.
  * Other Body Buffs (like [Sacred Oath](/Sacred+Oath "Dark Souls 2 Sacred Oath"), [Unleash Magic](/Unleash+Magic "Dark Souls 2 Unleash Magic"), [Numbness](/Numbness "Dark Souls 2 Numbness"), [Brightbug](/Brightbug "Dark Souls 2 Brightbug"), and even [Green Blossom](/Green+Blossom "Dark Souls 2 Green Blossom")) override Denial.
  * It also can't be used with Balms.
