**Life Ring** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in **Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)**. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> An old ring set with a red jewel. Raises maximum HP. Each ring has a different power, and even very modest rings can be a great boon on a perilous journey.

### Life Ring Locations in Dark Souls 2

  * Starting gift; chest in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants").
  * +1: This is found in the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") in the same area as the [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon"). If entering the area for the first time the chest containing the ring is in the far left corner at the top of the ladder guarded by a [Alonne Knight Captain](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain"). You can get it easiest by dropping down to the platform after defeating the Smelter Demon or clearing the area.
  * +2: Cavern on the left wall before passageway to third bonfire in [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana").
  * +3: This is found in the [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower"). After activating the elevators near the [Foyer Bonfire](/Foyer "Dark Souls 2 Foyer"), take the coal elevator to the very top. After stepping off the elevator take a left and follow the pathway along the wall of the tower until it ends. Here you'll see another elevator which you need to use to cross over to the other side of the path (at the same level). Follow this short path until you reach a door. The ring is inside the door in an iron chest to the right, guarded by a lava-spewing giant and an [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol").

### DS2 Life Ring Tips and Note

  * This Ring is very useful when using the [Bewitched Alonne Sword](/Bewitched+Alonne+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Bewitched Alonne Sword") buff. You can equip the Life ring+3, use the [Bewitched Alonne Sword](/Bewitched+Alonne+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Bewitched Alonne Sword") buff, then take off the Life Ring+3 and switch it to something else, lessening the load of damage you take.
  * Life Ring +2 has great sinergy with Unleash Magic spell, for those wizard craving more power by sacrificing only 15% health instead of the full 30% taken by the spell.
