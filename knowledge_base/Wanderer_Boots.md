**Wanderer Boots** is a **Legging** and a part of [Wanderer Set](/Wanderer+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Wanderer Boots Description

_"Boots for the roving type.  
Light, sturdy leather made for long journeys."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Starting equipment from the Swordman.
  * [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille): Knock the rock into the well and kill the three mummy enemies, the third one drops the entire set. They do not respawn (Not even with Ascetics). 
    * Note: I did not get the drop. I lured them into the first courtyard, below the Heide Knight. Not sure if that's why...
    * I climbed the ladder in their spawn area and picked them off and it did not drop. I did the same thing on another character though and it did drop. No idea if that affects it.

warning- I killed all 3 mummies before they walked off the cage and the item orb dropped onto the floor of the cage and I could not reach it and the items were lost *The floor of the cage is still reachable if the item ends up dropping there, get back onto the roof by using a Pharros Lockstone in the room with the chest containing the Twinblades. This will give you access to a lift that will take you back up to where you can access the roof again. From the room you can safely walk off onto a wooden beam just above the cage and then walk off that straight onto the cage floor to grab the armour.

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard)
  * Don't blow them up with magic/bomb when they are still in the cage. You can't reach the drop there, not even with jumping. ***It is possible to make the jump into the cage** *
