### White Priest Gloves Description

_"Traditional Headpiece/Robe/Gloves/Skirt worn by Drangleic clerics._

_The clerics of Drangleic were not viewed with particular reverence, and their positions were only preserved as a nod to tradition._

_It is customary for clerics to wear different garb depending on their sex, but the reason for this practice is unknown. This is a men's headpiece/robe/gloves/skirt."_

### Where to Find \ Location

### Notes
