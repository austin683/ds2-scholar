**Executioner (Torturer)** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.   

  

  

_These wicked Torturers don`t wield conventional weapons -- the tools of their trade are intended to inflict pain upon their Undead victims rather than death. If you underestimate them, you`ll find that regardless of their intention, they certainly can kill you._

  
  
  

###  Strategy tips

  

  * There is an easy way to deal with the group of executioners that will gank you through your path to the boss fight, once you defeat the first one in the forest, go through the path, then slowly walk forward until you see the first executioner falls down the pillar then run back to the place where you killed the first executioner and wait until he comes to fight you , then repeat for each one of them, the executioners that use whips will do small amount of damage and if their attacks are blocked with a shield will drain only 5 or 6 stamina compared with the ones with the staff that have an absurd damage for a normal enemy
