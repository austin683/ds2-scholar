**Lizard Staff** is a **[Staff](/Staves "Dark Souls 2 Staves")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Lizard Staff **has good scaling for [Sorceries](/Sorceries "Dark Souls 2 Sorceries"), being especially well-suited for intelligence-based builds. Players can obtain it as a rare drop from [Hollow Mages](/Hollow+Mage "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Mage") in the [Undead Purgatory](/Undead+Purgatory "Dark Souls 2 Undead Purgatory"). It has fast casting speed compared to other high-scaling sorcery catalysts but has low durability

> Staff used by the fallen sorcerers who wander this land. A catalyst for both sorceries and hexes.   
>   
> Particularly well-attuned for sorceries.   
>   
>  The lizard bound to its tip is a simple charm, and has no bearing on the staff's powers.

### How to get Lizard Staff in Dark Souls 2

  * Drop from [Hollow Mage (Black)](/Hollow+Mage+%28Black%29 "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Mage %28Black%29") in [Undead Purgatory](/Undead+Purgatory "Dark Souls 2 Undead Purgatory"). They respawn infinitely so long as you don't kill the boss (quit or homeward bone out), so you can farm it without ascetics.

### DS2 Lizard Staff Hints and Tips

  * While the damage of [Staff of Amana](/Staff+of+Amana#fex "Dark Souls 2 Staff of Amana#fex") (Human form) and [Staff of Wisdom](/Staff+of+Wisdom#fex "Dark Souls 2 Staff of Wisdom#fex") outclasses this staff, the S scaling and damage after infusing is a good consideration.
  * Also it seemly has the fastest casting speed among the all three S scaling Sorcery dedicated catalysts.
  * The only downside is the rather low durability, much close to a sorcery dedicated version of [Sunset Staff](/Sunset+Staff#fex "Dark Souls 2 Sunset Staff#fex").
  * Recommended to infuse with [Faintstone](/Faintstone#fex "Dark Souls 2 Faintstone#fex") since it has excellent int scaling for Magic and mediocre Dark scaling.
  * a minor note, You cannot reanimate skeleton with this staff, it doesn't have the special attack used by its old owners.
  * However, if you're really that desperate, wanting to command skeletons to do your bidding, [Yearn](/Yearn#fex "Dark Souls 2 Yearn#fex") is the spell for you, you can lure them to destructible object to break them.
  * +10 50int with magic infusion reaches 431mag atk.
