### Gyrm Warrior Information in Dark Souls 2

  
Warriors of the Gyrm race clad in heavy armor customized for their stout frames. These sturdy opponents can deal massive damage with their improvised Great Hammers while deflecting nearly any blow with the monstrous stone Greatshields they carry. Some have developed proficiency in ranged combat and will throw enormous Greataxes with frightening accuracy.

The Gyrm seem to have a rank system. A normal Gyrm does not wear heavy armor, and fills the role of blacksmith for the Gyrm race, Gyrm Warriors wear heavy segmented armor and wield a fire-resistant stone shield paired with an axe or greathammer. Elite Gyrm Warriors can be identified by their Gyrm Warrior Greathelm. A friendly Elite Gyrm Warrior, named Gavlan, can be encountered throughout the world; he is an item collector and vendor of poison equipment.

### Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior Strategy Tips

  * Gyrms wielding Great Hammers are incredibly easy to get behind when they begin attacking, allowing ample opportunity for backstabs.  
Gyrms wielding axes will throw them when the player is at a certain distance - these axes have a maximum range, and can be avoided by backing away when they are thrown. After throwing both axes, the Gyrm will rush at the player with its fists, but the attacks are slow and provide opportunity for backstabs.
