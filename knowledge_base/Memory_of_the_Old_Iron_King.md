### Access**  
**

Prerequisites that need to be met:

  * [Tower Key](/Tower+Key "Dark Souls 2 Tower Key") from [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower")
  * [Ashen Mist Heart](/Ashen+Mist+Heart "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Mist Heart")
  * Defeat the [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight")

From the **[Foyer Bonfire](/Foyer "Dark Souls 2 Foyer")** , take the elevator up and then the next one up again. At the top head left to open the door with the [Tower Key](/Tower+Key "Dark Souls 2 Tower Key"). Take another elevator up, and this time turn right. This upcoming area will hold an invasion by NPCs [Prowlers](/Prowlers "Dark Souls 2 Prowlers"), though not all at the same time. There will only be one in the first room along with the [Ashen Idol](/Ashen+Idol "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol"). Destroy them both then claim the [Soul of Nadalia, Bride of Ash (fragment)](/Soul+of+Nadalia%2C+Bride+of+Ash+%28fragment%29 "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Nadalia%2C Bride of Ash %28fragment%29") and continue through the doorway.

At the staircase, the remaining 4 [Prowlers](/Prowlers "Dark Souls 2 Prowlers") will spawn. Make quick work of them to proceed up the stairs, and upon doing so, turn right to see a glowing statue. Go around it and light the [Smelter Throne Bonfire](/Smelter+Throne "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Throne"). Examine the statue to enter the memory....

### Post Alonne

The starting room can act as a hub for player summons; players who don't have the dlc can be summoned in to help you complete this. Additionally, if you instead desire the aid of an NPC, the summon signs of [Steel-willed Lorrie](/Steel-willed+Lorrie "Dark Souls 2 Steel-willed Lorrie") and [Drifter Swordsman Aidel](/Drifter+Swordsman+Aidel "Dark Souls 2 Drifter Swordsman Aidel") are also located here.

Go through the doorway to enter a large room. This room holds many [Alonne Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight") and [Fire Salamanders](/Fire+Salamander "Dark Souls 2 Fire Salamander"). The easiest way to make it out of there alive is to lure the Knights into 1v1 situations while staying out of range of the Salamanders. Once you defeat them all, the first doorway to the left contains a corpse holding 3x [Rusted Coin](/Rusted+Coin "Dark Souls 2 Rusted Coin"), while the three bodies in the middle of the room hold a total of:

  * 5x [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth %26 Silky Stone")
  * 3x [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy")
  * 1x [Skeptic's Spice](/Skeptic%27s+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic%27s Spice")

Go to the end of the room and drop down the hole. Continue to the next room to encounter several [Alonne Knights](/Alonne+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight"), and a [Fire Salamander](/Fire+Salamander "Dark Souls 2 Fire Salamander") below, shooting fireballs. After defeating them, there are two lootable corpses there that can give you 5x [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem") and 3x [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder"), in total.

Take the side stairs to go below, kill the Salamander and 3 Knights there and explore the area for a [Twinblade +7](/Twinblade "Dark Souls 2 Twinblade"). Go through the doorway in the end, down the corridor and enter the fog to commence the boss encounter.

BOSS FIGHT: [Sir Alonne](/Sir+Alonne "Dark Souls 2 Sir Alonne")

After killing the boss, enter the room on the far right and examine the chair for a [Smelter Wedge](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge"). Examine it again to be transported out of the memory.
