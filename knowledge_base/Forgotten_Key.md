### Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Key Location

  * Found by defeating 2-4 (number varies by how many phantoms you have summoned) giants hidden underneath the Black Gulch.
  * From Black Gulch's first bonfire, head left towards the oil pool and the worms. After defeating both worms, look for a ledge (approximately across the second wormhole). A torch is (very) helpful to see the ledge below. After dropping, turn around to see a smaller ledge with a corpse. Turn around again and drop. You will land in a cave opening with the giants just ahead.
  * In the big room with the Giants, if you run along the edge to the left or right, you will reach a room containing a chest with Ring of Giants +1 and Petrified Dragon Bone. And from that room, you can safely snipe them off with a bow or by using spells.
  * They are very weak against poison. The poison damage can reduce them to half health with one complete duration. It takes 4 to 5 poison daggers to get the effect going.
  * If you log out underneath the Black Gulch directly after beating one giant, the key will appear in your inventory upon logging back in.
