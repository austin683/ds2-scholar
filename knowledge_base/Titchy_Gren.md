### Titchy Gren Information in Dark Souls 2

Gren is a devotee of the war god Nahr Alma and introduces the player to the [Brotherhood of Blood Covenant](/Brotherhood+of+Blood "Dark Souls 2 Brotherhood of Blood") if the player has at least 1 [Token of Spite](/token+of+spite "Dark Souls 2 token of spite"). A Token is earned by invading and defeating a player using [cracked eye orbs](/Items "Dark Souls 2 Items") or by finding one in a chest in the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints"). Once the player has pledged allegiance to the Covenant and Nahr Alma, Gren will discuss the Brotherhood mechanics and ways in more depth, and will also become available as a merchant.

  * Killing Gren yields 1600 souls and the Nahr Alma [Hood and Robes](/Gren+Set "Dark Souls 2 Gren Set")
  * Killing Gren also updates [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") to sell his Hood/Robes and [Scythe](/Scythe+of+Nahr+Alma "Dark Souls 2 Scythe of Nahr Alma").
  * You can alternatively get his set and scythe upon reaching Rank 3 in the Brotherhood of Blood covenant and after you used the talk option in his dialog menu.

### Titchy Gren Dialogue

**\- If you do not have a token of spite in your inventory when you first visit**  
What is it?  
Oh, you trot along home. This place won't be any fun, not for you.

**\- First Encounter**  
Ooh, welcome, welcome.  
Do you have a lust for blood?

**\- Answering NO**  
Well, that's no fun…  
Go back home. This is no place for you.

**\- Answering YES**  
Yes, of course, why else would you be here?  
Do you give yourself to Nahr Alma?

**\- Answering YES**  
Then you will need blood, lots of it.  
Undead blood, like your own.  
But it's not as easy as you think! Nah hah hah…  
Well, what'dya say? Join the Brotherhood of Blood?

**\- Answering YES**  
Hmm…  
Well, that can hardly be the whole story.  
I want to hear what you really think.  
You want more than just a little blood.  
You want to be drenched in blood, mired in its foul stench. Am I right? Am I?  
Oh, just say that I'm right! Nah hah hah…

**\- Answering YES**  
Heh heh heh… I knew it, I knew it!  
Fantastic! You're the best.  
Now you are a servant of Nahr Alma.  
This Crest of Blood is yours.  
There! Another servant of blood is born!  
You will serve well, I just know you will! Heh heh…

**\- Re-encounter (if not in covenant)**  
You've done well to find me.  
Do you seek blood?

**\- Answering NO**  
But if you seek Undead blood…I welcome you.

**\- Answering YES**  
 _see chain above_

**\- Re-encounter (when in covenant)**  
Well, how are we?  
Whatever you need, I've got it for you.

**\- Using Talk Option**

  1. Know anything about Tokens of Spite? Well, you can fight other blood servants with them.  
I'll reward you if you win. With red orbs.  
You know, a Cracked Red Eye Orb. Use them to visit other worlds, and seek more blood.  
Tell me if you need anything else.  
I'm very generous. Anything to get you covered in blood.
  2. Have you heard of the Blue Sentinels?  
They're a thorn in our sides, to say the least.  
Their men are obsessed with hunting down blood servants.  
Ah, who cares? It's just another chance to spill more blood.  
Doesn't that excite you, hm? Heh heh…

**\- Re-encounter after abandoning covenant**  
Wait, you've left the Brotherhood of Blood.  
Oh, well. Some people just don't have it in them.  
Bye-bye. Don't loiter for long. You're not wanted here.

**\- Answering YES**  
Hmm…Not that I really care, but…  
Let's see some results next time!

**\- Answering NO**  
 _see NO response above_

**\- After answering NO to re-join**  
I've no use for you any more.  
Trot along home. Heh heh heh…

**\- Leaving without using services**  
Fine, either way. Heh heh heh… (_no audio for laughs_)

**\- Leaving after using services**  
Come back soon. Heh heh heh… (_no audio for laughs_)

**\- Leaving without exiting menu**  
Thirsting for blood? Heh heh heh… (_no audio for laughs_)

**\- When attacked**  
That hurts…  
What are you thinking?  
Trying to spill my blood?  
Well, whose blood will spill first? (aggroed)  
Ooph! Agh! Hah… (50% HP)

**\- When killing the player**  
Oh, it's even on my shoes!

**\- Re-encounter (after aggroed)**  
You are a sad, sad fool.

**\- Reach Rank 1 in the Brotherhood of Blood covenant**  
Heh heh, wow, you're something.  
But don't stop now.  
You can be much nastier than this!

**\- Reach Rank 2 in the Brotherhood of Blood covenant**  
You're incredible, you really are.  
Those who seek blood are driven by a thirst.  
You have it, too, and that's what makes you good.

**\- Reach Rank 3 in the Brotherhood of Blood covenant**  
I couldn't ask for anything more.  
Many Undead are obsessed with blood, but you're beyond the pale.  
You're absolutely despicable! Hah hah hah!  
Go, and seek all the blood that you desire. The rest is up to you.

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
I have to say, you were bloody good. Take these, for all your trouble.  
But see you don't stain them all red. Heh heh heh…

**\- Unknown**  
Do you give your body and souls?  
Here, this is for you.  
Now, go and find some blood!

**\- Unknown**  
Heh heh…Heh heh heh…  
You want blood, I know you do…
