**Mace of the Insolent** is a **[Hammer](/Hammers "Dark Souls 2 Hammers")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Mace of the Insolent** is a weapon upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite"). It can't have Bleed infusion but stands out for its ability to deal all damage types at once when infused with Magic and using [Flame Weapon](/Flame+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Flame Weapon").

> The mace of formerly high-ranking clerics. It is combined with a sacred chime, and can cast miracles and hexes with strong attack. The clerics held venerated positions once, but now, their souls wander aimlessly in the depths of a murky darkness.

### How to get Mace of the Insolent in Dark Soul 2

  * Treasure from [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") \- After fighting two soldiers using greatshields as weapons you'll drop down a hole. From this room, there will be four pathways. One of these pathways will progress forward. Close to this exit there will be a corpse with loot by a knight's gravestone. Mace of Insolent is located on this body.
  * It is possible to get two in one playthrough by using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") on the second bonfire in the crypt due to the weapon being located on the ground near the exit of the room you drop down into filled with the tombstones (rocks) and the Witch Spawners.

### DS2 Mace of the Insolent Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite"). Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * This weapon and the [Drakeblood Greatsword](/Drakeblood+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Drakeblood Greatsword") are the only two weapons in the game capable of inflicting all damage types at the same time. You can achieve this by infusing with Magic and using [Flame Weapon](/Flame+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Flame Weapon") on it.
  * Its Strong Attack can be used to cast [Miracles](/Miracles "Dark Souls 2 Miracles") or chime [Hexes](/Hexes "Dark Souls 2 Hexes") .
  * Unlike catalysts, the Insolent Mace can be buffed. Exactly like the [Blue Flame](/Blue+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Blue Flame") but with miracles.
  * Due to its stronger scaling in Dark, it is probably more sensible to use this weapon for hexes rather than miracles.
  * At least one Mace of the Insolent must be equipped in order to have two weapons buffed with the same miracle or chime cast hex at the same time.
  * The stamina consumption for spellcasts it is significantly higher than with an actual chime.

### Mace of the Insolent Powerstance

  * When Mace of the Insolents are powerstanced, the left handed strong attack will function as it would with regular maces. The regular right hand Strong Attack will remain able to cast miracles and hexes. This is the only known way to power-stance whilst also able to cast miracles and chime hexes.
  * Due to the low stat requirements, even when powerstancing and ability to cast while still powerstanced using r2, it makes it an incredible weapon for both PVP and PVE and due to the ability to buff it unlike other chimes, your miracles and hexes can also be affected by the buff. For example, when I buffed it with [Resonant Weapon](/Resonant+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Resonant Weapon") at +10 Dark, [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Great Resonant Soul") was doing as much damage as a +10 Dark Caitha's Chime, allowing you to use it without equipping other chimes. Even without a buff, a +10 Dark or Lightning allows your Miracles or Hexes to be incredibly powerful. The only downside is that it has the same moveset as a Mace, even when powerstancing making PVP with it without using Hexes or Miracles difficult unless you are experienced with using a mace in PVP.
  * Due to the nature of spell damage being affected by buffing. Under the full strength, if you have 50 int and 50 faith above, casting [Sunlight Spear](/Sunlight+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Spear") combined with [Sunlight Blade](/Sunlight+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Sunlight Blade") with +10 Lightning deals 1000+ damage on almost every target with low lightning resistance, also works on [Climax](/Climax "Dark Souls 2 Climax") if buffed with [Resonant Weapon](/Resonant+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Resonant Weapon") and +10 Dark. damage output will now be similiar to a standard chime, however, since it also functions like a mace, making it a formidable catalyst if left on good hand.
  * While Power Stanced, you can still cast Miracles and Hexes with R2. Combo'ing Force(especially), Miracles and Hexes(only chime Hexes) into your hits is extremely effective in both PVE and PVP. At 22 Strength, 15 Dex and 30 Intelligence and Faith I was hitting for 600+ while power stanced on two Dark Insolent Maces +10. This was without Resonant Weapon applied to both.
  * L2 while power stanced is a normal mace combo, it's slow but incredibly strong, and with Resonant Weapon on both at Dark+10 I hit an enemy for 1.4k and then did a quick cast Great Resonant Soul for 1.6k. This was against another player.
  * It is recommended you use R1 to stun other players before using your L1 / L2 Power Stance combos as it costs less stamina and is often faster.
