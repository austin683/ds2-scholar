### Pharros' Contraption Notes, Tips & Tricks

  * Doors unlocked by lockstones reset upon entering NG+.
  * Pharros' Contraptions do not seem to be reset by using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). However, some chests will be reset with whatever item they previously contained. In other words, the loot respawns, but you do not need another Lockstone to access it. Bear in mind that this does not happen for all chests located behind Pharros' Contraption walls. Only wooden chests and mimics are respawned by Bonfire Ascetics. Metal chests require an actual NG+ activation to respawn.
  * Some Pharros' Contraptions, particularly those located at [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") can only be reset by using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") bonfire.

**Glitches**

  * Using a Pharros' Contraption while being summoned may consume the lockstone and render the contraption unusable. Seems to only happen to contraptions that have animations, like the doors in Doors of Pharros or the bridges in the Grave of Saints.
