**Witchtree Bellvine** is a **[Sacred Chime](/Chimes "Dark Souls 2 Chimes")** and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Witchtree Bellvine** is a special Sacred Chime crafted by outcast clerics for casting miracles. While it's slower than the [Priest's Chime](/Priest's+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Priest's Chime"), it's a good option for those who mix miracles and hexes. It's particularly effective with darkness.

> Witchtree bellvine that sprouts amongst old growth. A catalyst for miracles and hexes.   
>   
>  Clerics who were ostracized devised this as an alternative catalyst for casting miracles.   
>  Most clerics who were stripped of their status are good-for-nothings, but among them are powerful spell casters who represented real threats to the establishment.   
>   
>  Although not a proper catalyst, the bellvine is quite powerful. 

### How to get Witchtree Bellvine in Dark Souls 2

  * The Witchtree Chime is obtained through the Forgotten Door in the well in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). After obtaining the [Forgotten Key](/Forgotten+Key#fex "Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Key#fex") from the giants in [Black Gulch](/Black+Gulch "Dark Souls 2 Black Gulch"), descend down the ladder into the well, and climb up the metal ladder on the landing. The room has three chests, holding [Soul Vortex](/Soul+Vortex#fex "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vortex#fex"), the [Witchtree Branch](/Witchtree+Branch#fex "Dark Souls 2 Witchtree Branch#fex") and Chime, and the [Great Lightning Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear#fex "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear#fex") spell.
  * You can acquire the Chime earlier by dropping from the pit using the planks. After reaching the last platform right before the first cave opening, drop from the right side of the plank to fall on the platform where the metal ladder is located. Use the Silvercat Ring and lower your equip load to reduce fall damage. Note: You will still need the Forgotten Key to access the room.

### DS2 Witchtree Bellvine Hints and Tips

  * [Priest's Chime](/Priest%27s+Chime#fex "Dark Souls 2 Priest%27s Chime#fex") is better for pure miracle casters due to its higher casting speed. Therefore, this chime is generally only useful to those who attack with hexes at least some of the time. It sacrifices the casting speed for better hex power.
  * Upgraded with regular Titanite
  * 390 lightning bns with 50 faith.
