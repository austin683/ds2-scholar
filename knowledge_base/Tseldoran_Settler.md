### Dark Souls 2 Tseldoran Settler Notes and Tips

  * It seems that the Duke has raised Freja from when she was small, as the broken cage around his study cage suggests. This could also mean that he had no intentions of releasing the spiders upon his dukedom, as it seems the release was accidental.
  * It is suggested that the Duke at some point came in contact with the remains of Seath the Scaleless' and possibly his study. The Duke used the Old Paledrake Soul and arcane research that might have been from the time of Seath to create Freja and her spider broods. This is also supported by the dead petrified Dragon hanging over the boss arena and the fact that Tseldora was famous for it's Crystals, also connecting him to the mad Seath. In the end both were driven insane by the work they did, as Duke Tseldora was hollowed by the time you got there.
