### Dark Souls 2 Hollow Primal Knight Information

One of the original Primal Knights, this ragged creature went Hollow long ago and now wanders mindlessly with its equipment in tatters from long years of neglect. First created through a dark and forbidden ritual in ages past, the Primal Knights are artificial creatures contrived by a twisted and power-hungry mind. Their susceptibility to the Undead Curse, a trait they share with humans, raises foreboding questions about the rituals through which they were given life…

A healthy, living Primal Knight. These peculiar but unquestionably mighty creatures were recreated by King Vendrick through a long-lost forbidden ritual most likely rediscovered by Lord Aldia; they have been used as guards at Drangleic Castle ever since their revival. The existence of Undead Primal Knights suggests that they are susceptible to the Curse and leads one to wonder if these monstrous beasts were themselves once human…
