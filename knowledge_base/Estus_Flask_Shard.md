### Estus Flask Shard Usage in DKS2

These items are used to increase the amount of uses your [Estus Flask](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask") will provide. The [Emerald Herald](/Emerald+Herald "Dark Souls 2 Emerald Herald") in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") is the only one who can do this.   
The Estus Flask can only be upgraded 11 times, providing a total of 12 uses. There are 12 shards scattered around the worldmap, but only 11 are needed to max out the Estus flask.

#### [Brightstone Cove Tseldora:](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora")

  * From the Chapel Threshold bonfire, head back towards the church. Instead of going inside, head to the right and jump off. Follow your way down the platforms towards the bottom, where a priest guy shooting spells at you is, standing in front of an entranceway (near where the mass of spiders come from). Inside that little room is the Shard.

  * On a corpse after the [Skeleton](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") in the basement of the mansion, after you obtain its [key.](/mansion+key "Dark Souls 2 mansion key")

  * After gaining the [Soldier Key](/Soldier+Key "Dark Souls 2 Soldier Key"), go up the stairs in the [Cardinal Tower](/cardinal+tower "Dark Souls 2 cardinal tower") and open the door there. In the second room, you will find a chest with a Shard and a [Small White Sign Soapstone](/Small+White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 Small White Sign Soapstone"). 
    * Alternatively, you can attack the door until it breaks.

#### [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille")

  * In a metal chest Behind [McDuff's Workshop Bonfire](/McDuff%27s+Workshop "Dark Souls 2 McDuff%27s Workshop"), there is however no quick path from that Bonfire to the Chest unless you've already made the trip and opened the portcullis. On the other side of the portcullis, there's a courtyard, there is a gap between the wall (left) and the path to the portcullis, and through that gap, you'll find the chest. 
    * If you follow a hidden wall path from the room under Straid's Cell, you can complete two jumps and be able to access the shard as well as the first bonfire. Jump onto the platform with the corpse holding an item, then with a bit of luck, you can land on the wall of the rampart above where the chest is.

#### [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Forest "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Forest")

  * One found in a room opposite the Old Akerlarre bonfire.
  * One found in [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex")'s locked room. Requires the [Fang Key](/Fang+Key "Dark Souls 2 Fang Key") to open the door into the room containing the Shard.  
How to find this room; Start from the the Shaded Ruins bonfire; 
    * Run past the [Great Basilisk](/Great+Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Great Basilisk") to the open area with 1 [Lion Clan Warrior](/Lion+Clan+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Clan Warrior") and 1 [Cursed Vessel](/Cursed+Vessel "Dark Souls 2 Cursed Vessel"). The ground under the Vessel will break if you or an NPC walks on it. You can jump down the hole and you will be right in front of the door, but be wary of the 4 [Basilisks](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") waiting below for you.
    * Head to the same open area as before but go past the hole as well and past the next Lion Warrior. Instead of going into between the 2 towers, walk past it into a grassy area, among that area there's another fall trap, this one takes you down onto the plateau, and from there you may walk down the corridor to the locked door. Be careful of the pools in the corridor as they degrade equipment very fast.
    * Following the bridge from the bonfire, hug the left side. If you look off the edge you can see a hole in the wall usually used to exit the cave. With a light enough burden, you can jump into the hole from the bridge.

#### [No-Man's Wharf](/No-Man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-Man%27s Wharf")

  * In a chest inside a one-story building, to the left of the stairs that leads down to the side of the docks with the ship. There are two sleeping [Hollow Varangian (Varangian Sailor)](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") and numerous poison jars. The item is contained in a metal chest at the corner of the room.

#### [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley")

  * After the second bonfire, move towards the windmill, progress until you meet your first [Hammersmith (Undead Steelworker)](/Hammersmith "Dark Souls 2 Hammersmith") (Fat green hammer wielder), and take the path to the right. After clearing the room with pots and 2 more Hammersmiths. Proceed through the doorway. Turn right, down through the corridor filled with poison, the shard is located at the end. 
    * Setting the windmill on fire in the next area also drains this hallway of poison.

#### [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora")

  * Before the boss fight [Prowling Magus and Congregation](/Prowling+Magus+and+Congregation "Dark Souls 2 Prowling Magus and Congregation"), there is an illusionary wall to the left of the boss's fog wall with the shard inside.
  * The second is on a corpse in a building opposite the lower brightstone bonfire.

#### [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle")

  * In the room with a gated door, past the large room with 4 [Alonne Knight Captains](/Alonne+Knight+Captain "Dark Souls 2 Alonne Knight Captain"), 2 [Syan Soldiers (Royal Guard)](/Syan+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Syan Soldier"), and a [Primal Knight (Mastodon)](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight").

#### [Shrine of Amana](/Shrine+of+Amana "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Amana")

  * Between the second and third bonfires down the path blocked by an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre"), an [Amana Aberration](/Amana+Aberration "Dark Souls 2 Amana Aberration") (Lizard Man), and 2 [Amana Priestess](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess")[es](/Amana+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Amana Priestess") (Amana Shrine Maiden). The path becomes very narrow and snakes, so use caution when navigating.
    * You can use the Pillars to intercept the projectiles, hide, and move from pillar to pillar (if you want you can wait until they stop shooting before you move to the next one). This way you can bring a torch to spot the path.
