_"Hood worn by the Archmaster of Aldia._

_Several of the greatest minds converged in Aldia to weave strange new rituals, but rumors suggest that during the course of their work their thoughts were not their own.  
The nebulous face of the mask is designed to deflect the ire of the ritual sacrifice."  
_

### Location

  * Drops from [Giant Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") inside Aldia's Keep.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Dragon Acolyte Set](/Dragon+Acolyte+Set "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Acolyte Set").
  * Adds 1+ to [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith") and [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence").
