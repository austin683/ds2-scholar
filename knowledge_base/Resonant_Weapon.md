**Resonant Weapon** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> "A hex developed independently by Outcast Felkin. Transforms a certain amount of souls into attack power over a period of time.  
>   
> Something gained, something lost.  
>   
> Catalyst: sacred chime"

### Acquired From

  * [Felkin the Outcast](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast") for 4000 souls

### Notes

  * The strongest Weapon Buff in the game, but only slightly more so than Dark Weapon and its equivalents.
  * Buffs weapon with dark damage. Superior to [Dark Weapon](/Dark+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Dark Weapon"). Costs 2000 souls to cast, losing effectiveness if the price isn't met. Duration scales with Faith (as it is cast from a Chime): 45 sec. at 24 faith, and up to 72 sec. at 36 faith.
  * DS2's buff formula differs from other Souls games, instead relying primarily on the targeted weapon's base damage to determine how much AR the spell buff will add. Matching the spell buff with a damage type present on a weapon will add a flat bonus to the total AR, depending on whatever the weapon is infused with and/or naturally inflicts said damage type. A small scaling bonus is also added unless the targeted weapon doesn't scale at all with any stats.
