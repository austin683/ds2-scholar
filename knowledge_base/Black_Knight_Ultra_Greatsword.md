### DS2 Black Knight Ultra Greatsword Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5.
  * Moveset is identical to [Zweihander](/Zweihander "Dark Souls 2 Zweihander").
  * Minimum Power Stance requirement is 45 Strength and 24 Dexterity.
  * Oddly enough if you infused it with anything from Magic to Bleed, the Fire Parameter scaling remains a slightly better C indicated by the blue coloring of the letter when choosing infuse type, and at maximum upgrade rank it's better than the regular upgrade, being B instead of C.
  * Extremely formidable Fire weapon especially if infused with [Firedrake Stone](/Firedrake+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Firedrake Stone") and buffed with [Flame Weapon](/Flame+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Flame Weapon").
