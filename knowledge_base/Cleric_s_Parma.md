**Cleric's Parma** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** and Standard Shields can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A parma used by clerics on pilgrimage.  
Enchanted with a somewhat fragile blessing that allows spells to be deflected by parrying._

     _Unfortunately, the shield provides very little physical defense,_
     _and is more of a lucky charm than a proper shield."_
