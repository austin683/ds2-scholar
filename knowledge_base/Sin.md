#  Sin

###  Sin Levels

  * "-" = 0 - 9 sin
  * "Sinner" = 10 - 99 sin
  * "Wretch" = 100+ sin

  
Note: Your Sinner level is displayed in the "player info" screen.   
Alternatively, the [Lost Sinner's Sword](/Lost+Sinner's+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner's Sword") can be used to determine sin level below 10 points.  
When sin level is 'Wretch', you can go below 50% hp when fully hollowed.

#  Gaining Sins/Penalties

* * *

**Things that do add sins:**

  * Sinning increases your chances of being invaded by arbiter spirits ([Blue Sentinels](/Blue+Sentinels "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinels"))
  * Arbiter spirits can invade you after your sin level reaches "sinner" (10 points of sin)
  * When an [NPC](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") dies and souls are gained, no matter the cause, 1 point of sin is added.
  * Invading using the Cracked Red Eye Orb and successfully defeating the host adds 1 point of sin
  * Being killed by an [ arbiter spirit](/Blue+Sentinels "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinels") removes 1 point of sin
  * Dying with an Arbiter Spirit on the map removes 1 point of sin, regardless of whether your death was caused by the arbiter spirit
  * Sin does not reset after completing a play through
  * [Cromwell the Pardoner](/Cromwell+the+Pardoner "Dark Souls 2 Cromwell the Pardoner") does not reset your sin level. His pardon mechanic only removes the aggro from hostile NPCs. However, due to a glitch that erroneously caused sin in the [Crown of the Ivory King DLC](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King") during Patch 1.08, Cromwell was changed to offer 1 pardon for free. Unlike the regular pardon described above, it completely clears all types of Sinner statuses. It can only be done once per character.
  * Using the Crushed Eye Orb to invade and kill [Licia of Lindelt](/Licia+of+Lindelt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindelt") increases sin by 1.

**Things that don't add sins:**

  * Completing Royal Sorcerer Navlaans questline without killing the NPC's does not increase your sin level by 1 (Tested while hollow with Lost Sinner's Sword - completed by showing him all items)
  * Killing or attacking Vendrick or the Ancient Dragon does not count as sin.
  * Killing an arbiter spirit does not count as sin.
  * Dueling as a Dragon Remnant or Bell Keeper does not count as sin.
  * Causing other players deaths in a coop session through environmental means does not count as sin.

* * *

**Unconfirmed/Untested:**

  * Can sin be lowered back down to "0" by getting killed by an arbiter spirit, while playing as a white/gold phantom?
  * Sin can be lowered by helping defeat a boss as white/gold phantom? *Had "Sinner 10-99" level, full hollow, did one boss fight as a White Phantom and had no sin and became human upon returning to my game. *Seems to be incorrect, tested with lost sinner sword and exactly 10 sin, tried to kill a boss as both a white and gold phantom with no decrease in sin.
