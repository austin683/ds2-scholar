_"Top of the Manikins of Harvest Valley. A fickle queen gave them life, and tore off their faces._

_How else could she forgive those who dared gaze upon her?"_

### Location

  * Drop from Manikin in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak).

### Notes

  * Part of the [Manikin Top](/Manikin+Top).
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite+Slab).
  * Very high physical defense/weight ratio, so very good choice for a lightweight piece of armor if you cannot take on much more weight.
