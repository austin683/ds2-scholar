**Priestess Skirt** is a **Legging** and a part of [Priestess Set](/Priestess+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Priestess Skirt Description

"Robe worn by Drangleic clerics."  
"The clerics of Drangleic have retained their status throughout the ages, but were always at arms length from the royal family, as if their existence was little more than a formality."  
"It is customary for clerics to wear different garb depending on their area, but the reason for this practice is unknown...  
This is a woman's robe."

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Drop from Manikin in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak)

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite Shard, Large Titanite Shard, Titanite Chunk, Titanite Slab](/Ores)
  * From Software had to change the mask design due to legal issues with Naruto (Anime/Manga) Which is probably also why manikins we meet ingame are headless. Maybe Fromsoft had no time or desire to redesign their heads with new mask. (Source needed.) 
    * You can download a mod for the game (on nexusmods) and edit the texture to the same, as it was in the trailer of DarkSoulsII. 
      * Download: (As every texture mod, it requires )
  * Very high physical defense/weight ratio, so very good choice for a lightweight piece of armor if you cannot take on much more weight.
