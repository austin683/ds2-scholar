### Destructive Greatarrow Usage in Dark Souls 2

  * Inflicts break damage on enemies
  * Like any other Greatarrow, it can only be used with [Great bows](/Greatbows "Dark Souls 2 Greatbows").
  * They seem to have very high armor penetration. 
    * Confirmed to do more damage than Iron Greatarrows at the least. Tested on Mastadon Warriors at Drangleic Castle in NG with Alonne Greatbow +10, 29 Strength, and 25 Dexterity. Iron Greatarrows did 379 damage, Destructive Greatarrows did 443 damage. Tested on several other enemies, and the damage difference remained consistent. This means that Destructive Greatarrows are superior to Iron Greatarrows despite the latter having twice the damage according to stats. Therefore, the stats are very misleading in this case.
