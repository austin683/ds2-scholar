#  Walk lightly carry a big hammer

[Build](https://fextralife.com/calculator/dks2builds.html?rhpmnW4zK.qsEX1h04.djKAd4nO.NoFgJaDc.A.A.XEUKAy8pm)   
This is a STR/INT build I've been running with in SOFS, it's pretty overpowered, it really starts to shine around 148+. The link above has my current setup and gear, basically you're good at taking down stuff from far away, and crushing in melee. The Great Giant club has magic infusing at +10 with 60STR/50INT can 2-3 hit the ivory mobs in the DLC and most anything else, backstabs are about 1700, later on will probably start building into faith to make a total badass along with putting more into VIT and END perhaps to make a Havel monster.
