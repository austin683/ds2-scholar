**Grave Warden Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
  
  
_Hood changed to: "Hood worn by a Grave Warden sorcerer. The man claims to have sealed himself away, but who's ever heard of sentient magic?_   
_It is no doubt difficult to judge the veracity of the man's words, but this hood certainly seems to possess an unusual power."_   
_"Robe/Gloves/Leggings worn by a Grave Warden sorcerer. He calls himself Navlaan, now."_

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Grave Wardens](/Grave+Warden) and [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Earthen Peak") and [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Undead Crypt").

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Titanite").
  * Robe offers second highest poison resistance (almost equal to that of [Northwarder](/Northwarder+Set) and [Tattered Cloth](/Tattered+Cloth+Set) robes).
  * The armor is reminiscent of the Ancient Egyptian clothing, which slightly resembles that of the connection between the Grave Wardens and Agdayne, Guardian of the Undead Crypt, because Agdayne wears clothing similar to those found in Ancient Rome, and Ancient Rome expanded its territory into Ancient Egypt during Augustus Caesar's reign.
