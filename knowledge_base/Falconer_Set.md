**Falconer Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
_"Helm (Armor/Gloves/Boots) worn by the Volgen Falconers."_   
_"Domestic Volgen soldiers are infamously timid, so it is no wonder that this fierce band of mercenary falconers was hired to compensate._   
_In practice they serve as bodyguards for the affluent elite, and they serve well, such that nobody dares scrutinize their backgrounds."_

###  Set Location

  * Starting gear (no helmet) for Knight class.
  * Sold by [Maughlin the Armourer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer) (4'650).
  * Dropped by [Falconers](/Falconer "Falconers") in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods) (left path) and in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Brightstone Cove Tseldora"). On NG+, Falconers are also found at the very start, in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt).

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Titanite").
  * Most likely a reference to "Band of the Hawk" mercenaries from the Berserk manga, seeing as the armour description mentions "mercenaries who became famous in service of a nobles" matches the mentioned group from the manga series, as well as because of falcon/hawk symbolism.
