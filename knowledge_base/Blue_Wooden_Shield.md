**Blue Wooden Shield** is a [standard shield](/standard+shields "Dark Souls 2 standard shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Wooden shield used from ancient times._

     _Inferior to metal shields in terms of stability and physical damage reduction,  
but easy to use and weighing so little that it hardly requires any strength to bear."_

### Acquired From:

  * From [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") (Cardinal Tower Bonfire), exit through broken wall shortcut and descend downwards to the area where you meet [Pate](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate"). Before reaching Pate, hug the right wall until you see an opening in the wall with ballistae pointing immediately at the entrance in a crescent shape. The shield is one of the lootable items in the room.
