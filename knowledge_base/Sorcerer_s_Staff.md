### DS2 Sorcerer's Staff Hints and Tips

  * With the second highest base casting speed in the game, use spells that have many casts to take advantage of this.
  * Also a passable catalyst for buffs in PVE, like magic weapon and magic shield. Better for mid boss fight casting.
  * When compared with Witchtree Branch, Sorcerer's staff excels better as a hex staff than magic while Witchtree Branch is better for magic since its weaker than Sorcerer's in dealing hex.
  * Confirmed that at higher SL's(80 int/fth), the Sorcerer's Staff outdamages other staves that are a B for both intelligence and faith which means the Sorcerer's staff does the best B scaling for all staves, despite having other staffs being more powerful or scale better, it is very notable indeed for its 135 cast speed and B scaling mastery.
  * 357 magic bns when infused with 52 int, if you desire speed this is easily outclassed by witchtree.
  * 361 dark with 30/30
