### DS2 Staff of Amana Hints and Tips

  * Bonus AR is influenced by Hollowing level: the higher the hollowing. the lower the bonus AR
  * Upgraded through normal titanite.
  * The formulas to define the Bonus AR of the Staff of Amana are:  
  
Normal infusion:  
  
Magic Bonus AR: normal Bonus AR - hollowing addtive  
normal Bonus AR = Magic BNS * 1.05 (this version of the staff has 105% magic scaling)  
hollowing additive = hollowing level * (20.8 + (0.094 * Magic BNS))  
The final result is rounded down  
  
Dark Bonus AR: normal Bonus AR - hollowing addtive  
normal Bonus AR = Dark BNS * 0.55 (this version of the staff has 55% dark scaling)  
hollowing additive = hollowing level * (20.6 + (0.05 * Dark BNS))  
The final result is rounded down  
  
Both Magic and Dark Clutch rings lose buff quantity gaining hollowing, starting from +30 down to +3. Average diminishing is 2.7 for each hollowing level.  
  
Magic infusion:  
  
Magic Bonus AR: normal Bonus AR - hollowing addtive  
normal Bonus AR = Magic BNS * 1.21 (this version of the staff has 121% magic scaling)  
hollowing additive = hollowing level * (23.8 + (0.109 * Magic BNS))  
The final result is rounded down  
  
Dark Bonus AR: normal Bonus AR - hollowing addtive  
normal Bonus AR = Dark BNS * 0.47 (this version of the staff has 47% dark scaling)  
hollowing additive = hollowing level * (17.46 + (0.043 * Dark BNS))  
The final result is rounded down  
  
Both Magic and Dark Clutch rings tested at 200 BNS provide +34 and +25 bonus AR. They lose buff quantity gaining hollowing, down to +4 and +3. Average diminishings are 3 and 2.2 for each hollowing level.  
Both Magic and Dark Clutch rings tested at 19 Int (200 Magic BNS and 112 Dark BNS) provide +34 and +26 bonus AR. They lose buff quantity gaining hollowing, both down to +3. Average diminishings are 3.1 and 2.3 for each hollowing level.  
  
Dark infusion:  
  
Magic Bonus AR: normal Bonus AR - hollowing addtive  
normal Bonus AR = Magic BNS * 0.89 (this version of the staff has 89% magic scaling)  
hollowing additive = hollowing level * (17.6 + (0.08 * Magic BNS))  
The final result is rounded up  
  
Dark Bonus AR: normal Bonus AR - hollowing addtive  
normal Bonus AR = Dark BNS * 0.635 (this version of the staff has 63.5% dark scaling)  
hollowing additive = hollowing level * (23.836 + (0.0568 * Dark BNS))  
The final result is rounded down  
  
Both Magic and Dark Clutch rings tested at 200 BNS provide +26 and +34 bonus AR. They lose buff quantity gaining hollowing, down to +2 and +3. Average diminishings are 2.4 and 3.1 for each hollowing level.  
Both Magic and Dark Clutch rings tested at 19 Int (200 Magic BNS and 112 Dark BNS) provide always the same +26 and +34 bonus AR. They lose buff quantity gaining hollowing, both down to +3. Average diminishings are 2.3 and 3.1 for each hollowing level.  
  
  
Hollowing level is a hidden stat but the player can keep track of that: basically it's 0 when the player is human and everytime the Curse (or death) reduces Max HP the hollowing level goes up by 1. Max hollowing level (50% of Max total HP) is 10 although through oberservation and tests it appears that being hit by petrification can bring that value above 10; that is just for trivia though, the max influence of hollowing is at 10, after that no more variations are applied.  
  
Values were calculated as follows:  
First, keep track of magic and dark bonus AR at the variation of BNS stats and hollowing. Mentioned tests were made with 99 Int/Fai and 19/99 Int/Fai.  
The diminishing in bonus AR seemed quite linear with 200 Magic BNS, so basically you sum the total difference of AR from 0 hollowing to 10 hollowing and divide it by 10 (hollowing levels, or steps tracked). For magic AR the total difference was 396, divided by 10 it's 39.6 for each level of hollowing. At 19 Int, (100 Magic BNS), total difference was 302, divided by 10 it's 30.2.  
So, I needed to define a hypothetical function such as bonus AR is influenced by Magic BNS and hollowing at the least, since changing those values in fact the bonus AR changes.  
Having 200 and 100 Magic BNS, you can define 2 equations stating:  
39,6 = 200a + b  
30,2 = 100a + b  
where a and b seem to be constant values (needed confirmation whether these 2 values are related to any stat)  
By solving this equation system, you get a = 0,094 and b = 20.8  
As stated above, when you calculate the values it seems you have to round the result down to the nearest integer value. Most results seem to match the ARs tracked down in the game. Same for the dark side of these data.
