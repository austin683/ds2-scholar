**Chaos Storm** is a [Pyromancy](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Chaos Storm** , harnessed from the chaos flame that consumed the mother of pyromancy. Conjures multiple pillars of chaotic flame. [Pyromancies](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies") are offensive fire spells that do not demand [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith") or [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") prerequisites and can be executed with a [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") or [Dark Pyromancy Flame](/Dark+Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pyromancy Flame"). The fire damage scales with [Intelligence](/Intelligence "Dark Souls 2 Intelligence") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"), yet there are no specific stat requirements for casting pyromancies. However, opponents resistant to fire damage remain unaffected by [Pyromancy Spells](/Pyromancies "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancies").

### Chaos Storm Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * The easiest way to safely retrieve Chaos Storm without dying is to coat yourself in water from the urns, found on the upper level leading to the roof, and then casting Flash Sweat*.  
Doing so will reduce the damage to a point in which you can easily counter it with healing items and estus.  
Wearing the [Pharros Mask](/Pharros+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Pharros Mask") helps when it comes to walking along the lava paths. The water effect the mask provides reduces fire damage.  
Equipping armor with high fire defense and a Flame Quartz Ring will reduce the damage further and might be necessary if you have low base health.  
**Note:** Keep in mind that Flash Sweat and Small Orange Burrs won't stack. Instead, they will override the previous applied effect.
  * Only the first hit deals the full damage to the enemy. Every following hit from from the same cast deals significally less damage (~20% of original).
