**Bows** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a type of ranged [Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") that allows the player to have direct control over aiming. Players are usually used to the lock-on system but with Bows, they can aim down manually, which can help in trying to strike a specific part of the body. With this, Headshots automatically deal critical damage, even against some [Bosses](/Bosses "Dark Souls 2 Bosses"). Ammunition is required for Bows to be used, there are different types of ammunitions for different Bows, and these will affect the range, damage type, as well as overall amount of damage. This page covers a list of all Bows in Dark Souls 2. Arrows fired are not effected by [Flynn's Ring](/Flynn's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flynn's Ring").
