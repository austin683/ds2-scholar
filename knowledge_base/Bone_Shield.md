**Bone Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing. 

     _"Shield used by Aldian acolytes. Crafted from the skull of some creature that outlived its usefulness for experimentation._

     _The peculiar figure known as Lord Aldia kept Giants in his manor,  
and attempted to recreate a dragon, but after some time, was not heard from again."_

### Acquired From

  * Rare drop by [Dragon Acolytes](/Dragon+Acolyte "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Acolyte") in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Aldia%27s Keep").

### Bone Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Generally, this shield is inferior to [Drakekeeper's Shield](/Drakekeeper%27s+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper%27s Shield") while both having the same weight.
  * Despite being inferior, the relatively low strength and dex makes it a good shield for low level builds or casters when two handed.
  * Not to be confused with the [Cursed Bone Shield](/Cursed+Bone+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Cursed Bone Shield"), a small shield capable of spell parrying, this shield cannot parry spells.
