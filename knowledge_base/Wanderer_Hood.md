_"A hood for the roving type.__Light, sturdy leather made for long journeys."_

### Location

  * Starting equipment from the [Swordsman](/Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Swordsman").
  * [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"): Knock the rock into the well and kill the three mummy enemies, the third one drops the entire set. They do not respawn (Not even with Ascetics).
    * Note: I did not get the drop. I lured them into the first courtyard, below the Heide Knight. Not sure if that's why...
    * I climbed the ladder in their spawn area and picked them off and it did not drop. I did the same thing on another character though and it did drop. No idea if that affects it.
  * SOTFS: Knock the rock into the well, the set is on a corpse on the elevator that the mummies ride up.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Wanderer Set](/Wanderer+Set "Dark Souls 2 Wanderer Set").
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard").
  * Don't blow them up with magic/bomb when they are still in the cage. You can't reach the drop there, not even with jumping. ***It is possible to make the jump into the cage** *
