Shape up! Shape up, I say!
  3. Oh-hoh hoh hoh! That's it, yes, that's the way!  
Dear flame…how brightly you burn! Meh heh heh…
  4. I ought to fetch a new ember…

**\- After Obtaining Dull Ember**  
Flame flame…I smell flame upon you.  
I'm McDuff the blacksmith; all I want is a little flame.  
So, hand that ember to me.  
Right now, you imbecile.

**\- Answering YES**  
Oh-hoh! What a marvellous ember!  
You've got stones, I pray.  
Give me stones, and I'll fortify your gear.

**\- Answering NO**  
What?!  
Hmph! Oh, do it yourself, then!

**\- Using Talk Option**

  1. Flame, dear flame…  
I give you my all, and you waver and falter.  
Meh heh heh…
  2. From the start of time, flame allowed man to flourish.  
And even now, he devises new fiery arts.  
But…His reason makes him doubt flame.  
And so we waver…and falter…

And so, flame allures us, and we attempt to harness its power.  
Flame, dear flame…

Enough with you.  
You've offended the flames! (aggroed)  
You scared yet? (50% HP)
