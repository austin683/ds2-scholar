**Resonant Soul** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> "A hex that distorts the power of life.  
> Emits a dark mass at the cost of souls.  
>   
> Can be used even without souls, but at a greatly reduced strength.  
>   
> Catalyst: sacred chime"

### Acquired From

  * Purchased from [Felkin the Outcast](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast")for 1100 souls
  * Pilgrims of the Dark rank 1 Reward.

### Notes

  * Costs 100 souls per cast for maximum damage. Tested at full power, when compared to Dark Orb, it deals 20% more damage, has a 50% higher range and projectile speed, and a slightly extended cast time. One benefit is that it is cast using a chime, and the best chimes are better than the best staves for hexing (having either higher damage, higher speed, or both). It is a less powerful version of Great Resonant Soul.
