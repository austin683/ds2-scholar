The **Blue Sentinels** are a PvP covenant in **Dark Souls 2**. The Blue Sentinels protect the weak, by wearing the [Guardian's Seal](/Guardian%27s+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Guardian%27s Seal") ring that allows them to be summoned to members of the [Way of the Blue](/Way+of+the+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Way of the Blue") when they are being invaded. Sentinels cannot attack or interact with regular [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") in the host's world, as their objective is to defeat the invader and punish the guilty. Sentinels get a red eye indicator that floats above their head upon being summoned and proceeds to guide them to the invader no matter where they might be. Upon defeating the host's invader the Sentinel will receive 1 [Token of Fidelity](/Token+of+Fidelity "Dark Souls 2 Token of Fidelity"). Sentinels don't have to wear the ring to invade guilty worlds or to start a duel match. You must be human to protect [Way of the Blue](/Way+of+the+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Way of the Blue") members.

  
**Covenant Leader** : [Blue Sentinel Targray](/Blue+Sentinel+Targray "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinel Targray")   
**Where to Join** : [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue"), after defeating [Old Dragonslayer](/Old+Dragonslayer "Dark Souls 2 Old Dragonslayer")

## How to Join Blue Sentinels

Talk to [Blue Sentinel Targray](/Blue+Sentinel+Targray "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinel Targray") after having obtained a [Token of Fidelity](/Token+of+Fidelity "Dark Souls 2 Token of Fidelity") either through helping another player defeat a boss as a white phantom or by finding the one on the corpse beneath the rope bridge in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse").   
  
Blue Sentinels is the only covenant that can use [Cracked Blue Eye Orbs](/Cracked+Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Blue Eye Orb"), which allow them to invade the worlds of sinners and wretches. They have to be human to be able to use these orbs. A player becomes a sinner if they have gained 10 points of sin by killing other players online with invasions or by killing NPCs. They become a wretch after gaining 100 points of sin. When a Blue phantom defeats a sinner or a wretch, they will lose 1 point of sin. When using the [Cracked Blue Eye Orb](/Cracked+Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Blue Eye Orb"), Blue phantoms are unable to use healing items such as the [Estus Flask](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask"), but they can heal themselves with [Spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").   
  
You can farm [Cracked Blue Eye Orbs](/Cracked+Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Blue Eye Orb") in many ways:

  * Common drop from Old Knights at [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame"). 
  * Drops from multiple other enemies.
  * Possibly given when exchanging [Small Smooth & Silky Stones](/Small+Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth %26 Silky Stone") with Dyna and Tillo.
  * Can be obtained by winning a sparring match in the [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue").
  * You can buy unlimited orbs from [Blue Sentinel Targray ](/Blue+Sentinel+Targray "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinel Targray") for 10.000 souls each in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus").  
(Can not use bonfire ascetics for NG+ to get orbs in SOTFS)

### Dueling

Much like the [Brotherhood of Blood](/Brotherhood+of+Blood "Dark Souls 2 Brotherhood of Blood"), Blue Sentinels can also gain devotion by defeating other Sentinels in duels. To enter a duel, pray at one of the three statues by [The Blue Cathedral](/The+Blue+Cathedral "Dark Souls 2 The Blue Cathedral") bonfire. At least one [Token of Fidelity](/Token+of+Fidelity "Dark Souls 2 Token of Fidelity") (rather than a [Token of Spite](/Token+of+Spite "Dark Souls 2 Token of Spite")) is required. This will be consumed upon entering the duel. It will not be consumed if you leave the statue before finding a match or if your opponent disconnects before the duel begins. Each statue leads to a different arena:

  * **Left** : A labyrinthine arena with 2 levels. Each side has a ramp to reach the upper level, and the lower level can be jumped down to.
  * **Center** : A cross-shaped bridge over a bottomless pit. Careless duelists often fall to their deaths in this arena.
  * **Right** : A wide-open arena with stairs to a lower level. Relatively few obstacles or hiding places.

If a match is not found in the chosen arena, you will be matched with a duelist in another arena.   
Just as in the Brotherhood, most offensive items can be used in the arena, but most healing items cannot. You still can heal by casting healing miracles such as [Great Heal](/Great+Heal "Dark Souls 2 Great Heal") or the healing pyromancy [Warmth](/Warmth "Dark Souls 2 Warmth"), or by certain equipment like the [Ring of Restoration](/Ring+of+Restoration "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Restoration"), [Loyce Shield](/Loyce+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Loyce Shield"), [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King"), and upon each successful hit of the [Butcher's Knife](/Butcher%27s+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Butcher%27s Knife").

### Rank

To obtain ranks in this covenant, you need a certain amount of victories. In this case, a victory means either:

  * Vanquish dark phantom when [summoned](/Guardian%27s+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Guardian%27s Seal") as help by a [Way of the Blue](/Way+of+the+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Way of the Blue") host: Devotion to covenant up +1. [Patch 1.10](/Patch+1.10 "Dark Souls 2 Patch 1.10")
  * A won duel in the [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue").
  * Defeating a sinner when you invade using a [Cracked Blue Eye Orb](/Cracked+Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Blue Eye Orb").

  
  
You won't ever lose these victory points or ranks.
    
    
    | Rank | Requirement | Reward |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0 | Initial | Guardian's Seal |
    | 1 | 50 victories | Spirit Tree Shield , aesthetic blue aura as a Blue phantom |
    | 2 | 150 victories | Wrath of the Gods , aesthetic neon blue glow as a Blue phantom |

### Covenant Items

  * [Guardian's Seal](/Guardian%27s+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Guardian%27s Seal"): Has to be worn (while human) to be able to get summoned to [Way of the Blue](/Way+of+the+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Way of the Blue") members who are being invaded.
  * [Token of Fidelity](/Token+of+Fidelity "Dark Souls 2 Token of Fidelity"): Required and consumed when dueling with a fellow covenant member. Can also be used as an item to restore some HP. Obtained by defeating invaders or bosses in co-op.

### Notes, Hints, and Tips

  * Talking to [Blue Sentinel Targray](/Blue+Sentinel+Targray "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinel Targray") after reaching rank 3 will cause him to give you his armor set.
  * Even if you are a Blue Sentinel you still can be invaded by an Arbiter Spirit (Blue Phantom).
  * As your rank increases the blue aura that surrounds you when you invade will grow at rank 1 and 2.
  * You can be summoned to defend a [Way of the Blue](/Way+of+the+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Way of the Blue") member while your white summon sign is down.
  * You can also be summoned if you're wearing the ring while resting at a bonfire, so it's a smart move to unequip this ring before going AFK.
  * A way to gain souls via this covenant is either protecting a host or killing Phantoms when invading.
  * A way to get summoned more frequently with the [Guardian's Seal](/Guardian%27s+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Guardian%27s Seal") is by removing the ring and putting it back on with about one to five minute intervals.
  * When invading the world of a sinner, it's possible to arrive in a different area than the one where you used your [Cracked Blue Eye Orb](/Cracked+Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Blue Eye Orb").
  * While invading in [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide%27s+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide%27s Tower of Flame"), it is common for there to be [Cracked Blue Eye Orbs](/Cracked+Blue+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Blue Eye Orb") dropped from mobs, thus nullifying the cost to invade.
