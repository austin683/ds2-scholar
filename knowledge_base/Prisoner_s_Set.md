**Prisoner's Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Rags worn by imprisoned Hollows. This appears to have been worn on the head/body/arms/hip.  
>    
>  Judging by its looks and apparent virtues, this really is no more than a tattered scrap of cloth. It still carries the stench of a Hollow.

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Hollow Prisoners](/Hollow+Prisoner "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Prisoner") in [No-Man's Wharf](/No-man's+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man's Wharf"), [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman's+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman's Copse"), [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Dark Souls 2 Harvest Valley"), [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"), [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") and [Frigid Outskirts](/Frigid+Outskirts "Dark Souls 2 Frigid Outskirts").
  * Prisoners in Harvest Valley and The Gutter drop alternative versions of Hood and Tatters.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Hood and Tatters (all versions) raise [drop rate](/Mechanics+Research "Dark Souls 2 Mechanics Research").
  * Alternative Hood and Tatters are full mask (instead of half-mask) and thin strap over the right shoulder (instead of wide strap over the left shoulder). These pieces differ in starting stats, but are identical to regular versions in upgraded stats.
