**Dyna and Tillo** are an [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs") in **Dark Souls 2.****Dyna and Tillo** are a pair of crows who reside in a nest in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt"). They are known as **“The Crows of the Outskirts”** and players can trade certain items with them by dropping them into their nest. In return, the crows will sometimes give the player rare or valuable items. This trading mechanic adds an element of unpredictability and discovery to the game, as players must experiment with different items to see what the crows will offer in return. 

### Dyna and Tillo Information in Dark Souls 2

_“You! You! Give us Smooth! Yes! You! Give us Silky!”_   
_Give them something silky and smooth._   
  
Twin sisters residing in the ancient forest. Though they never show themselves to humans, and their true forms remain unknown, Dyna and Tillo are enamored of all things silky smooth and will cheerfully call out to passersby in hopes of adding new trinkets to their collection.   
  
Dyna and Tillo reside in the bird's nest on the cliff just past the Fire Keeper's Dwelling Bonfire in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt"). To reach them you must enter the first Fog Gate on the left and proceed along that path until you exit through another Fog Gate onto a ledge. The nest is directly to the left, adjacent to a ladder which can be kicked down to allow an easy return. To trade an item to Dyna and Tillo, simply **drop it in their nest using the “Leave” option** (**do not select “Discard” or you will permanently lose the item without placing it on the ground**). If the sisters accept what you have offered them, the trade will take effect immediately and the item you left will be instantly replaced with the one you are given in return; **there is no need to quit to the title screen** as in previous Souls games. Dyna and Tillo do not offer fixed rewards for specific items and instead will randomly select a reward from their list regardless of what they received from you; however trading them a [Petrified Something](/Petrified+Something "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Something") has the highest chance of yielding more valuable results such as [Titanite Slabs](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab"), [Petrified Dragon Bones](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"), and the [Demon's Great Hammer](/Demon%27s+Great+Hammer "Dark Souls 2 Demon%27s Great Hammer"). Also, you can only drop one of the specified items at a time otherwise the birds will say “No, no not like that” regardless of whether it was a correct item or not. You don't need to pick up items before dropping a new one, you just drop multiple stacks of a single item, and they all get traded at the same time.

  * Found in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt")

  * They squawk and sound like Snuggly the crow from Dark Souls 1 and Sparkly the crow from Demon Souls that you could trade with.

  * Depending on what you offer increases your chance to receive a higher tier item, although _**it is entirely possible to receive any item from any of the below lists**_**.** All the information here was taken from the official guide, though likely needs to be adjusted based on testing.

  * You can drop all your stones without opening the menu to speed up the process, but if you drop stacks of items Dyna & Tillo will reject them.

  * When trading large amounts of trading items (20 or more) at a time, the frame rate can drop significantly (on consoles). As such, it is advised to trade a maximum of ten items at a time.

### Dyna and Tillo Encounters in Dark Souls 2

You can find them in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt"). From the bonfire outside the Old Firekeepers house, head towards [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). Take the first fog door on the left and bear left. You will eventually come across the nest. Be sure to knock the ladder down to create a shortcut.
