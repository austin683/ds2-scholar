### DS2 Chaos Rapier Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") to +5
  * 1-handed strong attack is replaced with a parry animation, useful for power-stancing rapiers.
  * This weapon can be dropped from the singular Mutant Hound in the Cage making it an easy way to farm for this weapon from the Ritual Site bonfire.
  * This was intended to be a weapon for [Felkin the Outcast](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast") in concept art, instead of [Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan").
  * It is probably best to not infuse this weapon, and leave it untouched. When infusing it with fire, the weapon sees a minimal boost in the base fire damage, with a drastic decrease in physical damage. When infused with bleed, the weapon oddly acquires an S rating in fire scaling, however the actual scaling is practically the same, and all base damages were already decreased, leaving you with something that's not better than it was before.
