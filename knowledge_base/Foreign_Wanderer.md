## Foreign Wanderer Information

_"Hollow Travelers appear to be undead that sought a cure for the curse, much like the player. However, they succumbed to hollowing before they could fulfill their purpose  
Hollow Travelers possess light weapons like daggers, bows, or none at all. They also wear very little armor, so they are minor threats; even to inexperienced players  
Hollow Travelers deal negligible damage with their fists and arrows, but the dagger wielding ones may leave more of a scratch_ _"_
