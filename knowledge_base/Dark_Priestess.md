**Dark Priestess** is an [enemy](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. The **Dark Priestess** , a Hollowed Drangleic priestess encountered in the Dragon Shrine, is a variant of the Hollow Priest. Despite its name, this entity wears the Priestess Set, and interestingly, the wearer is a male hollow. The Dark Priestess focuses solely on casting lightning magic and never employs dark magic. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Dark Souls 2 Dark Priestess Information

_A Hollowed Drangleic priestess found in the Dragon Shrine. The reason for her presence there is unclear. Did she journey to the shrine in search of a cure for the Curse, or was she a resident responsible for performing holy rites? As there is no way of knowing this now, it is best simply to put her out of her misery._   
  
Caster who allies with and protects the [Drakekeepers](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper"). Will continually attack with lightning orbs. Lightning orbs do minimal damage yet they have an area of effect and can knock the player down, causing players to be vulnerable to any Drakekeepers nearby, fairly harmless at early NG but fairly annoying at later NG+ onward, so killing her should be at top priority.   
  
Despite the name, it is simply a [Hollow Priest](/Hollow+Priest "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Priest") variant wearing [Priestess Set](/Priestess+Set "Dark Souls 2 Priestess Set"), while the wearer is actually a male hollow, both only casts lighting magic and never cast Dark magic.   
  
[Merciless Roenna](/Merciless+Roenna "Dark Souls 2 Merciless Roenna") is believed to be a former member of Dark Priestesses modified into an [Aldia Warlock](/Aldia+Warlock "Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock"), while the other Aldia Warlocks also wear a darker version of Priestess Robe and they're modified into Fenito.
