### Acquired From

  * Acquired from trading a [Petrified Something](/Petrified+Something "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Something"), [Small Smooth & Silky Stone](/Small+Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth & Silky Stone") or [Smooth & Silky Stone](/Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Smooth & Silky Stone") with [Dyna and Tilo](/Dyna+and+Tillo "Dark Souls 2 Dyna and Tillo") in the [Thing's Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt#.U2He-fldWSo "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt#.U2He-fldWSo")

### Hints and Tips:

Upgrades:

  * Follows normal upgrade path (Shards -> Large Shards -> Chunks -> Slab) unlike many other unique weapon types.

  
Two-Handed Strong Attack's buff:

  * Provides a **5** % boost to attack power for **15** seconds to self and nearby allies as a [Body Buff](/Buffs+&+Debuffs "Dark Souls 2 Buffs & Debuffs")
  * Uses 11 durability
  * Only triggers near the end of the dance. If the dance is cancelled by an action, durability is consumed but no buff is provided.

  
One-Handed Strong Attack:

  * The trident's tip rapidly spins, repeatedly applying three hits. This triple attack is fully affected by weapon buffs such as Bleed and Poison and can critically hit with the [Engraved Gauntlets](/Engraved+Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Engraved Gauntlets"). 
  * When dual-wielded with another spear, the strong attack appears to utilize the tridents unique spinning R2. However, this is merely a visual and hits only a single time like any other dual wielded spear

PvP

  * The two-handed buff **will affect friendly mobs** in the [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints") and in the [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros") if you are in the [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant").
  * Infusing this weapon with poison and using the one-handed R2 stacks poison extremely effectively- especially so when combined with the Rat Covenant Ring, it is considered to be the best thrusting weapon for inflicting poison.
  * Pairing this weapon with the [Stone Ring](/Stone+Ring#fex "Dark Souls 2 Stone Ring#fex") is highly recommended, as it will eat through an opponent's stamina very quickly if they are blocking with a shield.
  * Pairing this weapon with the [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring#fex "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring#fex") is recommended because it has very low durability, and using the one-handed R2 attack will deplete durability quickly.
  * Using the buff dance is very risky and only gives a small, temporary damage increase while decreasing the weapon's durability. Only use the dance if you are in a place where it will not get interrupted, and in a place where allies will receive benefit.
  * This weapon might be more effective if used as a poker in the left hand; using the one-handed R2 with its long range has little risk of counter-attack- give it a try!
  * The twirling attack is incredibly prone to being parried as each hit can trigger a parry and its attacks in general are very easily evaded and punished with a back stab.
