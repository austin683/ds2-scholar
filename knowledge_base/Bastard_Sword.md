### How to get Bastard Sword in Dark Souls 2

1\. Treasure in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). Note that you must kill area boss first. Directions:

  * Go down the ladder from the second Bonfire in the Forest of Fallen Giants.
  * Facing the ladder, turn to your left; kill the bridge and feinted hollow soldiers.
  * Continue past where the feinted hollow was sitting; turn left and through a short hallway.
  * On the other side of the hallway, turn right and go through a locked door (using the soldier key you get from killing the boss in this area).
  * Go down the stairs and then straight down a long hallway with torch sconces (Hollow Soldiers and Turtle Knights).
  * At the end of the hall, follow it left through another door. Watch yourself here for Turtles and Hollows
  * Go straight across the short bridge and open up the door straight ahead (to another Turtle Knight).
  * Go through the doorway on your left, careful of the Hollow Infantry x2 ambush.
  * Continue left around a large pile of wooden boxes and on a body is the [Bastard Sword](/Bastard+Sword "Dark Souls 2 Bastard Sword").
  * In SOTFS, the Bastard Sword will be on top of the same building where you would normally find it, although there is 3 [Ironclad Soldier](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") around it. In the same area, a red phantom will spawn, Armorer Dennis. He his not an easy phantom to kill. He will not spawn if you do not try to get the bonfire or the wooden chest with the Leather Set inside it.

  
2\. Dropped from bastard sword wielding hollows in the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants").   
3\. Sold by [Steady Hand McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff") for 3000 souls (only one).
