### Shrine of Winter Walkthrough

### Access

The gate to **Shrine of Winter** will open once you've obtained the four [Old Souls](/Old+Souls "Dark Souls 2 Old Souls") and lit four **Primal Bonfires**. The souls of [The Rotten](/The+Rotten "Dark Souls 2 The Rotten"), [The Lost Sinner](/Lost+Sinner "Dark Souls 2 Lost Sinner"), [Old Iron King](/Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Old Iron King"), and [Duke's Dear Freja](/The+Duke%27s+Dear+Freja "Dark Souls 2 The Duke%27s Dear Freja"), need to be collected. 

Alternatively the above requirement may be bypassed by obtaining a certain amount of [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory") in your current playthrough. It is important to understand that this is not your total [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory"), but the Soul Memory obtained during your current NewGame playthrough. The number required to pass through the Shrine of Winter starts at 1,000,000, and increases by 1,000,000 for each successive NewGame, capping at 8,000,000 for NG+7. For example, If you start New Game++ with 3,000,000 [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory") you will be required to obtain another 3,000,000 to make it a gran total of 6,000,0000 [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory") for the Shrine of Winter to open in your current playthrough. Consuming hard souls from previous NewGames will contribute to the total [Soul Memory](/Soul+Memory "Dark Souls 2 Soul Memory") required to pass through the **Shrine of Winter** in your current NewGame playthrough. 
    
    
    | NewGame State | Souls Required |
    | --- | --- |
    | NewGame | 1,000,000 |
    | NewGame+ | 2,000,000 |
    | NewGame++ | 3,000,000 |
    | NewGame+++ | 4,000,000 |
    | NewGame+4 | 5,000,000 |
    | NewGame+5 | 6,000,000 |
    | NewGame+6 | 7,000,000 |
    | NewGame+7(cap) | 8,000,000 |
    

### The Shrine

Inside the Shrine, you'll also find the portal that takes you to the [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King") DLC.  
  
The path here is linear. After you go down the slope, turn right to pick up a [Soul of a Hero](/Soul+of+a+Hero "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Hero"). Head back and continue to follow the path until you approach two [Roaming Soul](/Roaming+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Roaming Soul") and grab the [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing") from the nearby corpse. Continue forward to find another corpse holding a [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier"), and a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). After crossing the tunnel, follow the path up and defeat several [Royal Soldiers.](/Royal+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier") Note that the rain here is not only for visuals, but actually drenches you in water, which causes your fire resistance to rise, but your lightning resistance to fall, which should be remembered as some of the Soldiers will shoot lightning infused bolts at you. Behind the boulder ahead, you'll find a corpse containing 2x [Holy Water Urn](/Holy+Water+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Holy Water Urn"). Just before the bridge there will also find a [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard"), holding a very nice 3x [Titanite Chunk](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk"), and a [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab"). Follow the path across the bridge to reach [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle").
