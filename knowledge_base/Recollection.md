**Recollection** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2 created by the [children of Dark](/Children+of+Dark "Dark Souls 2 Children of Dark"). To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> Hex created by the children of Dark. Fire multiple Dark orbs that seek their target.  
> Hexes that grant a fleeting volition to Dark have existed from ancient times, and it appears that the children of Dark have some recollection of the creator of these spells.
> 
> Catalyst: staff

### Acquired From

  * [Brume Tower](/Brume+Tower "Dark Souls 2 Brume Tower"), in the room above where the [Scorching Iron Scepter](/Scorching+Iron+Scepter "Dark Souls 2 Scorching Iron Scepter") is found. The room has several doors with smaller rooms. In one of these rooms, Recollection can be found on a corpse.

### Notes

  * Meorrow: [Walkthrough to the spell's location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGSkTbfcpXo)   
_[Please respect these video posting guidelines](/Youtube+Partners "Dark Souls 2 Youtube Partners")_
  * The hex variant of [Soul Shower](/Soul+Shower "Dark Souls 2 Soul Shower") and [Blinding Bolt](/Blinding+Bolt "Dark Souls 2 Blinding Bolt"). Shoots skull orbs that track into the enemy. Very useful for setting up spells in PvP, for example, [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Great Resonant Soul").
  * Since the skull orb looks identical to the one of [Whisper of Despair](/Whisper+of+Despair "Dark Souls 2 Whisper of Despair"), one can cast Whisper of Despair subsequently after casting this spell to debuff the target.
