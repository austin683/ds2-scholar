**Heide Knight Greathelm** is a [Helm](/Helms "Dark Souls 2 Helms") in Dark Souls 2.

_""Greathelm worn by Heide Knights"  
"Whether Heide refers to a kingdom or was just a name for the land is not clear, for no records date back far enough to tell.  
All that is known is that the Way of Blue has its origins in Heide, and that Heide was later subsumed by the sea."_

### Location

  * [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") NG+(only) (or by Bonfire Ascetic)

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite Shards,](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores") [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard"),[ Titanite Chunks, Titanite Slab](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores")
  * Best way to get the set is to kill the knight that is in Lost Bastille. (Exile Holding Cell bonfire. Short walk to the knight from the bonfire, with only one enemy in the way.) Using a greathammer will make this simple, as your heavy attack will stunlock the red phantom and the Heide Knight. (Only present in Vanilla).
  * Despite its name, the [Heide Knight Iron Mask](/Heide+Knight+Iron+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight Iron Mask") does not belong to this set
  * The Greathelm is a decent item for dressing as Solaire of Astora from  _Dark Souls_ , although the helm is an entirely different design, and it doesn't have the red feather at the top.
