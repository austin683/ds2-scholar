**Hexer's Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Hood worn by a hexer. Grants slight increase to spell uses. Belonged to Felkin the Outcast.  
> Hexing appears to be an offshoot of sorcery, but its specific origins are unknown.  
>   
> Robes/Gloves/Boots worn by a hexer. Belonged to Felkin the Outcast.  
>    
>  Those who have a taste of dark are drawn into its vortex and rarely return. Perhaps it appeals to something deep within the human soul.

###  Set Location

  * Acquired from [Felkin the Outcast](/Felkin+the+Outcast "Dark Souls 2 Felkin the Outcast") in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman's+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman's Copse") after talking to him while having 20 INT and 20 FTH ([Ring of Knowledge](/Ring+of+Knowledge "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Knowledge") and [Ring of Prayer](/Ring+of+Prayer "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Prayer") do not count).
  * Purchased from [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") (18,6k) if Felkin is killed.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Hood increases the number of casts by 1 or by 10% and grants +1 to INT and FTH.
  * Robe and boots offer the highest fire defense (equal to that of [Chaos](/Chaos+Set "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Set") robe and boots).
  * Gloves offer second highest fire defense (almost equal to that of [Chaos](/Chaos+Set "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Set") gloves, [Syan's](/Syan's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Syan's Set") gauntlets and [Tattered Cloth](/Tattered+Cloth+Set "Dark Souls 2 Tattered Cloth Set") manchettes).
  * This set offers lower dark defense than Chaos set and is identical to it in all other stats.
  * Robe oddly makes all gauntlets appear smaller.
