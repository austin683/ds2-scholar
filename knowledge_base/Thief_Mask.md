_"A full face mask. Called a thief mask since most people wearing them are up to no good. Not terribly effective as armor."_

### Location

  * Sold by [Laddersmith Gilligan](/Laddersmith+Gilligan).

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Ores).
  * The 'Thief Mask' looks dramatically different on male and female characters. The male version covers all but the eyes, whereas the female version is a small mask that only covers the mouth.
