**Deprived** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki") **is a **[Starting Class](/Starting+Classes "Dark Souls 2 Starting Classes")**. The **Deprived** is meant for players who prefer to have equal stats on all aspects at the start of the game. It starts no Weapons, Armor, and items at the start of the game. The [Starting Classes](/Starting+Classes "Dark Souls 2 Starting Classes") of **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki") **will only give you a head start on certain stats.

### Deprived Class Build for Dark Souls 2

The build that is listed below is a set of equipment and recommended stats that we see fit for the Deprived Class in Dark Souls 2. For more builds, check out our [PvE Builds](/PvE+Builds "Dark Souls 2 PvE Builds") and [PvP Builds](/PvP+Builds "Dark Souls 2 PvP Builds") pages to find various builds that have been created by the Fextralife team and its community.

_**Melee/Ranged Lightning Build**_

  * This is one of the good **Deprived** builds that you can find in the [PVE Builds](/PVE+Builds "Dark Souls 2 PVE Builds") page made by "Arnaud".
  * First, raise STR and DEX to be able to wield Heide sword. This will be your main melee weapon. Raise DEX to use a bow if you want, but in this build, bow is only to lure enemies at long distance. Later in the game, when you will find good shields with 100% damage reduction, you can go for 16 STR if needed. Raise ATN to have your first slots. Later in the game, raise it until 40 to benefit for greatests miracles. Raise FTH up to 54 whenever you can (mixing with VGR and END) it will raise you damage with miracle and sword of heide with no need for dexterity or strength.

### Notes and Tips About Deprived

Notes:  This is a class for advanced players   
  
The sole advantage of the Deprived (beyond Soul Level 1 runs) is the flexibility that they offer, able to become any kind of character equally well. Especially relevant is that they can use soul vessels to totally change their direction without any of the inefficiency that there would be for other characters. However, this comes with the disadvantage of being forced to have all stats at at least 6, even those that aren't valued to certain kinds of character. For players with a specific build in mind and no inclination to change away from it, the pre-built characters offer greater specialization but less flexability because the pre-built classes can drop their stats very low in unimportant (for the class) stats and spend the points on more valuable areas. For example, if you are trying to build a non-caster where intelligence, faith and attunement aren't important, a pre-built Bandit will have far better stats when he starts than a Deprived at the same soul level because his INT is 1 and ATT is 2, with those points being distributed across other physical stats. While a Bandit starts at SL11, he has 22 stat points in stats greater than 6 meaning that for a Deprived to match him in those specific areas would have to be SL22.   
  
The Deprived also have a comparatively tough early game with many competing priorities for their skill points. The inability to use most early game weapons particularly can present a problem for newer players, as even regular hollows can present a challenge when you have so low endurance and deal so little damage. Once the character gets over the hump however they can be some of the best characters as the player can change their style to suit their immediate needs or to make use of any particularly powerful weapons they find without penalty.   
  
This character, while 'unclothed' actually starts with the [I](/Imported+Set "Dark Souls 2 Imported Set")[mported Set](/Imported+Set "Dark Souls 2 Imported Set") within the inventory. This allows you a small measure of defense until you can find better armor. The [D](/Dagger "Dark Souls 2 Dagger")[agger](/Dagger "Dark Souls 2 Dagger") is the first weapon that you will be able to come across at the start of the game that you can use with the low starting stats of this character. You are also able to use either the [Infantry Axe](/Infantry+Axe "Dark Souls 2 Infantry Axe") or the [Hand Axe](/Hand+Axe "Dark Souls 2 Hand Axe") in two hands without having to upgrade your stats, useful if you're trying to complete the game at SL1 or you want to focus on other stats first.
