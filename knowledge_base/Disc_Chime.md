### How to get Disc Chime in Dark Souls 2

  * [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints "Dark Souls 2 Grave of Saints"): After the [Royal Rat Vanguard](/Royal+Rat+Vanguard "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Vanguard") boss fight, past the [Rat King](/Rat+King "Dark Souls 2 Rat King"), drop down using the sticking-out coffins to a stone "bridge"; you'll spot the treasure at the edge of the room, to the left of a chest. To reach it, you must jump off of the stone bridge onto a small ledge. Try using a plunging attack if you find yourself rolling off the edge. Be sure to equip [Fall Control](/Fall+Control "Dark Souls 2 Fall Control") or the [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring"), as you may incur significant fall damage.

### DS2 Disc Chime Hints and Tips

  * Can block using the regular attack button (only chime that acts as a shield/catalyst); use miracles/hexes with the strong attack button.
  * This chime has an additional secret effect - it adds a flat buff of approximately 30 points of damage when held in the off hand and casting with another chime (tested with dragon chime +10, needs additional testing)
  * Can be handy for faith/hex builds as this chime requires no strength or dexterity to use as a shield, and allows the user to cast miracles without having to switch to a dedicated chime.
  * Due to it's E rating in Dark, this chime has significantly more potential when being used with miracles.
  * Upgraded with standard titanite.
  * When infused with Lightning, this chime can almost completely negate lightning damage when used as a shield.
  * If used as a two-handed weapon it does a surprising amount of damage.
  * At 50 Faith, this chime has a lightning damage bonus of 349.
