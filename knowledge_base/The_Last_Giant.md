### The Last Giant Information in Dark Souls 2

_Apparently, the trees in the Forest of Fallen Giants are the remains of the Giants from long ago. Is this really the last of them?_

  * If you spoke to Pate and received the [White Sign Soapstone](/White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 White Sign Soapstone"), his summon sign will show up at the fog gate leading to the Last Giant.
  * (SotFS) [Sellsword Luet](/Sellsword+Luet "Dark Souls 2 Sellsword Luet")'s small sign is located at the fog gate leading to the Last Giant, allowing his summoning as a shade for the fight.
  * Though the Last Giant is commonly one of the first bosses a player will face, it is not actually necessary to defeat it until around the end of the game, due to requiring the key it drops to move on.

### Dark Souls 2 The Last Giant Location

  * Right next to the ladder that leads downwards from the cardinal tower bonfire is a locked door that can be opened from the other side (you reach it by simply going through the area). Behind that door is an elevator that leads further down, from the bottom you simply follow the hallway to the fog gate.

### The Last Giant Attacks
    
    
    |  | Description | Counter Measures |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Foot Stomp | When near his ankle, lifts up his foot and attempts to stomp the player. This has a slightly larger hit area than perceived and will knock the player flat onto the ground and deal heavy damage if it connects. | - Attacking the ankles has a high chance of provoking this attack, but it's easy to see the attack coming. Just make sure to save some stamina so you can roll away to avoid being crushed. -At low Adaptability, move back and then roll to avoid the shockwave / -This attack has a long recovery, but don’t attack instantly, as it may begin its combo and instantly kill you. |
    | Stomp Tantrum | The Giant will make three foot stomps in succession, alternating his feet between them. Gives the player ample time to attack one of his feet right after he makes the second stomp of the three. | - Save slightly more than one roll’s worth of stamina so that you can avoid the second stomp when the combo starts. You should be far enough after the second stomp to be safe. Assuming you successfully dodge the first one, you can just stay back and wait for the tantrum to end.Or, after the second of the three stomps, run in and start hacking on the foot that's "done." |
    | Arm Detach | After losing exactly half his health, the Giant will stop to tear his left arm off and wield it as a club. He is stationary and vulnerable while doing so. | - If you do enough damage to it, you are able to cut off his left arm before it is torn off preventing him from using it as a weapon. - You must damage his arm for  roughly 40% of his health to cut it off. |
    | Arm Sweep | Sweeps either arm in a semi-circle directly in front of himself. Wielding his arm as a club will extend the reach of this attack. | - Easy to avoid at close range by running between his feet. |
    | Overhand Club | After detaching his arm, the Giant will be able to vertically smash the player with it. | - Telegraphed by the giant raising its arm, usually out of the screen / - Sprint betwixt its legs or dodge sideways. |
    | Backstep | The Giant will slowly jump backward and away if the player attacks its ankles for too long. | -Does not seem to do damage |
    | Body Slam | Sometimes the Giant will stop and fall forward in an attempt to crush the player. / This deals massive damage, but dodging it gives the player an opportunity to attack the Giant's vulnerable head. | - During this move, he will literally fall on his face trying to crush you and then will stay stunned and immobile on the ground more than enough time to land plenty of hits on him. |

###  Strategy

The Last Giant is an ancient and formidable early-game boss. The arena is somewhat cramped, and the boss will pursue the player with moderate speed, utilizing a backstep to create spacing if its ankles are attacked up close. Both its legs and torso can be targeted.

The key to this encounter is staying out of reach of its arm sweeps when using Magic or Ranged attacks. When engaging in melee, focus on avoiding the foot stomp while conserving Stamina for dodging. The foot stomps are particularly powerful and can lead to a quick death for characters with low HP.

When the Giant reaches 50% remaining HP, it removes its left arm to increase the reach of its sweeps. Be wary of his Body Slam; though rare, this move deals massive damage and can easily end the fight if your HP is low.

This encounter can be simplified by using the [Fire Longsword](/Fire+Longsword "Dark Souls 2 Fire Longsword") or [Gold Pine Resin](/Gold+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Gold Pine Resin"), as the boss has mediocre resistance to both Fire and Lightning. By staying near the ankles and rolling away when the Giant prepares to stomp, the fight can be finished quickly.

##  NPC Summons

  * [Mild-mannered Pate:](/Mild+Mannered+Pate "Dark Souls 2 Mild Mannered Pate") His summon sign is located to the right of the boss fog gate. Can be summoned for this fight if the player is in Human Form, and has cleared the area he sits outside and exhausted his dialogue in the Forest of Fallen Giants (and thus received the [White Sign Soapstone](/White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 White Sign Soapstone")). Summoning Pate can reduce the difficulty significantly. Pate will be able to occupy the Last Giant for much of the fight and soak up a large amount of damage.
  * [Sellsword Luet](/Sellsword+Luet "Dark Souls 2 Sellsword Luet") **(Scholar of the First Sin)** : Located in the corner of the final hallway leading to the boss. Luet wields two Greatshields and serves as a dedicated distraction, providing decent damage as well.

###  Video Strategies

###  Hints

  * The Giant has a significant blind spot directly between and behind its legs. While this protects the player from sweep attacks, stay alert for the stomps' impact.
  * It is possible to sever the Giant's left arm prematurely by focusing damage on it, preventing him from gaining attack range at 50%~ HP. However, the arm is difficult to target consistently, making this a high-risk strategy compared to simply focusing on the legs.
  * Weapons with high [Counter Damage](/Counter+Damage "Dark Souls 2 Counter Damage")—such as the [Grand Lance](/Grand+Lance "Dark Souls 2 Grand Lance"), [Winged Spear](/Winged+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Winged Spear"), or [Rapier](/Rapier "Dark Souls 2 Rapier")—are highly effective due to the Giant’s long recovery animations provinding ample windows for landing counter-hits.
