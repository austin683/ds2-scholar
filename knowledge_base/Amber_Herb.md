**Amber Herb** is a type of healing consumable in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Amber Herb** , a perennial herb with a rich amber hue, evoking the illusion of radiance. Replenishes a modest number of uses. Contrary to popular misconception, this herb does indeed bear small white flowers, particularly during the evening hours when the moon graces the sky. [Consumable Items](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") grant various effects such as restorative properties for recovering HP, removing certain negative status effects, applying temporary buffs and debuffs, as well as activating various actions and effects.

> An annual herb with an amber color so deep, it gives the impression of luminescence. Restores a small number of uses. It is the mistaken belief of many that the flowers of this herb do not blossom. However, small white flowers do blossom during dusk when the moon is visible.
