## Walkthrough

From the **Abandoned Dwelling bonfire** go outside and up the snowy ramp on the left and up the stairs at the end. Go through the doorway on the left at the end of the walkway (You will now be at the short bridge with a [Rampart Golem](/Rampart+Golem "Dark Souls 2 Rampart Golem") and the lever that opened the metal door was). Turn right, passing the circular room and go up the spiral stairs. If this is the first time you pass through this area after melting the ice you can enter the door before the spiral stairs to a circular room. There is a [Rampart Soldier](/Rampart+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Rampart Soldier") in here with several chests that can now be looted. Watch out as one of them is a Mimic!

At the top of the spiral stairs there are three paths to take. This first is to the left, the one you took the first time you went through this area. The second is to the right and have two enemies stading by ballistas and a Pharros Contraption at the end. The third is straight ahead, take that one to get to the Knight. Go down the stairs and kill the Lancer. Exit the building, turn left and go down the stairs. Watch out since the two Rampart Soldier across the courtyard might be shooting at you.

Enter the building, you will now be in a long hallway with wooden floors that have a lot of holes. There will be two Rampart Soldier and a [Rampart Spearman](/Rampart+Spearman "Dark Souls 2 Rampart Spearman") in the hallway plus a third Rampart Soldier on the second balcony on the right(He can be sniped from the first balcony, which you can get to by simply running across the hallway when you enter. At the end of the hallway you will be in a small room with two ladders, one going down and one going up. Going up the ladder leads to a small room with a door you can open for a shortcut (the door at the small bridge that is just before the circular room with the chests and the spiral staircase).

From the shortcut-door go down the ladder and down the next one as well. A Rampart Spearman will be waiting at the bottom. From where the Spearman was standing you can snipe a Rampart Soldier that is standing on the wooden floor in the hallway on the level below. Continue down the next ladder where a Rampart Golem will be waiting. Go down the hallway, to the left is a balcony with a corpse holding [Ring Of Resistance](/Ring+Of+Resistance "Dark Souls 2 Ring Of Resistance") +1 and to the right is a ladder leading down to the ground floor of the building. Four [Rampart Stray Dog](/Rampart+Stray+Dog "Dark Souls 2 Rampart Stray Dog") will come running to attack you just as you step off the ladder. Be careful not to run too much around in the hallway when fighting the dogs as three more dogs lie in wait in the opposite end of the hallway(the end where you originally entered the building). The small room where the dogs came from have a chest with some loot. Run to the end of the hallway(opposite end of the small room with the chest) and dispatch the three dogs. Go through the winding hallway that leads back outside.

Follow the walkway past the building with the elevator(this leads back after you have freed the Loyce Knight). Before the end of the walkway you will be invaded by [Castaway Witch Donna](/Castaway+Witch+Donna "Dark Souls 2 Castaway Witch Donna"). Kill her and dispatch the Rampart Golem that waits at the end. Open the door and you will have freed one of the Loyce Knights.
