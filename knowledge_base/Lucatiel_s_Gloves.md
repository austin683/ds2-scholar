"_Worn by knights while on travel. Belonged to Lucatiel of Mirrah. Only those who have distinguished themselves on the battlefield were admitted into the elite ranks of Mirrah's official order of knights. It is common to hear of a peasant's dream of striving for knighthood as an escape from hardship, but who would ever think it possible?_ "

  * Will also be given to you by talking to her after summoning her to three bosses where she survives the encounter.
