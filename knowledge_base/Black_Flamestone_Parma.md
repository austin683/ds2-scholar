**Black Flamestone Parma** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A small shield affixed with a black crystal. Found deep inside the Gutter, in the Black Gulch.  
Heavier than a standard small shield but the hard crystal boosts its defense against slashing._

     _Some of the more determined souls exiled to the Gutter sought to scale the walls of the forsaken place  
and walk the earth once again, but failed, and wasted away mired in misery and resentment."_
