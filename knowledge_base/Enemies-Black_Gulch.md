## Black Gulch Enemies

  

  

###  [Cragslipper](/Cragslipper) (Razorback Nightcrawler)

  

_This giant millipede is found only in Black Gulch. In contrast to the artificial creatures roaming The Gutter, the Razorback Nightcrawler is a product of an undisturbed evolution. They are more capable of crushing a careless passerby with their great weight and tremendous power_   
Enormous, many-eyed worm monsters that crawl from their hole-lairs in the walls of Black Gulch. Because they cannot completely leave their lairs, they are unable to chase the player and have a limited attack range. They can safely be hit with ranged attacks, but have high health. 

  

  

###  [Darksucker](/Darksucker) (Coal Tar)

  

Black, many-tentacled monsters that, when a player approaches, will burst out from the black tar pools on the floor of Black Gulch and will eat the player if he stands in one spot for too long. To deal with them easily, use pyromancy or a fire arrow from afar to light their pools on fire. This will quickly burn the creatures to death without them leaving their hole at all. 

  

  

###  [Great Giant Warrior](/Great+Giant+Warrior) (Elite Giant)

  

True, gargantuan giants with holes for faces, they will hit extremely hard with the huge mace-like weapons they carry. Fought as a pair.its attacks are unblock able and will go straight through your shield.   
Im not so sure how much health it has, but it is around 2000-3000, its attacks do 500-900. my tip is to stay right behind its legs and attack only once every now and then. sometimes it may hit you with one attack how it plunges both its weapons back and it can hit you if not careful. its mostly weak as hell if it cant hit you id also recommend wearing vengals armour for fights with this creature if there are two or one other giants try to lure the weaker one away. 

  

  

###  [Woodland Child Gully](/Woodland+Child+Gully)

  

A Red Spirit found in the Black Gulch. 

  

  

###  [Woodland Child Victor](/Woodland+Child+Victor)

  

A Red Spirit found in the Black Gulch. 

  

  

###  [Forlorn](/Forlorn)

  

_Born of Aldia's Obsession with the First Sin, the Forlorn lost both their corporeal form and a world to call their own. Now they drift into other worlds, ever in search of a home. But without self, one has neither beginning nor end, and so the Forlorn have only to wander._
