**Daggers** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a type of [Weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") that are lightweight, small, and best used at short-ranged combat. They make up for the short range with fast attack speed and high Critical Damage which allows them to do devastating Backstabs and Ripostes. When Daggers are buffed with a status effect, it can help deal massive damage in a short time with the help of its fast attacks. Daggers are set back with their short-range capabilities, as it will often require the player to get up close to an opponent to inflict damage, they also lack the ability to trade with heavier weapons like Greatswords because of their low poise. These weapon can be effective in combats where the player prefers a stealth approach, and when confronted, it is easier to dodge as the weapon is lightweight. This page covers a list of all Daggers in Dark Souls 2.
