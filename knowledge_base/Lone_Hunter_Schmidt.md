### Lone Hunter Schmidt Information in Dark Souls 2

  * He wields a [Composite Bow](/Composite+Bow "Dark Souls 2 Composite Bow") and a [Small Leather Shield](/Small+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Small Leather Shield")
  * He wears the [Wanderer's Set](/Wanderer+Set "Dark Souls 2 Wanderer Set") without the hood
  * He fires Iron Arrows (that inflicts disappointingly little damage) and (obviously) never blocks with his shield, since he does not have a melee weapon of any sort as a close-quarters option
  * His shots have longer range than expected, which probably means that he also wears the Hawk Ring
  * He can surprisingly make headshots, especially against invading players
