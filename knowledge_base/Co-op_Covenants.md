## Co-op Covenants

These are the covenants which seek to lend assistance to other players through the use of the [White Sign Soapstone](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/White+Sign+Soapstone), or through special abilities that assist their allies in cooperative player-versus-environment play. Note that while these covenants may be co-op _flavored,_ there are still ways for members of these covenants to invade and kill other players, and even something as seemingly innocuous as a group healing spell can be a dangerous weapon in the hands of a savvy invader.

These players will focus on co-operative play and assistance, and strike a special pose while being summoned. Additionally, their golden signs are expected to be more noticeable and thus be able to assist others more often. Sunlight warriors gain sunlight medals upon helping a host in their world which they can use to rank up in the covenant.

Heirs of the Sun does not have any multiplayer items exclusive to the covenant.

### [Way of the Blue](/Way+of+the+Blue)

[  
](/Way+of+the+Blue)[   
](/Way+of+the+Blue)While traveling the kingdom of Drangleic, dark spirits may invade your world. If you're a member of the Way of Blue, you'll receive assistance from the [Blue Sentinels](/Blue+Sentinels "Blue Sentinels"). Sentinels are automatically summoned to the world of another player who has been invaded to defend the host. Only invaders who used a [Cracked Red Eye Orb](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb) will trigger this effect, and a Way of the Blue member will not receive assistance if invaded by a [Grey Spirit](/Bell+Keepers), [Dragon Spirit](/Dragon+Remnants), or if they summoned a player from a [Red Sign](/Red+Sign+Soapstone).

  * #### Covenant Items

Way of the Blue does not have any exclusive multiplayer items. A [Blue Sentinel](/Blue+Sentinels) will automatically be summoned to assist an invaded Way of the Blue member, provided the [Blue Sentinel](/Blue+Sentinels) is wearing their [Guardian's Seal](/Guardian%27s+Seal). The Way of the Blue player does not need to wear their [Blue Seal](/Blue+Seal) for this to occur.
