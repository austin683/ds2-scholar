### Mad Warrior Gauntlets Description

_"King Vendrick called upon powers from beyond his borders in an attempt to stave off the curse. Perhaps they belonged to one of his guests."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Dropped by [a Black Phantom NPC](/Mad+Warrior) in [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol). (Any difficulty)

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite.](/Twinkling+Titanite)
  * You will have to join the [Bell Keepers](/Bell+Keeper) covenant and kill the [Mad Warrior](/Mad+Warrior) numerous times in order to obtain this set and his [blade](/Berserker+Blade). See the [phantom](/Mad+Warrior) specific page for more detail.
  * The head has a striking resemblance to a predator's mask in the series Predators. Taking "out of border" into account, this might be a reference.
