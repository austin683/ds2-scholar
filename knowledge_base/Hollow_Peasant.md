### Dark Souls 2 Hollow Peasant Information

Former working-class residents of Brightstone Cove Tseldora. The mysterious events surrounding the town`s destruction robbed these unfortunate souls of their humanity and reduced them to cursed monsters; they now viciously attack any who wander into the settlement`s remains. Their weapons may be just farming equipment, but are enchanted with Dark and cause curse, along with doing a large amount of damage. This, coupled with their large numbers, makes them surprisingly dangerous.
