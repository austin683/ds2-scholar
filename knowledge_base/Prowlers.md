#  Prowlers

The Prowlers are an invading phantom group in the [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King) DLC.   
They wear the [Mad Warrior Set](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Mad+Warrior+Set) and carry the [Berserker Blade](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Berserker+Blade) and also longbow.   
  

###  Location:

  * The first one spawns just in the middle of the room with the [Ashen Idol](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Ashen+Idol) and the rest of them will spawn on the stairs towards the Eygil statue.

  

###  Note:

The Ashen Idol is able to restore the Prowlers Health so it's recommended to get rid of her before going up the stairs.   
They are also able to restore health by using Estus Flasks.   
They CAN be farmed through burning Bonfire Ascetic at Foyer Bonfire, traveling to Upper Floor Bonfire, facing them and repeating the process.
