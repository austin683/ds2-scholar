Barbed Club **is a hammer obtained by trading a [Flexile Sentry Soul](/Flexile+Sentry+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry Soul") and 1500 souls with Straid of Olaphis. It can be upgraded to +5 with Petrified Dragon Bone but can't be infused with Bleed. In PvP, it's great for countering roll backstabs with its one-handed strong attack that can be aimed freely.

### How to get Barbed Club in Dark Souls 2

### DS2 Barbed Club Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5. Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * Prior to Calibration 1.09, this weapon, when infused, didn't seem to lose physical damage and instead gains some bonuses to it as well as its bleed. However this is no longer the case.
  * This hammer, and small hammers in general, are fantastic offhand in pvp when paired with a slower weapon with good reach.
  * Many players will attempt to roll backstab your spear/lance/halberd/greathammer/ultragreatsword/ect, but small hammer 1 handed strong attacks can be free aimed swiftly in any direction when lock on is disengaged and can be used to punish the roll bs attempt with a 180 degree turn and a one handed R2, R2 combo. Using small hammers in this way can dissuade roll backstab attempts and boost the viability of slower, roll bs prone weapons.
