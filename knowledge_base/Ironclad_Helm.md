_"Helm worn by Ironclad Soldiers. Provides high defense, but is so heavy that it requires great strength to move"_

_"The Ironclad Soldiers were minions created by the Old Iron King, their life granted by an enchantment of souls. By now this is again an iron husk, and fit to wear."_

### Location

  * Drops off of Ironclad Soldiers in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep")

### Notes

  * Part of the [Ironclad Set](/Ironclad+Set "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Set"). 
    * Since the developers of Dark Souls love the Berserk series so much they often sneak in equipment that looks like equipment used in the Manga. This set of armour looks like bazuso's from Berserk. (Example)- 
    * Set requires 14 [Strength](/Strength "Dark Souls 2 Strength") to equip.
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Ores "Dark Souls 2 Ores").
  * Blocks bonus damage and stagger from headshots.
