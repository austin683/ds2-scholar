**Gyrm Axe** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Grym Axe** is a big and strong axe that hits hard. Good for those who want a simple but powerful weapon. It's all about physical damage and works well for strong characters who like to deal heavy blows.

> An axe used by the nomadic Gyrm.

>  At first glance this axe appears crude, but with further examination one sees the fine craftsmanship of Gyrm blacksmiths. Quite heavy for a human, but flung about with reckless abandon by the Gyrm. 

### How to get Gyrm Axe in Dark Souls 2

  * [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros") Treasure: Found on a corpse in the left side of the staircase in the first area.
  * Dropped by [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior") enemies in the [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros") area.

### DS2 Grym Axe Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * This axe attacks differently than other axes. While most axes attack with sideways strikes, the Gyrm is swung from over the shoulder as part of a tackle, slamming the axe into the ground. The strong attack is a big overhand swing as normal.
  * This axe acts as like a Greataxe rather than normal axe. When powerstanced it applies a powerstanced greataxe moveset.
  * As the weapon's description hints, players should treat this axe as though they were wielding a Great weapon. Like most Great weapons, the axe has the tendency to swing where the character is facing at that moment, which could miss the enemy despite having lock-on.
