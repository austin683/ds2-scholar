### Dark Souls 2 Trophy & Achievement Tips
    
    
    | Name | PS3 | Xbox 360 | Basic Description | Detailed Description |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | This is Dark Souls | Bronze | 10G | Die for the first time | Rest assured, you'll get this Achievement/Trophy hundreds of times in the course of a normal playthrough! Try to die near a Bonfire if you are just trying to get the Achievement/Trophy so you can quickly retrieve your Souls. |
    | Selfless Giver | Gold | 50G | Max-out devotion to covenant . | I know this is easy if you are playing online but it is also possible to obtain this if you are playing offline, Either by the covenant / Way of the Blue / / or / Pilgrims of Dark / / . You can join Way of the Blue very early in game and max ranking up in this covenant is possible by killing 10 scripted NPC invader. There's more scripted NPC invade in the game. For Pilgrims of Dark is much easier. Just finish the 3 extra stages and beat the boss Darklurker . Then you talk again to the covenant master it will max out. Thus obtaining this trophy. |
    | Smith for Life | Silver | 30G | Inherit Steady Hand McDuff 's equipment | After finding the Dull Ember in the Iron Keep, give it to Steady Hand McDuff in the Lost Bastille to gain access to his shop menu. Once you've spent a total of at least 14,000 Souls for his various services (Edit: 'Various services' is incorrect. It was only after I infused with him using at least 12,000 Souls that he provided the item and achievement.), select the talk option in his menu. He will give you an item as thanks and you will unlock the Achievement/Trophy. / SoFtS- Same as listed above but Dull Ember can now be found in a chest at the 5th listed bonfire in the Lost Bastille , you will need to defeat the Pursuer in Forest of Fallen Giants and examine the bird's nest after the fight. |
    | Garrulous Miser | Silver | 30G | Inherit Laddersmith Gilligan 's equipment | After you've met Laddersmith Gilligan at Earthen Peak and spoken to him so he moves to Majula, visit him there. Pay him to set his most expensive ladder down. Once you've done this, select the talk option from his menu to receive a reward and unlock the Achievement/Trophy. In addition if you did not talk to him during your playthrough, he will appear in Majula after you defeat the final boss at which point you can also pay for his largest ladder earning the trophy. |
    | Change of Clothes | Silver | 30G | Give Rosabeth of Melfia something to wear | After you've un-petrified Rosabeth of Melfia near the door at the entrance to the Shaded Woods, speak to her again. Eventually, she will ask a favor; a donation of clothes. Give her some of your old equipment that you don't need any more and you'll unlock this Achievement/Trophy after you do. |
    | Gathering of Exiles | Silver | 30G | Increase the population of Majula | As you progress through the game, you'll meet numerous friendly characters on the way that will eventually move to Majula to offer their services to you, if you meet certain conditions. Find and exhaust dialogue with the following NPCs to get the trophy: / Merchant Hag Melentia / Meet her at the Cardinal bonfire in Forest of Fallen Giants . Cale the Cartographer / Also in the Forest of Fallen Giants , in a cave accessible via scaffolding after descending a ladder from the Cardinal bonfire. Carhillion of the Fold / In a platform right before the boss of No Man's Wharf . You must have at least 8 intelligence to talk to him! Licia of Lindeldt / Above Dragonrider's boss room, in Heide's Tower of Flame . Rosabeth of Melfia / She is petrified before the Shaded Woods .area can be accessed. Use a fragrant branch of yore . Laddersmith Gilligan / Can be found at Earthen Peak, past a wood gate near the windmill. Even if you miss him, he will come after the Old Iron King is defeated. Stone Trader Chloanne / After the Skeleton Lords you will reach Harvest Valley and can talk to her near the first bonfire. |
    | Reflections on Disembodiment | Silver | 30G | Inherit equipment from the Head of Vengarl | Once you've found the Head of Vengarl in a clearing in the Shaded Woods, exhaust all of his dialogue options. Once you get access to his menu, be sure to learn his Gesture, but also keep selecting the talk option. Do it repeatedly until he thanks you for your time and give you Vengarl's Helm, which will also unlock this Achievement/Trophy. |
    | Curious Map | Silver | 30G | Light all flames on the map in Majula | In the mansion in Majula, there is a certain map. Once you have met Cartographer Cale in the Forest of Fallen Giants and have acquired the House Key from him, enter the mansion and head to the basement. There, you'll find the map. When you first go to it, if you haven't defeated any bosses, you won't see anything special. However, as you complete certain key events in the game and light certain Bonfires, a corresponding fire will appear on the map. / In order to unlock the Achievement/Trophy, you'll have to complete the 8 events listed in the table below this one, as well as light the correct Bonfire related to that event. Once you have, speak to Cartographer Cale in the basement next to the map. Go through his dialogue repeatedly until he gives you his equipment, which will unlock the Achievement/Trophy. |
    | Vendrick | Silver | 50G | Defeat Vendrick | Deep in the Undead Crypt lies the former king Vendrick. While you don't need to defeat him to proceed with the game, you will need to for this Achievement/Trophy. He is a deadly foe, but the battle will go much easier if you first retrieve the Soul of a Giant items. For each one you retrieve from the different Memories you can access, Vendrick's defense will lower. Since you need the Ashen Mist Heart item to access Memories, it is recommended that you don't attempt this until just before the end of the game. |
    | Lucatiel | Silver | 30G | Inherit equipment Lucatiel of Mirrah | You will encounter Lucatiel of Mirrah in numerous locations throughout Drangleic. In order to get her to bestow her equipment upon you, you will have to meet her in each of these locations and activate each of her Summon Signs, ensuring she does not die and defeating a boss while doing so. You must also ensure you defeat these bosses with her before exhausting her storyline, which ends at Aldia's Keep. Bonfire ascetics can be used to respawn these bosses if you defeated them without Lucatiel, but they cannot be used to "reset" her storyline. The four bosses that Lucatiel can be summoned for are: / Flexile Sentry in No Man's Wharf / First, speak with her near the entrance bonfire. Find her summon sign in the house that has the shortcut between the ship area and the start. Smelter Demon in Iron Keep / To trigger her here you must first do Earthen Peak and speak to her at the Lower Earthen Peak bonfire. Her summon sign then appears right after the drawbridge near the Smelter Demon fog. The Rotten in Black Gulch / Near the first bonfire of the Black Gulch, there's a drop-down area with a cave. Talk to her here and her summon sign will be available by the second bonfire. Lost Sinner in Sinner's Rise / You will have to talk to her in a circular room in the Lost Bastille right after McDuffs Bonfire. Once you make her to The Saltfort bonfire, you'll find her sign at the bottom of the elevator. / Only three of these four bosses are required for the achievement/trophy. |
    | Holder of the Fort | Silver | 30G | Inherit Captain Drummond 's equipment | You'll find Captain Drummond in the Memory of Vammar , which can be accessed via the withered tree in courtyard area of the Forest of Fallen Giants after you have the ashen Mist Heart. Go through all his dialogue options, then head to the Memory of Jeigh and take on the Giant Lord. After defeating the Giant Lord (you do not have to summon Drummond before the battle if you don't wish), go back into the Memory of Vammar. Speak to him again and he will give you a Drangleic Helm, which will also unlock the Achievement/Trophy. |
    | Moonlight Greatsword | Silver | 30G | Inherit Benhart of Jugo 's equipment | You will encounter Benhart of Jugo, first in Majula, just before the entrance to the Shaded Woods. After freeing Rosabeth of Melfia, speak to him again. You will then encounter him and his Summon Sign in numerous other locations; if you summon him and defeat three bosses while he is with you without him dying, he will bestow his equipment upon you the next time you speak to him. He is available for the Prowling Magus battle, Looking Glass Knight battle, Giant Lord battle, and finally you receive his equipment from him in the Memory of Orro. Reccomendation for quick farming of 3 Fights is to reset the Last Giant bonfire. Ensure you have talked to him in Memory of Orro before heading in, allows for relatively easy/effecient soul farm + achievement. / He's available for the Throne Watcher and Throne Defender fight, however this DOES NOT count towards the 3 fights needed. The Nashandra fight does.  Either die to Nashandra or leave arena and summon if you intend on using this fight for the achievement as getting him to survive the duo fight before hand will likely not allow him to survive the following fight. |
    | The Dark Soul | Platinum | 50G | Acquire all Trophies/Earn all Achievements | Completing the arduous, painstaking task of acquiring every other Achievement/Trophy will endow you with two things; this final Achievement/Trophy, and a profound sense of accomplishment. Well done! |
