**Pyromancies** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** is a type of [Magic](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic") that deals fire elemental damage with its offensive spells. Most of the Pyromancy spells are offensive-focused and best used at short to medium range.

### What are Pyromancies in Dark Souls 2

**Pyromancies** are fire spells used offensively that do not require any Faith or Intelligence and can be cast with the use of the Pyromancy Flame or Dark Pyromancy Flame. Since the damage of these spells are fire-based, any opponent resistant to fire damage will not be affected by any Pyromancy spells.

Pyromancy spells are favored by those players who go for physical damage builds but still wants to use magic to surprise opponents and fill the gap from mid to long range combat. One of the drawbacks of Pyromancies is that most of its spells have short range and a long casting time, along with its small number of uses. Pyromancy spells do have high damage output to compensate for its drawbacks.
