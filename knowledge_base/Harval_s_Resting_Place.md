#  Harval's Resting Place

* * *

##  Location:

Pay Gilligan in Majula 3500 souls for a ladder to reach this easily. Otherwise, parkour to the first lighted doorway in the pit in Majula. The lower doorway will take you to the Gutter/Black Gulch.

Go down the ladder, right across you should be able to jump to a wooden platform, and then jump down to the doorway. 

The black metal ladder that leads back upwards after you go down the 3500 souls ladder will require the Forgotten Key to enter, which you can find in a pit in Black Gulch, this door has 3 chests inside.

Once past the bonfire, you'll find an unkillable undead(he's a pal), and a circular fountain type structure, you cannot reach the item inside it until you make your way around by killing the Royal Rat Vanguard boss. Continue forward and to the left, you'll find a Smooth and Silky Stone, which can be used on the invisible birds nest just past the Things Betwixt bonfire to receive a random item.

The only Pharros Lockstone that's worth it to use in this area is on the bridge, just after you leave the tunnel from the bonfire. It will be on the ground right in front of you, and will give you Poison Moss x2, the spell Whisper of Despair, and a torch. Moving ahead, you'll see the path blocked by another raised bridge. Turn back, go up the ladder by the rats in the wall, and you'll see another bridge to drop and another Pharros Lockstone in the floor. If you choose to use it, you'll get nothing more than another way to traverse the area, which could be useful depending on how confident you are fighting Rhoy the Explorer. 

Turning to your right once up the ladder will take you to the next bonfire: Grave Entrance, and the Royal Rat Vanguard boss fight.

Use Ascetic at the first bonfire, Harval's Resting Place to respawn Rhoy the Explorer to farm him for Awestones for leveling up in the Company of Champions covenant. Note: Rhoy respawns near the second bonfire, so after burning ascetic here, travel to the second bonfire, drop down the stairs and climb back up for Rhoy

##  Bosses:

  * Later in the area you'll find the Royal Rat Vanguard boss, a mob boss consisting of a bunch of rats and their king
  * The rats will all apply Petrify with their attacks which is an instant kill if it gets applied to your character. Best strategy in this fight is as much area of attack as you can manage, to keep most of the rats off of you, and focus on the one with the mohawk. He's the one you need to kill. The rest will just continue being summoned.
