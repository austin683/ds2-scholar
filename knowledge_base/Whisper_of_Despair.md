**Whisper of Despair** is a Hex in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Hex, you must use a staff/chime or Special Weapons that can cast Hex.

> "A hex that releases verbose darkness.  
> The darkness echoes words of despair, reducing the defense of opponents.  
>   
> The Dark blankets the world in black.  
> A thing of tranquility, a thing serene.  
>   
> Catalyst: staff"

### Acquired From

  * Grave of Saints. When you reach the "Harval's Resting Place" bonfire, proceed straight. Upon entering the circular room, proceed to the next lit doorway and follow the path. Look for the Pharros' Lockstone mechanism directly across from a drawbridge. Use a Pharros' Lockstone to activate it, drop the bridge, and then proceed up the ramp that follows. The hex will be on a body at the top of the rampway.

### Whisper of Despair Notes

  * A particularly useful hex against enemy invaders and foes wearing heavy armor. especially against full Havel's Armor in PvP.
  * The defense reduction effect does not stack with each hit. Subsequent casts reapply the [debuff](/Buffs+&+Debuffs "Dark Souls 2 Buffs & Debuffs").
  * The effect lasts for 60 seconds.
  * The defense drop only affects physical damage. 
    * (Tested on Ironclad Knights in FoFG using consumables and other spells)
  * The incantation sound effect is shared by [Aldia Warlock](/Aldia+Warlock "Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock").
  * Recommended to cast [Recollection](/Recollection "Dark Souls 2 Recollection") before casting this spell so it can be easier to land the debuff.  
Very useful against bosses, particularly on NG+ playthroughs.
  * Decreases physical defense by 200 points (this can increase physical damage by 70-90 on most bosses which is a must have spell for max damage melee builds)
