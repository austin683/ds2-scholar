**Greatshield of Glory** is a [ Greatshield](/Greatshields "Dark Souls 2 Greatshields") in Dark Souls 2. **Greatshields** can be used not only to block an enemy but allows player to do **shield bash**(Great shields replaced parry ability with heavy shield bash).

     _"Greatshield of the King's loyal knight Syan._

     _The King commissioned this greatshield specifically for his loyal knight, but Syan met his demise before its completion."_

### Acquired From:

  * Dropped from [Drakekeepers](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper") (with a warpick) in [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Shrine") (rare drop).

### Greatshield of Glory Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Drop rate is fairly low, recommended using the [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring") and [Jester's Cap](/Jester's+Cap "Dark Souls 2 Jester's Cap")/[Prisoner's Set](/Prisoner's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner's Set") in tandem.
  * This shield has very good elemental defenses, especially against fire. If infused with Fire it will have 97.5% resistance to fire damage. The [Gyrm Greatshield](/Gyrm+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Greatshield") has 100% resistance to both fire and physical damage by default, however, making it a better option if one seeks only to hinder the effects of those two elements specifically.
  * A commonly held belief is that the item descriptions of this shield and the [Tower Shield](/Tower+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Tower Shield") were erroneously flipped, as this shield has nothing to do with the Royal Syan knights.
  * Resembles the [Tower Shield](https://demonssouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Tower+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Tower Shield") from _Demon's Souls_.
  * This greatshield reappears in the sequel  _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Greatshield of Glory](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Greatshield+of+Glory "Dark Souls 2 Greatshield of Glory").
