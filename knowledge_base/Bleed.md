**Bleed** is a [Status Effect](/Status+Effects "Dark Souls 2 Status Effects") in **Dark Souls 2**. It deals additional damage to those afflicted by it once it is procced. It will also reduce the maximum [stamina](/Stamina "Dark Souls 2 Stamina") of the target to 75% for up to 5 to 10 seconds. The player has an innate Bleed Resistance stat affected by [Adaptability](/Adaptability "Dark Souls 2 Adaptability") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"), capping at 200 Poison Resist when both stats are 99. Other sources for Bleed Resistance will have to come from spells and equipment, capping at 890 Bleed Resist.

### Dark Souls 2 Bleed Guide

In order to inflict Bleed, the buildup meter must be filled, and once it has the target will take 200 points of damage. It is impossible to increase the total amount of damage Bleed can inflict, only the rate at which Bleed can build up can be increased. The amount of bleed buildup one does with each attack to fill up the buildup meter is affected by the Bleed Attack Bonus stat, which is increased by raising [Dexterity](/Dexterity "Dark Souls 2 Dexterity") and [Faith](/Faith "Dark Souls 2 Faith"). [Shadow Gauntlets](/Shadow+Gauntlets "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Gauntlets") and [Crest of Blood](/Crest+of+Blood "Dark Souls 2 Crest of Blood") increase bleed buildup on weapons that have either innate bleed or are infused with it:  
Weapons with innate Bleed get 50 points of extra buildup.  
Weapons infused with Bleed get 25 points of extra buildup.  
Weapons with innate Bleed and infused with Bleed get 60 points of extra buildup.  
These items stack, so wearing both of them and using a Bleed-infused weapon grants 50 points of extra buildup.
