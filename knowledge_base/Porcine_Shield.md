**Porcine Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A strangely porcine shield._

     _The pig head looks eerily authentic, but it is an imitation.  
Though the shield's defensive capacity is ordinary, it may spook an unsuspecting foe."_

### Acquired From

  * [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") : In a chest in between the [Smelter Demon](/Smelter+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Demon") boss arena and the bonfire just beyond it.

### Porcine Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * The Porcine Peasant in [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora") wields this shield.
  * The slightly heightened fire defense may suggest it's made of leather.
  * This shield reappears in the sequel  _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Porcine Shield](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Porcine+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Porcine Shield").
  * This shield is allegedly a nod to EpicNameBro for his assistance with the Dark Souls 2 guidebook and his Marcus Greatshield submission to the Dark Souls 2 Shield Design Contest held by Bandai Namco and FromSoftware.
