  * Determines how much extra damage you do with fire weapons and pyromancy spells

  * For example, 5 Intelligence and 55 Faith, 30 Intelligence and 30 Faith, and 55 Intelligence and 5 Faith all result in 147 Fire Bonus
  * Start at 50 with 0 Intelligence and Faith
  * Each point of Fire BNS is worth roughly 1.6 damage given S scaling on your flame. The average might be slightly higher or lower with a larger sample size.

Scaling of Fire BNS with Int/Faith:  
Your Fire BNS only goes up with every 2 points total between Int and Faith. The numbers given will be 10 points apart & the bonus per point will be average, Formula is as follows. (FTH+INT)/2.

  * _10 points total_ : 61 Fire BNS; 1.1 average Fire BNS per point.
  * _20 points total_ : 72 Fire BNS; 1.1 average Fire BNS per point; no change in scaling from previous 10 points.
  * _30 points total_ : 94 Fire BNS; 1.47 average Fire BNS per point; 2.2 Fire BNS per point when compared to previous 10 points.
  * _40 points total_ : 117 Fire BNS; 1.68 average Fire BNS per point; 2.3 Fire BNS per point when compared to previous 10 points.
  * _50 points total_ : 132 Fire BNS; 1.64 average Fire BNS per point; 1.5 Fire BNS per point when compared to previous 10 points.
  * _60 points total_ : 147 Fire BNS; 1.62 average Fire BNS per point; no change in scaling from previous 10 points.
  * Now, here's where the scaling drops off hugely, so let's jump forward a bit...
  * _100 points total_ : 162 Fire BNS; 1.12 average Fire BNS per point; 0.38 Fire BNS per point when compared to all previous sets.
  * You will see the largest gains in Fire BNS, and therefore Pyromancy damage, every two points between 20 and 40 total Int/Faith.
  * Past 60 total Int/Faith, scaling drops off massively, making any points past here extremely inefficient.

Pyromancy damage gains are calculated entirely by Fire BNS in relation to your Flame scaling regardless of the spell's base damage. Most efficient Fire BNS gains are between 20 and 40 total Int/Faith, with (by far) the least efficient gains being after 60 total Int/Faith.
