**Lion Warrior Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").  
  
  
_The Lion Clan are an offshoot race that have no ties to humans, and would murder anyone with the curious notion of approaching them._   
_The lion clansmen seem to despise their own looks, as they hate being seen._

### Set Location

  * Cape, cuffs and skirt are dropped by [Lion Clan Warrior](/Lion+Clan+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Lion Clan Warrior") in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") (only found next to Shaded Ruins bonfire).
  * Helm and alternative chestpiece – [Red Lion Warrior Cape](/Red+Lion+Warrior+Cape "Dark Souls 2 Red Lion Warrior Cape") – are dropped by Golden-maned Lion Warrior found below the arena with [Manscorpion Tark](/Manscorpion+Tark "Dark Souls 2 Manscorpion Tark"). That lion spawns only once and both items are rare drops. 
    * [Scholar of the First Sin] That lion is moved to ruins straight on the path from bonfire.

### Lion Warrior Set Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Cuffs offer the highest curse resistance.
  * Skirt offers third highest curse resistance.
  * All pieces of the set reduce falling damage (the effect is weaker compared to [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring")). All pieces stack with each other and with other items having that effect.
  * Their item descriptions differ a lot from the original Japanese text. Rather than saying they 'have no ties to humans', the JP text instead says "they have absolutely no contact with humans, and anyone who approaches them becomes a target for slaughter".
