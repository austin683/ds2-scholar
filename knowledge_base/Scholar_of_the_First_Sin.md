###  Location

  * Originally found in the room of the final primal bonfire to be lit, if all bonfires have been lit prior to downloading [Patch 1.10](/Patch+1.10) he will automatically appear in Black Gulch
  * After exhausting his dialogue he moves to the next location. This is true for all encounters.
  * At [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt): [Undead Crypt Entrance](/Undead+Crypt+Entrance)
  * At [Dragon Shrine](/Dragon+Shrine): [Shrine Entrance](/Shrine+Entrance) Bonfire - (**You do not have to answer 'yes'** to his questions to have access to the alternative ending (The normal ending is still going to be available, but you have to fight him later on))
  * In the [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want) after the [Nashandra](/Nashandra) boss fight - You cannot see him with a character that has defeated her already, unless you use a [Bonfire Ascetic. ](/Bonfire+Ascetic)[Vendrick](/Vendrick) needs to be defeated before fighting Nashandra for the Scholar to appear.

  

###  Events

  * Can be fought as a boss in [Throne of Want](/Throne+of+Want) as [Aldia, scholar of the First Sin](/Aldia%2C+scholar+of+the+First+Sin). If defeated, drops nothing. Unlocks the alternative, "destruction of the order" ending with new end credits music.
  * Can not be summoned

  

###  Dialogue & Lore

  * The Scholar seems to have the same role as Kaathe from Dark Souls and tells the Chosen Undead about how humans are inherently dark (as they inherited the Dark Soul), and how the "transient forms" of humans while the First Flame is lit are an illusion.
  * The Scholar loosely resembles a human head covered with branch from the Bed of Chaos, he's also bound by the Bonfire, and the voice of the [Emerald Herald](/Emerald+Herald) can be heard within his voice loosely.
  * The third time you encounter him, the Scholar reveals himself as Aldia, King Vendrick's brother and former owner of [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep).
  * In the ending credits of the Scholar of the First Sin, there are three voice actors listed for new update: one for [Aldia](/Aldia%2C+scholar+of+the+First+Sin), one for [Vendrick](/Vendrick) and one for [Alsanna](/Alsanna%2C+Silent+Oracle). It is likely that the female voice and possibly two male voices heard in Scholar of the First Sin NPC's dialogue are actually all of the three characters (Citation needed, [Cut parts of the dialogue with the three voices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_eJzbA0FvE))
  * He is primarily voiced by David Gant, the same voice actor of _Oswald of Carim_
