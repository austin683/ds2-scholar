### Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight Information

Giant mastadon-like knights. These heavy armor brutes comes in two variants: the Golden ones in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") and the decayed rusted ones in [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros"). They are all armed with giant Halberds.   
  
_One of the original Primal Knights, this ragged creature went Hollow long ago and now wanders mindlessly with its equipment in tatters from long years of neglect. First created through a dark and forbidden ritual in ages past, the Primal Knights are artificial creatures contrived by a twisted and power-hungry mind. Their susceptibility to the Undead Curse, a trait they share with humans, raises foreboding questions about the rituals through which they were given life..._
