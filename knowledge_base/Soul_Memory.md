**Soul Memory** serves as a pivotal online and gameplay mechanic within [Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"), playing a crucial role in the interconnected world of online multiplayer. This dynamic feature essentially acts as a ledger, meticulously tallying the total number of Souls a player has acquired throughout their journey. The fundamental principle governing Soul Memory is its role in matchmaking. The system ensures that players with comparable Soul Memory are paired together, fostering in theory a balanced and engaging multiplayer experience. In essence, if you've amassed a high Soul Memory, you'll find yourself engaging with other players who share a similar level of accomplishment in their soul-collecting endeavors.

For those seeking multiplayer adventures, having similar**Soul Memory Range** becomes imperative. This means that to partake in cooperative or competitive gameplay with fellow souls, your accumulated Soul Memory must align within a compatible range. 

## Soul Memory Tips in Dark Souls 2

### What is Soul Memory used for in Dark Souls 2?

Soul Memory is the cumulative total of all the souls gathered on a character. In this game, it is part of the formula that sets the minimum and maximum range for interactions between players [online](/online "Dark Souls 2 online") (co-op and invasions).  
This is, for example, to prevent a player of a certain level that is close to the end of the game from invading/doing co-op with a player of the same level that might be still in the first areas of the game.

If you wish to play with others, you must be within a similar Soul Memory range. Higher Soul Level characters can still be paired with lower leveled characters who have similar Soul Memory ranges.

  * Soul items and boss souls you pick up add to your Soul Memory only when you use them.
  * You can check your Soul Memory on your Player Status screen, the top right-hand number.
  * Souls picked up from your bloodstain after dying won't add up to your soul memory.
  * Souls lost upon dying a second time without touching your bloodstain still count in your soul memory. 
    * It is better to always recover your souls on the bloodstain if you don't want to get “underleveled”.
  * **A summoning range calculator can be found[here](/Summon+Range+Calculator "Dark Souls 2 Summon Range Calculator").**

### Facts about Soul Memory in Dark Souls 2

  * Soul Level does not matter in summoning — it is purely Soul Memory that affects it.
  * NG shares the same ranges as NG+.
  * The Soul Memory threshold flattens out at 360M. Once you pass this threshold, you can summon and be summoned by anyone else past it, regardless of how large the gap is! If your SM is 360M and your friends are 999M, you can still summon each other regardless.

### Soul Memory Tiers and Exact Ranges for Multiplayer Connections in Dark Souls 2

Note that the specifics may be subject to change in future calibrations, but this appears to be precisely how it works for now. Tested on PS3.  
  
_**How are the ranges calculated?**_

  * Soul Memory is divided into tiers, but the tiers are not hard boundaries. Instead, different multiplayer items extend across different amounts of neighboring tiers. So there's no direct math involved, it's a question of 
    * A) What tier am I in? and
    * B) How many tiers above and below my own can I pair up with?

  * It is NOT anything like +/- 25%, 50,000, etc.
