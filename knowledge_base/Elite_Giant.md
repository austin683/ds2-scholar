**Great Giant Warrior** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.   

  

  

True, gargantuan giants with holes for faces, they will hit extremely hard with the huge mace-like weapons they carry. Fought as a pair.its attacks are unblock able and will go straight through your shield.   
Im not so sure how much health it has, but it is around 2000-3000, its attacks do 500-900. my tip is to stay right behind its legs and attack only once every now and then. sometimes it may hit you with one attack how it plunges both its weapons back and it can hit you if not careful. its mostly weak as hell if it cant hit you id also recommend wearing vengals armour for fights with this creature if there are two or one other giants try to lure the weaker one away.
