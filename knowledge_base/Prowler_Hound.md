### Prowler Hound (Kobold) Strategy Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * For the ones in Things Betwixt: research has found it best to use a weapon that has a good AOE in front of the players character and without locking on. These do not drop anything. Only the ones in Aldia's Keep and the Shaded Woods drop what is found on the loot table.
  * Just kill one and run to a place where there is no grass to hide. Aim your camera perspective on the floor in front of you and just hit them like that until all are dead.
  * Kobolds in Aldia's Keep can petrify. 
  * After killing all of them (5) until they stopped respawing, their total drops included: 1 [Black Knight Greatsword](/Black+Knight+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Black Knight Greatsword"), 2 [Black Knight Ultra Greatsword](/Black+Knight+Ultra+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Black Knight Ultra Greatsword"), 5 [Shotel](/Shotel "Dark Souls 2 Shotel"), 3 [Crescent Axe](/Crescent+Axe "Dark Souls 2 Crescent Axe"), 3 [Drakekeeper's Greataxe](/Drakekeeper's+Greataxe "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper's Greataxe"), 1 [Black Knight Greataxe](/Black+Knight+Greataxe "Dark Souls 2 Black Knight Greataxe"), 2 [Black Knight Halberd](/Black+Knight+Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Black Knight Halberd") and 4 [Affinity](/Affinity "Dark Souls 2 Affinity"). The character wore the [Jester's Cap](/Jester%27s+Cap "Dark Souls 2 Jester%27s Cap") and the [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring").
