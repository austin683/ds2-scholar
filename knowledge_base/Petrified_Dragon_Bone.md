### Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone Farming with Bonfire Ascetics:

  * 3 [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") in addition to 3 [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite") can be farmed indefinitely in [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon's+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon's Sanctum") by using a bonfire ascetic on the Tower of Prayer bonfire then making your way to the wooden chest after the spike trap room while making sure to pick up the bonfire ascetic in another wooden chest along the way. This method requires only a single bonfire ascetic to start and will replenish itself each run. The enemies on this run are very susceptible to Yearn / Alluring Skulls, which can make the trip much more efficient on higher bonfire intensities. The Bonfire Ascetic doesn't respawn in Scholar of the First Sin).
  * Alternatively, the Lair of the Imperfect bonfire in Dragon's Sanctum, although not infinite, this route provides 3 Petrified Dragon Bones, [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"), [Dried Root](/Dried+Root "Dark Souls 2 Dried Root"), a duplicate of [Drakeblood Greatsword](/Drakeblood+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Drakeblood Greatsword"), and more drops from [The Imperfect](/The+Imperfect "Dark Souls 2 The Imperfect").
  * Also, you can try farming the lizards at Dragon Aerie (and a corpse outside near the 2nd dragon has 2 bones every time). The Dragons have a chance to drop Bones.
