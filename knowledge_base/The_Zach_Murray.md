##  Build Strategy

When in PvP Just win, like it's not hard you casual are you a baby or something? Look, I'm not going to sugar coat this jawn for you babbies. This is Dark Souls, not Fairytale fighter or Naturo ninja storm alright? You gotta not suck to do good. Hit the R1 or RB or w/e click your mouse or w/e just hit things and they die it's not hard. If you aren't going 500-0 in the BoB arena then go pick a different build because you're no where near good enough for this. Listen to music while using this build, I suggest Judas Priest or Drake, anything that doesn't suck. I'm not going to sit here and say I believe in you, because I really don't, but at least your trying right? Please seriously don't use this build unless you're actually good enough, otherwise your getting banned so hard your head will spin or whatever.
