**Gyrm Great Hammer** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. Gyrm Great Hammer in Dark Souls 2 is a formidable weapon used by the nomadic Gyrm. Acquired by defeating [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior") with hammers, it cannot be infused with Bleed and is upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").

###  **Acquired From**

  * Dropped by [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior") (Hammer type)

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite"). Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * The R1 attacks have short reach, but they're quick for the weapons' size. One-handed R1 is slam right in front of you. It can hit multiple enemies if they're grouped tightly enough. Two-handed R1 is a spin followed by a slam.
  * The hammer's strong attacks are essentially all spinning moves that hit around you; the two-handed spin will inflict two hits at least--but it takes a large amount of your own stamina with each hit. The two-handed R2 strong attack will inflict massive damage, making it one of the most hard hitting weapons in the game.
