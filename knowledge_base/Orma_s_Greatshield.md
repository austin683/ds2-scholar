**Orma's Greatshield** is a [Greatshield](/Greatshields "Dark Souls 2 Greatshields") in Dark Souls 2. **Greatshields** can be used not only to block an enemy but allows player to do **shield bash**(Great shields replaced parry ability with heavy shield bash).

     _"Shield of the knights who long ago attempted to conquer the Undead Crypt._

     _They bore no weapons, only a shield split into left and right halves, which they used to playfully crush their foes until their corpses were kneaded beyond recognition._

     _The engraving depicts two messengers from the hereafter who welcome the recently dead by reviewing the merits of their deeds in life."_

### Acquired From:

  * Can be farmed from the two [Imperious Knights](/Undead+Crypt+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt Knight") in the Undead Crypt, along a long hallway with wall-phantoms near the 2nd bonfire
  * Drops from [Dark Spirit: Greatsword Bell Keeper](/Greatsword+Bell+Keeper "Dark Souls 2 Greatsword Bell Keeper").
  * Drops from [Dark Spirit: Greatsword Phantom](/Greatsword+Phantom "Dark Souls 2 Greatsword Phantom").
  * Drops from Dark Spirit: [Woodland Child Gully](/Woodland+Child+Gully "Dark Souls 2 Woodland Child Gully") in the Black Gulch (Scholar of the First Sin).
  * Drops from [Imperious Knight](/Undead+Crypt+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt Knight").

### Orma's Greatshield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * You can use the Power Stance with this and [Reeve's Greatshield](/Reeve%27s+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Reeve%27s Greatshield"); Reeve's must be in the right-hand slot and Orma's must be in the left-hand slot. These are the only shields in the game that can Power Stance. (Power Stance requires that you have 150% of the stats required for the item. You will need to have 50 Strength to power stance with the shields).
  * The combo attack for the Power Stance consists of smashing the edges of the shields together in front of you. The closer the target is to the grinding point of the shields, the more damage it takes.
