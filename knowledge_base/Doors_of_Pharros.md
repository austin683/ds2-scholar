## [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros")

  
**Doors of Pharros** is a [Location](/Locations "Dark Souls 2 Locations") in **Dark Souls 2**. This area is flooded and your movement will be slowed. There are large enemies and plenty of [Pharros' Contraptions](/Pharros'+contraptions "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' contraptions") for your [Pharros' Lockstones](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone"), but not all of them hide treasure. Some will even activate traps throughout the area.   
  
There are several (10-20) doors that can be opened in Doors of Pharros. One of the doors located on the second level of the large, open water area can be opened to reveal a bonfire with entrance into the [Royal Rat Authority](/Royal+Rat+Authority "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Authority") boss. Simply circle around the upper level of the main flooded chamber until you get to the last door and examine it (1st door if you go to the left.)   
You will also find the [Rat King Covenant](/Rat+King+Covenant "Dark Souls 2 Rat King Covenant") here.

### Doors of Pharros Walkthrough

### Access

Defeating the final boss [Scorpioness Najka](/Scorpioness+Najka "Dark Souls 2 Scorpioness Najka") in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") opens up a gate which leads to the start of [Doors of Pharros](/Doors+of+Pharros "Dark Souls 2 Doors of Pharros"). You'll enter a flooded area, and will immediately have to take on your first enemy of the area: a [Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight"). Once you've dealt with this one, make your way up the stone ramp to face the [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior"). Drop off this platform and enter the small cave entrance, on the right, to find **[Gyrm's Respite bonfire](/Gyrm%27s+Respite "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm%27s Respite")** on your right. Before entering however, notice the 10x [Prism Stones](/Prism+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Prism Stone") on the right.

Come back up to where you defeated the [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior"), and head left to find a [Dwarf](/Gyrm+Worker "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Worker") guarding a chest containing a [Dragon Charm](/Dragon+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Charm"). To the right is another set of stairs leading to a room with NPC [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan") and a corpse holding a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). There is a spiraling stairway in this room that leads to the entrance of [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"), but we still have lots to do here. For now, head back down to the bonfire. 

### Santier's Spear

In the area past the bonfire, there is another [Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight"), and a [Mongrel Rat](/Mongrel+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Mongrel Rat") to deal with -UNLESS you've become a member of the **Rat Covenant** , in which case, they become non-hostile. Many**Pharros Contraptions** line the walls but they are only helpful for members of the **Rat Covenant**. The scripted invader [Bowman Guthry](/Bowman+Guthry "Dark Souls 2 Bowman Guthry"), will also attack in this area, if you are playing offline. On the far side, you'll find a corpse holding 2x [Amber Herb](/Amber+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Amber Herb"), while the doorway to the left leads up to a platform overlooking the rest of this area, with a corpse holding a [Gyrm Axe](/Gyrm+Axe "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Axe") and a [Torch](/Torch "Dark Souls 2 Torch"). Collect them then head back down. Find a big door in this room that has two **Pharros Contraptions** on either side, and a single Pharros Contraption in the water, in front of it. Activate the one in the water to raise the bottom middle of the door. The [Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight") can be easily dealt with, as it is unable to pass the door, allowing you to go through the hole, loot the chest containing [Santier's Spear](/Santiers+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Santiers Spear"). Go through the door on the left of the area, near where you picked up the herbs. Up ahead, you encounter two more [Mongrel Rats](/Mongrel+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Mongrel Rat") before a ladder.

### Fighting the Rat Authority

Climb up and loot the corpse for the [Twisted Barricade](/Twisted+Barricade "Dark Souls 2 Twisted Barricade") and a [Soul Of a Proud Knight ](/Soul+Of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul Of a Proud Knight"). Take care of the two [Gyrm Warriors](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior") ahead, take them out then look for the Pharros Contraption that lies in between the initial position of both [Warriors](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior"); this lockstone opens a path in the area below with the [Mongrel Rats](/Mongrel+Rat "Dark Souls 2 Mongrel Rat") which contains a chest holding a [Faintstone](/Faint+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Faint Stone") and a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). To reach a third [Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior"), continue along the narrow path, until you come across a section of the wall that has become spiked. Continue past it, making sure to avoid touching it and losing unnecessary health. You'll find him guarding a Trapped Chest containing a [Titanite Chunk](/Titanite+Chunk "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Chunk") and a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). He is responsible for the spikes on the wall, by hitting a button behind the chest. (Also, beware that he is able to trigger a horizontal sandwich spike trap if you engage him from a distance without killing him, making your life ever so harder, so refrain from attacking this one until you know you can finish him too (Needs Certification)). Be careful not to engage him near the chest, as one of you may end up breaking it and missing out on its contents.

Continue on the narrow path and up the small stairs, check to the left of these small stairs for a [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and a [ Pharros Lockstone](/Pharros+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros Lockstone"), then continue into the next room. You are now on the second level of the room from earlier. Ahead are more **Contraptions** and [Gyrm Warriors](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior"), some petrified, others not so much. Continue along the narrow path, taking out anymore [Warriors](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior") that come your way. Half way down you will find a room to your left. Inside is **[Ordeal's End bonfire](/Ordeal%27s+End "Dark Souls 2 Ordeal%27s End")** and a fog door, but don't go through it just yet. Head back out and continue left. Soon you will reach the opposite side of the room with 2 more [Gyrm Warriors](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior") and a corpse holding a [Soul Of a Brave Warrior](/Soul+Of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Soul Of a Brave Warrior"). When you are ready, return to the **bonfire** and go through the fog door to face the boss of the area.

BOSS FIGHT: [Royal Rat Authority](/Royal+Rat+Authority "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Authority")

### Rounding Up Before Tseldora

After you have dispatched the [Rat Authority](/Royal+Rat+Authority "Dark Souls 2 Royal Rat Authority"), head to the right from where you entered the fog, to take a path that leads to a small room with the [Rat King](/Rat+King "Dark Souls 2 Rat King") in a hole on the left. Going further will drop you back near the first bonfire, take the stairs to the left to go back to [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan"). Now is finally the time to head up the spiraling stairs. Upstairs is a long hallway with a [Gyrm Warrior](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior") at the end. Careful, as this one likes to throw his axes at you. Up ahead, you'll also find a [Crystal Lizard](/crystal+lizard "Dark Souls 2 crystal lizard"), kill it quickly or it will run off the edge; you can approach the lizard from the [Brightstone Cove](/Brightstone+Cove+tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove tseldora") first bonfire, which makes things much easier. Far ahead is another two [Gyrm Warriors](/Gyrm+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Warrior") on the other side of a narrow walkway, while closer to your right you'll also find a [Dwarf](/Gyrm+Worker "Dark Souls 2 Gyrm Worker") sitting next to a brazier. Kill them and move to the other side and through the door at the end.

Travel up the long, winding stairs to reach a room with a broken fountain and some Urns. In the Urns to the left, find a corpse holding a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). Proceed through the door to enter [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora").
