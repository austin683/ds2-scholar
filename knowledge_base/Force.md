**Force** is a Miracle in Dark Souls 2. To cast a Miracle, you must use a chime or Special Weapons that can cast Miracle.

> "An elementary miracle  
> Releases a shockwave that staggers foes.  
>   
> Pushes nearby foes back, but leaves them unhurt.  
> Does not directly cause damage, but can be highly effective with a little ingenuity."

### Acquired From

  * Purchase from [Licia of Lindeldt](/Licia+of+Lindeldt "Dark Souls 2 Licia of Lindeldt") and [Cromwell the Pardoner](/Cromwell+the+Pardoner "Dark Souls 2 Cromwell the Pardoner") for 1800 souls.

### Notes

  * This spell is a great early choice for Faith-based characters, as its fast casting time can help against some enemies with unpredictable attack patterns. It also works fairly well in PvP, as of calibration 1.08, Force has the range of a spear's length. Has been able to break guards with 2 or 3 connections with the spell.
  * Extremely useful on pushing down enemies into bottomless pits, especially [Skeletons](/Skeleton "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton") if paired with [Yearn](/Yearn "Dark Souls 2 Yearn"), resulting in instant kill regardless of Faith.
  * Extremely high "Stability Damage"
  * Effective for clearing poison statues in Black Gulch and The Gutter.
  * Almost twice as fast to cast as the Dark Souls 1 version.
  * Does not aggro NPC, since it does not deal any damage.
