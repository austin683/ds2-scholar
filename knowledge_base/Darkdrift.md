> 
> Effect: shield piercing (strong attack) 

### How to get Darkdrift in Dark Souls 2

  * Talk to [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne") in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") after obtaining the [King's Ring](/King%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Ring").
  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") if you kill Agadyne.

### DS2 Darkdrift Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite") to +10.
  * Darkdrift's strong attack has a shield piercing effect.
  * Does slightly less poise damage compared to other katanas (15 instead of 20) but is also the lightest katana by far, weighing a mere 3 units.
  * Has less counter damage than most other katanas which is crucial for generating high damage blows.
  * Don't approach Agdayne with your torch lit or he and the other undead warriors will become hostile.
  * The katana's blade is barely visible, usually only glimmering when performing an action, or when then camera is angled correctly.
  * If you receive the Darkdrift from Agdayne, and then procede to kill him, you can buy a second from [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia").
  * Previously used with Mundane in old patches of the game, currently is better uninfused, raw or elementally infused.
  * Powerstance Strong Attack with two Darkdrifts is quite handy for shield piercing and stunlock, however the blade is considered short.
