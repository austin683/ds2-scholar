### Soul Geyser Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Shoots four [Soul Spears](/Soul+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Soul Spear") each dealing magic damage. Can pierce through multiple enemies. Each [Soul Spear](/Soul+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Soul Spear") deals around the same damage as a [Great Heavy Soul Arrow](/Great+Heavy+Soul+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Great Heavy Soul Arrow"). If all four spears connect, it is the highest damage-dealing sorcery in the game.  
This spell is also used by [Leydia Pyromancer](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer"), they cast this spell with [Blue Flame](/Blue+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Blue Flame") straight sword catalyst.  
  

  * Not useful on small targets, but very useful against big, slow enemies such as bosses. The casting speed is roughly the same as [Soul Vortex](/Soul+Vortex "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vortex"). The length of staff affects its starting cast point, making it miss at short range with a [Staff of Wisdom](/Staff+of+Wisdom "Dark Souls 2 Staff of Wisdom").  
Before calibration 10. it was considered to be the only useful spell against [Old Iron King](/Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Old Iron King"), it deals approx 800 damage to him at NG+4 onward, higher than [Great Resonant Soul](/Great+Resonant+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Great Resonant Soul") due to the boss' dark resistance.  
As of calibration 10. this spell suffered a major poise damage downgrade.
