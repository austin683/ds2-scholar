_"An old armor that is oddly comfortable. Belonged to a Ironclad. To this day, the forbidden love of Prince of Alken and the Princess of Venn manipulates these marionettes. Surely they never imagined that their dolls would outlast their own kingdoms."_

_Scholar of the First Sin Changed to:  
"Armor worn by Ironclad Soldiers. Provides high defense, but is so heavy that it requires great strength to move.  
_

_The Ironclad Soldiers were minions created by the Old Iron King, their life granted by an enchantment of souls. By now this is again an iron husk, and fit to wear._

_Once, the Old King could have unraveled the greater mysteries with the aid of his great soul, but he was led astray by his enormous fortune, becoming nothing more than a vulgar hedonist"_

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Ironclad Soldiers](/Ironclad+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Ironclad Soldier") in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep").

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Chestpiece grants immunity to backstabs.
  * Requires 14 STR.
  * There's also [old version](/Old+Ironclad+Set "Dark Souls 2 Old Ironclad Set") of this set found much earlier, in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). It has the same weight, but a bit lower stats (10–20%) and only half the durability.
