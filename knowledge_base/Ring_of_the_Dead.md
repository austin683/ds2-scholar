**Ring of the Dead** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **The Ring of the Dead** bestows upon the wearer a human appearance even in the wretched state of Hollowing. Legends tell of the Undead Crypt, a place to commune with the departed. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> The wearer of this ring appears human even when Hollow. They say that in the Undead Crypt, we can reacquaint ourselves with the dead. We all suffer loss. And none of us can escape death. Then, what is the fascination with reclaiming that which has already passed into that beyond?"

### DS2 Ring of the Dead Tips and Notes

  * After releasing the woman and going down the lift, you'll hear singing, perhaps from the woman. This will only happen once.
  * You can go back to the Shrine of Amana and talk to the singing woman after releasing the girl that gave you the ring. She will give you a fire seed. This girl is located behind the locked door above the Rise of the Dead bonfire. You will need to be Hollow to enter.
  * There is another singing woman in a small hut near the entrance to the Shrine of Amana who will give you 1 [Divine Blessings](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing") for saving her sister.
  * The ring cannot be used to fool [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan").
