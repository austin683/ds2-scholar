**Poison Brumer (Poison Horn Beetle)** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.   

  

  

Are these beetles the source of the poison that fills the earth below the mines, or are they merely the only insects that can survive in these conditions, either way, they suit the Queen`s tastes perfectly. 

  
  
  

###  Strategy tips

  

  * Just smack it! Very slow, hit it before its mist attack, use range or wait it out if you are too late.
  * Very slow enemy that cant chase you at all.
