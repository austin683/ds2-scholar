**Astrologist's Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Astrologists believe that magical powers can be obtained at moments of special heavenly alignment.  
>    
>  Even the collective wisdom of the Melfian Magic Academy cannot pull magic out of the sky, but the ideas of the astrologists led to the creation of new and very useful magic devices.
