**King's Ring** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **King's Ring** , a soul, is much like a curse. And those with strong souls must bear within themselves an even stronger curse.

### DS2 King's Ring Tips and Notes

  * King [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") will be walking around near the ring. Initially he will not be hostile towards the player. Attacking with massive amounts of damage will cause him to turn hostile and engage a boss fight which will put up a fog wall at the entrance. If the player dies a new fog wall will be infront of the room which houses King Vendrick. It is highly recommended to collect the ring first before aggravating Vendrick.
  * Talking to the old firekeeper in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt "Dark Souls 2 Things Betwixt") after obtaining the ring will net 6 [Human Effigies](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). If soul level 1 then she will not give the effigies and will only say to "go along now."
  * Talking to [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne") after getting the ring will net Agdayne's armor and the [Darkdrift](/Darkdrift "Dark Souls 2 Darkdrift") katana.
  * Upon obtaining the ring, Stone Trader Chloanne will sell various infusion stones, 1 Titanite slab, 3 Twinkling Titanite & 3 Petrified Dragon bone.
  * Ring is removed from player's inventory upon entering a new game cycle.
  * After obtaining the ring, it is possible to get to the throne of Want (ending area) & defeat Throne watcher & Defender, however Nashandra won't spawn until Giant's Kinship is obtained. Thus all 3 King's doors have to be opened to finish the game.
