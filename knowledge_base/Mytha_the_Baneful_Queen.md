### NPC Summons

[Jester Thomas](/Jester+Thomas "Dark Souls 2 Jester Thomas") can be summoned for this fight. His summon sign is located in the recessed area before the fog gate that is filled with poison. Although not a prerequisite, burning the windmill in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak") and stopping the flow of poison, will drain this area, making it considerably easier to see his summon sign. He is a pyromancer and, since Mytha is weak to pyromancy, is very useful in this fight.

### Strategy

After using a **Torch** to burn away the Windmill's Blades (see [Earthen Peak walkthrough](/Earthen+Peak "Dark Souls 2 Earthen Peak")), the room will now **only** have poison around the edge of the arena. If you do this it makes the fight much easier and also allows for an easier entrance into the fight, because the poison in front of the steps leading up will also be drained (completely). During the fight most of her attacks are single or double strikes with her spear, however you can easily anticipate them. Occasionally she will throw in a random triple strike attack, but if you dodge any of her first attacks it is easy to avoid the others. If you drained the poison from the room, she will periodically move over to the edge of the room to regenerate health. This is a good opportunity to use your strong ranged attacks, such as Lightning Spear if you are using miracles. After doing this she will either attack with a powerful thrust attack or Soul Arrow shot from her severed head. Block the Thrust, and dodge the Soul Arrow. The fight is very easy once you drain the poison and you should have no problem taking her by your self.

#### Melee strategy

Even without draining the poison, it is possible to kill her rather easily with a powerful strike weapon (I used a non-upgraded Demon's Great Hammer). Evade one of her attacks to create an opening, then attack her with the 2 handed strong attack for massive poise damage (2 attacks with the DGH were enough for me). Rather than staggering, she will actually be paralyzed for 2-3 seconds, leaving time for you to heal and recover from poison damage. As soon as you heal evade her coming attack and repeat. If you require more poise damage try using the stone ring.

#### Jester Thomas strategy (Easy mode)

The Baneful Queen is incredibly vulnerable to pyromancies, and the easiest way by a long shot is simply kite her and let the NPC **Jester Thomas** do the heavy lifting. Thomas takes a moment to enter the arena so aggro her, preferably with a shield with 90% or more magic damage reduction as she will likely use a few Soul Arrow shots. Then simply kite her with the shield up as Thomas kills her. If she should turn towards Jester then simply step in and hit her to regain her attention.   
In SOTFS, you can summon 2 more shades to help you ( **Bashful Ray** and **Devotee** ; summoning signs found near the staircases below/above the Central bonfire), for a total of 3 shades. You can just stand there to win! The shades will do everything for you.

### Dark Souls 2 Mytha, the Baneful Queen Hints

  * Some of her attacks can be parried.
  * You can drain the poison from her room, leaving only a small moat and plenty of space to fight her without suffering damage over time. This is done by lighting a torch and burning the windmill.
  * Her tail can be cut off stopping her from using her swipe attack with it, making the fight easier.
  * She is resistant to magic, but susceptible to hexes. Pyromancy absolutely wrecks her. Swathe does a ton of damage to her.
  * The moat of poison around her will heal her, try to keep her out of the poison
