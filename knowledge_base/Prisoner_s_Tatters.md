_"Rags worn by imprisoned Hollows. This appears to have been worn on the body._

_Judging by its looks and apparent virtues, this really is no more than a tattered scrap of cloth. It still carries the stench of a Hollow."_

### Location

  * Dropped by the Prisoner enemies in [The Gutter](/Gutter).
  * Dropped by the Hollows in [Huntsman's Copse](/Huntsman%27s+Copse).
  * Dropped by the Hollows in [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt) (rare).
  * Dropped by the Hollows in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley).
  * Dropped by the Hollows in [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints).

### Notes

  * Part of the [Prisoner's Set](/Prisoner's+Set)
    * The helmet and chest pieces raise [Item Discovery](/Item+Discovery).
    * One way to obtain the entire set is to fight hollows just after the 2nd Undead Crypt bonfire; they spawn infinitely (throughout multiple gravestones) and do not require a rest at the bonfire for them to respawn (albeit, the drop rate is rarer than in other locations).
    * Prisoners in [Harvest Valley](/Harvest+Valley "Harvest Valley") and [the Gutter](/the+Gutter "the Gutter") drop variations of the tatters and the hood
  * Upgraded from [Titanite](/Titanite+Shard).
