**Ashen Idol** is an [enemy](/enemies "Dark Souls 2 enemies") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**(DKS2)**. **Ashen Idols** are fragments of Nadalia's soul. There are a total of 11 scattered in different locations. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls.

### Dark Souls 2 Ashen Idol Information

Nadalia, a [child of Dark](/Children+of+Dark "Dark Souls 2 Children of Dark"), scattered her souls into fragments and influenced the Brume Tower with the idols (Similar to the concept of Phylactery or Horcrux, once all idols are destroyed, then Nadalia herself is destroyed) that have effects such as cursing an area with dark fog, reanimating enemies covered with ash, and healing enemies with [Warmth.](/Warmth "Dark Souls 2 Warmth") In order to dispatch them, plunge the [Smelter Wedge](/Smelter+Wedge "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Wedge") item into the idols. While doing so you're temporarily invulnerable for a brief second. Highly recommended to go for a suicidal run to purge the cursed rooms since they won't respawn.

### Ashen Idol Location in Dark Souls 2

There are 11 idols:

  * The first ashen idol is just above the stairs next to the first bonfire of Brume Tower.

  * The second one is shortly afterwards in a room you get to by a descending ladder, try to dispatch the enemies around it before approaching it, as getting near to the idol buffs the enemies.

  * The third one is in the room with [Ashen Warrior](/Ashen+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Warrior") throwing firebombs at you and the [Iron Warrior](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior").

  * The fourth one is in the separate tower near the [Foyer bonfire](/Foyer "Dark Souls 2 Foyer"), with the [Majestic Greatsword](/Majestic+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Majestic Greatsword") at the bottom. It's guarded by [Maldron the Assassin](/Maldron+the+Assassin "Dark Souls 2 Maldron the Assassin") and it buffs enemies, revives [Possessed Armors](/Possessed+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Possessed Armor"), and curses you. Wearing the [Hollow Skin](/Hollow+Skin "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Skin") can make this easier to reach by mitigating the curse effect.

  * The fifth one is behind the locked door behind the place near the [Foyer bonfire](/Foyer "Dark Souls 2 Foyer") where you put the [Scorching Iron Scepter](/Scorching+Iron+Scepter "Dark Souls 2 Scorching Iron Scepter"). It does the same as the one above.

  * The sixth one is near the [Life Ring +3](/Life+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Life Ring"). From the [Foyer Bonfire](/Foyer "Dark Souls 2 Foyer"), take the coal elevator to the very top. After stepping off the elevator take a left and follow the pathway along the wall of the tower until it ends. Here you'll see another elevator which you need to use to cross over to the other side of the path (at the same level). Follow this short path until you reach a door. Open it and you'll find an [Iron Warrior](/Iron+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Iron Warrior"), four doors, and a chest with the Life Ring +3. The idol is behind the glowing, third door.

  * The seventh one is where you are invaded by the [Prowlers](/Prowlers "Dark Souls 2 Prowlers"), on the way to the [Smelter Throne bonfire](/Smelter+Throne "Dark Souls 2 Smelter Throne").

  * Ashen idols 8 to 11 are next to the [Fume Knight](/Fume+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Fume Knight") battle, and can heal the boss if he approaches them.

### Ashen Idol Drops in Dark Souls 2

  * [Soul of Nadalia, Bride of Ash (fragment)](/Soul+of+Nadalia%2C+Bride+of+Ash+%28fragment%29 "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Nadalia%2C Bride of Ash %28fragment%29")

### DS2 Ashen Idol Notes and tips

  * If your character is hit and staggered out of the stab animation, it may become impossible to activate the idol a second time, meaning all associated rewards will be unavailable for that NG cycle. There is currently no known fix, so be sure to clear the area of enemies or be sure that you can activate the idol safely.
  * Using a bonfire ascetic does NOT revive the Ashen Idols. (tested at the Lowermost Floor bonfire).
  * Since one smelter wedge can be acquired after defeating [Sir Alonne](/Sir+Alonne "Dark Souls 2 Sir Alonne"), an ashen idol should be skipped when encountered in order to have enough smelter wedges to destroy the four at the bottom of Brume Tower in order to make the boss fight easier. The two best ones to avoid at first are (as listed above) number 4 and 5, as they are near bonfires and can be tedious to get to.
  * Four more smelter wedges can be found up the elevator in the Foyer and then up the elevator directly ahead. Once at the top of this elevator, proceed right. You will run into Possessed Armors and Ash Knights. Once you defeat them and head up two spiral staircases, there will be a chest on your left and the exit on your right.
