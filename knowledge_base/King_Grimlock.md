##  Build Pros/Cons

**Pros:**   
.Huge damage potential   
.Excellent physical defense   
.Can use the most basic miracles and most pyromancies   
.Me Grimlock King!!   
  
**Cons:**   
.Slow swings are susceptible to parries   
.Only 1 available spell slot   
.Only able to fast roll if the Third Dragon Ring and the Royal Soldier Ring are used   
.Dino mode not included   

###  Notes:

.Recommended covenant would be the Blue Sentinels (fits his character best)   
.If you want an 'Age of Extinction' version, just change the chest armor to Havel's, and the helmet to the Aurous Helm (Visible)   
.It may take some time to get used to PVP'ing with an Ultra-Greatsword, so take time, be patient! Swinging away in a match is an easy way to get killed or backstabbed.   
.You may have an easier time fighting without target lock-on, as Ultra-Greatsword strikes and be directed mid-swing with the left thumbstick   
.Just remember to be patient, and have fun!
