**Grand Spirit Tree Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Shield of the blue spirit tree that and is said to possess divine powers._

     _Appears in the allegory of Quella, God of Dream, and can deflect spells by parrying._

     _Once there was a boy who was easily frightened, until the talking tree of dreamworld transformed itself into a shield to protect him."_

### DKS2 Grand Spirit Tree Shield Acquired From

  * From [Ironhearth Hall](/Ironhearth+Hall "Dark Souls 2 Ironhearth Hall") in the [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep") head past the two Ironclad 'Turtle-knights'. There should be a lever to your right and a door to your left, go through the door and use a Pharros' Lockstone to reveal a breakable wall opposite the door leading to the Belfry Sol bonfire. Proceed through [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol") until you reach a room with a metal chest and a set of stairs leading downwards. Take the stairs. The shield is located in a chest behind an illusory wall on a platform over looking the Belfry Sol bonfire.

### Grand Spirit Tree Hints and Tips in Dark Souls 2:

  * Upgrades with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * As the description suggests, this shield's parry animation also deflects spells.
  * Trivia: The shield's description mentions Quella, God of Dream. This could be a character/concept that [Miquella](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miquella "Dark Souls 2 Miquella") of Elden Ring was based upon.
