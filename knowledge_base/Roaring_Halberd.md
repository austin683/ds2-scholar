### How to get Roaring Halberd in Dark Souls 2

  * Trade 1500 souls and the [Skeleton Lord's Soul](/Skeleton+Lord%27s+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Skeleton Lord%27s Soul") to [Straid of Olaphis ](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis").

### DS2 Roaring Halberd Hints & Tips

  * Same moveset as [Halberd](/Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Halberd"), but with dark damage instead.
  * Also has longer reach than default Halberd due to its size.
  * Due to its inherent Dark damage, a Dark infusion paired with INT/FTH build is recommended to maximize damage output.
  * A Raw infusion can assist with a minimum stat requirement build, at the cost of scaled damage, which reduces usefulness in the late game. 
  * **Roaring Halberd******’s “sweet spot” is located at the center of the blade, and provides an extreme damage boost compared to hitting an enemy with the shaft.
