### Leggings of Aurous Invisible Description

"_Leggings of kings of the desert land of Jugo. First worn by Aurous, the land's heroic founder._  
_According to legend, the armor of Aurous is composed of a mysterious substance that cannot be seen by cowards. What do your eyes tell you?"_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Spend 16000 souls at [Maughlin's](/Maughlin+the+Armourer) shop in [Majula](/Majula) then come back when you have zero souls. Talk to him and he'll give you the set.
  * Armor can be dropped by Dark Spirit [Rhoy the Explorer](/Rhoy+the+Explorer) in [Grave of Saints](/Grave+of+Saints).
  * 

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite).
  * Raises equipment load (+5% for full set).
  * Contrary to popular belief, this set does not become visible by ranking up in the [Company of Champions](/Company+of+Champions). Rather, the visible set is dropped by a Dark Spirit at [No-Man's Wharf](/No-man%27s+Wharf) in NG+.
  * Armor becomes visible when aiming a bow. This can only be seen briefly as you change to First-Person view.
