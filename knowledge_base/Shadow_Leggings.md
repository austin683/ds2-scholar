**Shadow Leggings** is a **Legging** and a part of [Manikin Set](/Manikin+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Shadow Leggings Description

"Used to hide in the cover of night. Those who are especially adept assassins are often hired as bodyguards.  
In an attempt to stave off the curse, King Vendrick hired shadowmen to put down the Hollows, but before long they were Hollowed themselves"

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Drop from Suspicious Shadow (NG+) or with the use of a Bonfire Ascetic at the No Man's Wharf bonfire.
  * 2 shadows appear with the boss. Drop rate is "Rare" even with stacked item discovery and rusted coins.

### Notes

  * Upgraded with Titanite
  * Gauntlets need 16 Dex to use
  * Gauntlets have bleeding attack
  * Can drop duplicates.
  * The mask resembles the one worn by healer Ingward from  _Dark Souls_ , which is believed to be based on Plague Doctor Mask, but without hood.
  * The two suspicious shadow NPCs have noticeably different headgear. One wears the standard shadow headpiece, while the other appears to wear
  * Great Lightning spear works wondrously.
