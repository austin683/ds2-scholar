**Bell Keeper Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"A wooden parma issued to bell keepers. Very light, and requiring hardly any strength._

     _The bells symbolize forbidden love; the bell keepers, their faithful guardians, ever-ready to annihilate trespassers._

     _They will stand watch, for ever and ever, these determined, if ill-fated, marionettes."_

### Bell Keeper Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * This shield has particularly strong magical defense as it sits at a reduction of 85 and has even stats spread across for elemental damage such as fire, lightning, dark etc which all sit at an even 20, unfortunately the shield only blocks 60% of incoming damage and therefore is not a recommended choice.
  * You may infuse it with magic to make it a good early magic defense shield until you obtain the [Magic Shield](/Magic+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Magic Shield").
