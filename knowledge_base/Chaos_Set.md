**Chaos Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
_Hood changed to: "Hood worn by a chaos sorcerer. The man claims to have sealed himself away, but who's ever heard of sentient magic?_   
_It is no doubt difficult to judge the veracity of the man's words, but this hood certainly seems to possess an unusual power."_   
_"Robe/Gloves/Leggings worn by a chaos sorcerer. He calls himself Navlaan, now."_

###  Set Location

  * Given by [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan's](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan) once his quest line is complete (he only talks to hollows).
  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Merchant Hag Melentia") (15k, minus hood) if Navlaan is killed.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Twinkling Titanite").
  * The hood improves casting speed and grants +3 to INT.
  * Requires 16 INT and 16 FTH.
  * Robe offers the highest fire defense (equal to that of [Hexer's](/Hexer's+Set) robe), as well as second highest dark defense (almost equal to that of [Agdayne's](/Agdayne's+Set) robe).
  * Gloves offer second highest fire defense (almost equal to that of [Hexer's](/Hexer's+Set) gloves, [Syan's](/Syan's+Set) gauntlets and [Tattered Cloth](/Tattered+Cloth+Set) manchettes).
  * Boots offer the highest fire defense (equal to that of [Hexer's](/Hexer's+Set) boots) and the highest dark defense.
  * Compared to [Hexer's](/Hexer's+Set) set, Chaos set is slightly superior in dark defense and identical in all other stats.
  * The hood comes with eyepatches, for covering the fact that Navlaan is a failed recreation of Fenito, as crimson eyes is a feature of a Fenito, while the successors are the [Aldia Warlocks](/Aldia+Warlock).
