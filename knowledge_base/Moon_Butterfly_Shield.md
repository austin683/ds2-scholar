**Moon Butterfly Shield** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Shield depicting the moon butterfly. A decorative shield not intended for battle, but effective at poisoning foes._

     _Little is known about the moon butterfly, which only appears on full-moon nights in winter.  
Some say the butterfly is a magical being, and its larvae have never once been spotted."_

### Acquired From

  * [Maughlin the Armorer's](/Maughlin+the+Armourer "Dark Souls 2 Maughlin the Armourer") house, in the back, up a ladder. (Found in NG++ or burn 2 [Bonfire Ascetics](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"))

### Moon Butterfly Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Imbuing the shield with Poison Stone gains 100% poison resistance (weapons and projectiles only), and additional poison build up while bashing.
  * With a +10 Poison upgraded shield and 40 dex the shield has 312+148 poison aux without poison boosting equipment, at 50 dex this rises to 312+154, with 50 dex, Crest of the rat and Sactum soldier gauntlets the poison aux increases to 312+284!
  * While two-handing this shield and using the light attack, your character will be considered blocking and the attack cannot be interrupted(unless stamina runs out). This, paired with the enormous poison damage you can get by imbuing it with poison, makes offensive use of this shield more effective than you may originally think.
  * Strong magic shield buff would grant this shield 100% reduction of all types of damage as well as higher stability, making offensive use of this shield much more effective.
  * Unlike the armor set, this shield does not give off an AoE poison effect, so it is safe to keep equipped around [NPCs](/NPCs "Dark Souls 2 NPCs").
  * As of Calibration 1.15, this shield will have a weight decrease and physical reduction increase, making this shield even more practical for bashing.
