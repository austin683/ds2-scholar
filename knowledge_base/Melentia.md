### Merchant Hag Melentia Dialogue

**\- First Encounter**  
Buy something, anything…  
Come, now…Help an old woman… And buy something…  
Keh heh heh…

**\- Second Encounter (Majula)**  
Oh, you again.  
Go on…It's on the cheap for you.  
Keh heh heh…

**\- Meeting again**  
Buy something, anything…  
(or)  
Don't abandon a poor old woman…  
(or)  
I knew you'd be back…  
(or)  
You again? Keh heh heh…

**\- Using Talk Option (Cardinal Tower)**  
My name is Melentia.  
You a stranger to this land?  
All we get is strangers these days. Everybody's gone and run off!  
Drangleic's been a pile o' rubble since the war fought long, long ago.  
When the Giants crossed the sea.

**\- Using Talk Option (Cardinal Tower)**  
Seemed like the battles would never end.  
Poor folk like myself had nary a place to sleep.  
That's why I keep all me things right with me.  
You may travel light, but methinks you bear a burden of your own.

**\- Using Talk Option (Cardinal Tower)**  
They say these trees grew from the remains of the Giants.  
From each carcass sprouted new life, growing into what you see now.  
But you know what they also say. Don't believe what an old hag says!

**\- Using Talk Option (Cardinal Tower)**  
It's high time that I pick up and move.  
I've a bargain for you, next time we meet, my love.

**\- Using Talk Option (Majula)**  
Everyone's so stingy around here.  
Everyone's so stingy everywhere!  
You're my only customer. Don't make me beg, now, buy something!

**\- Using Talk Option (Majula)**  
We call this place Majula.  
Not too special, if you ask me.  
It's just the place… where everyone seems to end up.

**\- After spending 1,000 souls**  
Take these, if you want them. Keh heh heh…

**\- Leaving after using her services**  
Thank you kindly. Keh heh heh…

**\- Leaving without using her services**  
Lowly times, these are…

**\- Leaving without exiting menu**  
Keh heh heh…

**\- When attacked**  
Keh heh heh…  
Keh heh heh…  
You've no respect! Die, you rotten lout! (aggroed)  
That's not very nice, is it? (50% HP)

**\- When killing the player**  
Cruel, cruel world, this is… Keh heh heh…

**\- Returning after defeat**  
I'll have your guts for garters!

**\- When killed**  
 _dying groan_ (no captions)
