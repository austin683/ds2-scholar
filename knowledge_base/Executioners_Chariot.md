### Strategies

####  I (Gate Switch)

In this fight, there are 7 or 8 skeletons as well as two necromancers (Black Hollow Mage) that will resurrect skeletons you have killed. The first thing you want to do is kill the two necromancers. The first one is on your left about 2 or 3 doors down. Once she's dead dispatch the first three skeletons in the area. (note: Black Hollow Mage are female) All the while remember to hide in the doorways as the chariot makes his rounds. Getting hit will cause considerable damage, but if health is kept high, chances of death are unlikely. Once the first mage and 3 boneheads are done move down the way a bit further. Proceed with caution and check doorways consistently. There is a skeleton hiding on the right side who will shoot you with arrows. The 2nd mage is ways down and will be hiding in one of the doorways on the right. Kill her then finish of the rest of the skeletons. Now for the boss. One or two doors down, on the left you will see a _**switch you must pull.**_ (phantoms cannot pull the switch) That will drop the gate right next to it. Pull it right after it runs by you then back away two or three doors down. The boss will run into it, killing the rider and injuring the horse for about 200 - 300 damage. Get off two or three ranged attacks depending on how fast you can dish em out. Then close the distance between you and the boss. He has a charging attack that will eat nearly half your health even if you're blocking. Strafe him until he rears up and stomp attacks. Remember to roll away and not to the side since the tracking is somewhat good and the range is larger than it seems. If you get behind him he will donkey kick you, causing large damage. Also, he will use a dark bead-like attack that has impressive range and seems to lock onto you. While the horse is charging up it's dark magic attack, run to it's side. This presents a great opportunity to do damage to it. Just remember to strafe to the side slightly, since it slowly turns to face you as you attack it. The biggest thing here is to keep close to him and rolling when deemed nesessary. Should be fairly easy assuming you dealt with the mages and skeletons, just remember to take your time; rushing in ignoring the skeletons is a sure way to get yourself killed every time. This should go without saying but summoning someone to help kill them makes a huge difference. Good luck!

####  Strategy II (Ranged)

Here is another strategy that is relatively safe and doesn't involve going to the gate at all and staying relatively close to where you came in so as not to risk being run over:   
Find a doorway/barred crevice that has a clear view of the long hall so you can see the chariot coming around the bend. A light will appear on the wall before you even see the chariot. Equip Soul Vortex (this can cause a large area of damage), Fire Orbs, other strong spells or ranged attacks. Unleash these attacks at it and then quickly roll to safety in the crevice. Don't rush it, take care of any enemies that re-spawn and continue to chip away at the boss. It is advised to slay the necromancers and skeletons first. This should drain his health to the point where the chariot can no longer can jump the gap. The boss will atttempt to jump the gap, but will fall short and end up hanging on the side of the ledge. You can go around the hallway and you should see the horse at the end of it. You don't need to get close to him at all at this point. Equip Lightning Spear or another strong ranged attack and hit him from clear across the hallway. This should knock him down the hole, giving you an easy win. Also, don't choose a large weapon, if you are trying to hide and take care of the skeletons while wielding a large weapon it will hit the wall most of the time and cause your stamina to go down and leave an opening for the enemies.   
Edit: This can actually be done even easier. There are several alcoves in the outer wall, if you position yourself in there, you can shoot the chariot as it rides around the ring. Hit it every time it comes in your sight, this way you never have to leave the alcove and there is not a single risk, as long you make sure to take care of the necromancers and skeletons first. When the chariot gets below 30% hp, it will fall when attempting to jump the gap. At this moment all you have to do is shoot it from a distance and the chariot will fall to its death.

####  Strategy III (Poison Arrows)

It is possible to cheaply kill the Executioner's Chariot with little risk to the player.   
By hiding near one of the first alcoves that the Chariot will pass by, and shoot two poison arrows with each pass, you can whittle the Chariot's health down to about 30% after ten or so passes. At this point, you should hear the Chariot fail to make the jump in its circuit. Go around the hallway, and you will see the horse hanging of the side of the ledge, open to any sort of attack. At this point the player can simply do any attack to knock the boss into the hole, killing it, or finish the Chariot off at their own leisure.   
If you stand at the end of the pit where the chariot jumps he will jump over you (unconfirmed)

####  Strategy IV (Necromancer Exploit/Ranged)

Each of the necromancers seems to be linked to a particular group of skeletons. Upon immediately entering the fight, three skeletons attack you; they are the only ones linked to the first necromancer, who should be about three alcoves down to the left. If that necromancer is killed, the three initial skeletons won't be resurrected after dying. As long as the player doesn't go any further, none of the other skeletons will see the player and so they will never attack. This leaves the player free to hit the chariot using their ranged attack of choice, using any of the alcoves near the entrance for cover. Once the executioner has about 20% of his health left the chariot will fail to make the jump across the gap and stop making circuits around the track; at this point the player can follow the chariot's path and shoot it once with a ranged weapon to end the fight.   
**NOTE:** if you have the spell " [Yearn](/Yearn "Dark Souls 2 Yearn")" this fight becomes almost trivial. Cast Yearn as soon as you enter the fog and the skeletons will just ignore you, getting maimed by the Chariot. Find the first necromancer and kill her quickly. Dispose of any of the 3 initial skeletons left. Start running towards the lever. When you see the first skeleton, re-cast Yearn and move to the second Necromancer. After she and all the remaining skeletons are dead, pull the lever for a very easy boss fight.

####  Strategy V (easy method)

Enter the fog gate and run to the first door on your left, cast [yearn](/yearn "Dark Souls 2 yearn") across the hall. When the chariot runs by, run to the Necromancer a few doors down on the left and vanquish her and take her spot by the door then cast yearn again across the hall, repeat until all skeletons are dead. Stay put and use Binoculars and Soul Arrows as the Chariot comes around, take a shot then run back into the doorway as far as possible so you dont get clipped. Repeat until he crashes at around 25% life. Run down the hall til all skeletons are up then cast Yearn and run down and kill the necromancer on the right. Fire one cheap wood arrow at the executioner and watch him fall down the pit to his death. Go back and kill remaining skeletons and collect the loot.

####  Black Hollow Mage Set Farming:

This area is also a good place to net the [Black Hollow Mage Set](/Black+Hollow+Mage+Set "Dark Souls 2 Black Hollow Mage Set") and [Lizard Staff](/Lizard+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Lizard Staff") as the necromancers in this area always respawn as long as the boss is alive, try using the chariot to mow down the skeletons, cast [Affinity](/Affinity "Dark Souls 2 Affinity") or [Homing Soul Mass](/Homing+Soul+Mass "Dark Souls 2 Homing Soul Mass") to knock down the skeleton next to the 1st necromancer, kill her as soon as possible and flee with [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone") or [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather"). [Jester's Hat](/Jester%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Jester%27s Set"), [Prisoner's Tatter](/Prisoner%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Prisoner%27s Set")s and [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring") are required for the farming. Alternately, use [Yearn ](/Yearn "Dark Souls 2 Yearn")to drive out the skeletons and then take down the Necromancers.

###  Hints

  * Using a Bonfire Ascetic on the Purgatory Bonfire will reset the Executioner's Chariot
  * The spell [Yearn](/Yearn "Dark Souls 2 Yearn") or the object [Alluring Skull](/Alluring+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Alluring Skull") will distract the skeletons, making the first part of this fight significantly easier.
  * You could either pull the lever and proceed with the fight as normal, or snipe him as he goes around with a bow or arrow.
  * Some doorways are not deep enough to protect you from the chariot. Namely the one across from the archer skeleton.
  * The chariot will injure the skeletons but they recover almost immediately. If you try to rely on the chariot to kill them they will quickly bunch up on you and drain your Stamina, ultimately killing you.
  * Black Hollow Mages (Necromancers) are what resurrect skeletons if you hadn't noticed yet. That goes for bone heads in every area; if you notice skeletons are being brought back there is a Necromancer in the area.
  * If you are building up Faith you can use the Lightning Staff Miracle to dish out quick damage to the boss when he crashes through the gate. Also can be used during fight as well.
  * If you are using a Bow, Poison Arrows will be effective (See Strategy III). About 4-5 hits will poison the Chariot, draining approximately 25% of its life.
  * The Horse has the similar attack patterns as the Armored Boar from Dark Souls 1, with the exception of the dark breath attack.
  * If you are trying for Melee, few of his attacks will hit you from the side and are easy to evade without rolling. During the dark breath attack, if you sit just behind his head, the breath won't hit you and you can slash away while he pushes you along the inside of his turn.(confirmed)
  * It is possible to roll over the spikes attached to the Chariot's wheels, but should be used as a last resort if taking cover should lead you to be overwhelmed.
