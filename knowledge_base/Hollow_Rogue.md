### Dark Souls 2 Hollow Rogue Information

_“Dangerous in life as thieves and highwaymen, these Rogues are now doubly so in death, as Hollowing has robbed them of their reason._  
_In life, they may have lusted after material wealth, but in death they seek your very Soul._

_The undead rogues are figures that wear dark trousers and brown clothing with a hood. Most dual wield fast small weapons, while some carry small ranged weapons that fire either arrows or bolts. They often attack in groups. They are found in Huntsman's Copse.”_
