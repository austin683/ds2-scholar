**Ring of the Evil Eye** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in [Dark Souls 2 (DKS2)](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). **Ring of the Evil Eye** is an unpretentious yet curiously disquieting ring. Absorb HP fallen foes. Gaze too long at the uncommon gem forming the eye of this ring, and disconcerting shapes might emerge. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> A modest, but inexplicably disturbing ring. Absorb HP for each enemy defeated. Peer too closely at the rare stone that forms the eye of this ring, and things that writhe and stir may come into focus.

### DS2 Ring of the Evil Eye Tips and Notes

  * There is a reported glitch that sometimes viewing bloodstains while this is equipped you will receive the passive heal. - Specific details of why/how are unknown at this time (the video is fake, it's an obvious time skip between health gains with the healing ring (Going frame to frame from 0:06 to 0:07 shows the time skip clearly). [Video example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nIgwYG5zLM).
  * Edit: it most certainly does heal you viewing bloodstains. Possibly when enemy covenant members die as not all bloodstains trigger the healing effect.
