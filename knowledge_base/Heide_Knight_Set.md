**Heide Knight Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Greathelm/Chainmail/Gauntlets/Leggings worn by Heide Knights.  
>   
> Whether Heide refers to a kingdom or was just a name for the land is not clear, for no records date back far enough to tell.   
>  All that is known is that the Way of Blue has its origins in Heide, and that Heide was later subsumed by the sea.

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Heide Knights](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") (between 1st and 2nd bonfires; spawns once), in [The Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille") (on the way from Exile Holding Cells bonfire to [McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff")'s smithy) and at the exit from [Shrine of Winter](/Shrine+of+Winter "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Winter"). Use [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") to farm the set. 
    * [Scholar of the First Sin] Heide Knights are regular enemies in [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame"), so farming the set is much easier, although it's still not a frequent drop. There's also one Heide Knight lancer in water prison of [Sinner's Rise](/Sinner's+Rise "Dark Souls 2 Sinner's Rise").
  * Alternative helmet – [Heide Knight Iron Mask](/Heide+Knight+Iron+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight Iron Mask") – is found in [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue"), in a chest next to [Blue Sentinel Targray](/Blue+Sentinel+Targray "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinel Targray"). 
    * [Scholar of the First Sin] Mask is a guaranteed drop on NG (can still drop on NG+) from a Heide Knight found in [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter") (spawns once): find the first [Swollen Mongrel](/Swollen+Mongrel "Dark Souls 2 Swollen Mongrel") past a long bridge, turn in the opposite direction, cross the house and drop down.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * The best way to get the set (pre-SotFS) is to kill the knight in Lost Bastille: follow the path from Exile Holding Cells bonfire, since there's only one other enemy on the way. Using a greathammer will make this simple, as your heavy attack will stunlock the red phantom and the Heide Knight. If you are having trouble killing that Heide Knight, summon Pilgrim Bellclaire to your aid (her sign is found next to Ruin Sentinels' arena).
  * Heide Greathelm is a decent item for dressing as Solaire of Astora from _Dark Souls_ , although the helm has an entirely different design, and is lacking the red feather on top.
