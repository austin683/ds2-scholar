**Twinblade** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2.  
  
**

> A twinblade fashioned from rare geisteel. Designed for high-ranking Drangleic knights, hence the decorative design. Geisteel equipment is of the finest make, but geisteel is so rare that very few of these weapons were actually used in combat.

###  Acquired From

  * [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille"): If you have [Antiquated Key](/Antiquated+Key "Dark Souls 2 Antiquated Key"), from the starting bonfire (or [McDuff](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff")), walk into the courtyard where a [mummy ](/Mummy+Gaoler "Dark Souls 2 Mummy Gaoler") falls from the platform and there is a [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer"). Break through the wood blocking a hole in the wall and open the door there, proceeding through the area, wary of one mummy in the room. 4 [dogs](/Attack+Dog "Dark Souls 2 Attack Dog") wait in a courtyard. Make your way to the ladder down the right path and break through the barrels to reach the room with the [Pharros' Contraption](/Pharros'+Contraptions "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Contraptions"), where the Twinblade is located in one of the chests.
  * If you don't have it: From the [Servants' Quarters](/Servants'+Quarters "Dark Souls 2 Servants' Quarters") bonfire, walk up the stairs to the door. Cross a small bridge, and fight one staff wielding mummy (behind him is a body with loot). Then, walk into the tower. Exit the tower on the ground floor through the other door, wary of the second staff wielding mummy. Then, walk down the roofs and drop into the courtyard. There are 4 dogs, after killing them, you may want to knock the stone into the well, pulling up the 3 normal mummies. There is a ladder on the side of the smallish building, beyond the well. Kill the 3 [royal swordsmen](/Royal+Swordsman "Dark Souls 2 Royal Swordsman") (one in window, one on ledge, one in room), then go into the other room (getting the loot at the top of the grate first), and kill the two royal swordsmen. It is in one of the 3 chests in this room.
  * Can be purchased from [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex") for 5000 souls. Located at [Brightstone Cove Tseldora.](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora")
  * A +7 version can be found in [Memory of the Old Iron King](/Memory+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Memory of the Old Iron King").

###  Hints and Tips:

  * The base damage of this weapon is low, but you hit your enemy several times with each attack. This makes it advised to add either [bleeding or poison](/Status+Effects "Dark Souls 2 Status Effects") to the weapon, because the effect buildup is much faster than with other weapon types.
  * [Power Stance](/Power+Stance "Dark Souls 2 Power Stance") moveset is identical to [Halberd](/Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Halberd")-type weapons.
