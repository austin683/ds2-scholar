###  **Acquired From**

  * Sold by [Blacksmith Lenigrast](/Blacksmith+Lenigrast) for 1000 Souls.
  * Dropped by [Forest Grotesque](/Forest+Grotesque) in [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods).

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite) to +10.
  * Rapier is a dexterity-based weapon; it has high dexterity damage bonus (B scaling for dexterity).
  * Rapier makes a good defensive weapon. As any pierce-based weapon, it can be used to poke safely from behind a shield (attacking and blocking at the same time) but at the cost of reduced damage. However, attempting to use the previous attack to hit a shield might leave the user vulnerable after the attack is deflected. Another perk to using the rapier is its long-ranged moveset. It has long stabbing moves that can be used to punish and poke enemies at a distance. The downside to its thrust attacks is the lack of horizontal sweep, which isn't ideal when dealing with many enemies side ways. That aside, the main problem of many piercing weapons in Dark Souls II is the hitboxes and tracking of the thrust attacks, as they often miss and poorly track the target.
  * This weapon has a parry instead of a strong attack when wielded in one hand. This is handy when dual wielding as it gives you at least some defensive capability other than rolling if you've got the rapier in the right hand. Strangely enough if dual wielded with a curved sword the rapier will preform slashing motions during the powerstance attacks. It is unknown what damage type these are as the weapon is only supposed to be capable of inflicting thrust damage.
