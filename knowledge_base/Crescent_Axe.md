### How to get Crescent Axe in Dark Souls 2

  * Treasure from [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"): Near [Weaponsmith Ornifex](/Weaponsmith+Ornifex "Dark Souls 2 Weaponsmith Ornifex") there is a door guarded by a red lizard. Through this door and behind a bookshelf, there is a room with a spider that also hides the chest, containing the axe and [Soul Vortex](/Soul+Vortex#fex "Dark Souls 2 Soul Vortex#fex").

### DS2 Crescent Axe Hints and Tips

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite#fex "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite#fex") to +5.
  * Although classified as a greataxe, the Crescent Axe has the moveset of a regular axe class weapon; this makes its swings very swift for a weapon of its length. In addition, the Crescent Axe's 2H running attack is the halberd's spinning attack, and it's second 2H attack seems to be unique
  * The Crescent Axe is a sweetspot weapon. If an enemy is struck by the handle, they will only receive 50% damage.
