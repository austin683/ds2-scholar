## No-Man's Wharf

**No-man's Wharf** is a location in **Dark Souls 2**. It is a port town with undead pirates and plenty of treasure. The area makes use of the torch and fire features for enemy attacks and defenses, so be on the lookout for useful contraptions and bring a torch with you. Chase from Chase and Torr had quite a hard time getting through here, so make sure to follow our guide if you need any help!

### Notes/Tips:

  * Shooting an arrow at the bell will also call the ship. This can be used to skip certain sections of the area as you have no need to travel to the bell yourself this way.
  * The area is completely optional if you take the Pursuer's bird nest to reach here.
  * Lighting the sconces as you advance through the zone makes it substantially easier to navigate through if you die. Torches are your best friend in No-Man's Wharf.
  * Darkdwellers are afraid of light. If you have a torch out they will not rush you, and instead will shreik and flee away. If they flee for too long without being killed, they will become aggressive and attack you like normal. 

### No-Man's Wharf Walkthrough

### Reaching the Wharf from [Heide's Tower of Flame](/Heide's+Tower+of+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Heide's Tower of Flame")

From the area above where you defeated the [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider"), exit straight onto a walkway and into another tower with a spiral staircase. Descend down and hidden behind the staircase is a corpse with a [Monastery Charm](/Monastery+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Charm"). Go through the doorway and down the hall.

On your right the hallway opens up and you meet an [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") guarding a doorway. Kill the [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") and continue straight to the end of the hall where you find a corpse hanging over the railing with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") and a [Dark Troche](/Dark+Troches "Dark Souls 2 Dark Troches"). Close by are two corpses with a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight") and an [Old Knight Halberd](/Old+Knight+Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight Halberd"). Go back down the hall and into the doorway the [Old Knight ](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight")had been guarding.

Down the flights of stairs brings you to the next level down. Going left leads to a dead end where a Royal Guard protects a metal chest that contains 1x [Sublime Bone Dust](/Sublime+Bone+Dust "Dark Souls 2 Sublime Bone Dust"). To the right is a hallway which leads to a round room with a pressure plate elevator in the center. Stand on the plate and descend to the next level down.

At the bottom, head out into the flooded corridors, passing the first small alcove to find a larger area to your left. This area holds a [Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") and a few [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") that rise up from the waters. There is a doorway behind these enemies that is blocked by a petrified enemy._If you unpetrify it and go up the stairs you will find a[Primal Knight](/Primal+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Primal Knight") and a corridor. A body hang on the railing and it holds 1x [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard"), going left leads to a dead end at an iron door. Going right to the end of the hallway brings you to an iron chest in the alcove to the right which contains the [Knight Set](/Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Knight Set") of armor._

Continue and at the end of the hallway, a knocked out hole in the wall leads to path and a [bonfire](/bonfire "Dark Souls 2 bonfire"). Continuing on from here will bring you to No-Man’s Wharf. That being said, No-Man's Wharf could be considered an "optional" area as players can opt to take the large eagle behind [The Pursuer](/The+Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 The Pursuer") instead of taking the boat to [The Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille").

### From the Bonfire

As soon as the title prompts, letting you know you've arrived the No-Man's Wharf, you will be greeted by a [Stray Hound](/Stray+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Stray Hound") and a [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry"). Be careful here, as there two archers, one on the dock straight ahead and the other on the far right, who will continue to shoot fire arrows at you until you kill them, which is made more dangerous by the [Hollow Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") in this area that will try to douse you with thrown oil bombs. When they get it right, it hurts. In any case, if the archer hits you, take a step back until his arrows no longer reach you. From here you can snipe him with a bow and arrows. You may want to clear the immediate bottom level of enemies by luring them back to the bonfire, and light the multiple fire torches to give you better visibility of the area.

Head through the hole in the wall to enter a room with two more [Hollow Infantries](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry"). After dealing with them, head up the stairs where there is a chest containing a [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard"), and deal with the [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") on the balcony to claim a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight") from the corpse hanging off the ledge. Head back down and left. You should see a small shade sign of [Bradley Of The Old Guard](/Bradley+Of+The+Old+Guard "Dark Souls 2 Bradley Of The Old Guard") a bit in front of you and an item in the water to your left, which is a [Large Soul of a lost Undead](/Large+Soul+of+a+lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a lost Undead") and a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Climb up the steps next to you, and before you proceed left, beware that you'll be engaged by another four [Hollow Infantries](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry").

After clearing these, there are three ways you can go:

  * Heading right will bring you to a seemingly inaccessible room, blocked by some crates. Destroy these then attack the neutral torch wielding hollow, who is targetable but will not attack. You'll be attacked by another [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") shortly after. Pick up the 10x [Iron Arrows](/Iron+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Iron Arrow") here too.
  * Heading into the building on the left, you'll find a body holding 3x [Dark Pine Resin](/Dark+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pine Resin").Go up the stairs, kill the enemies that approach you and enter the building on the left.
  * Go up the stairs in the middle, which continues with the rest of the walkthrough.

You will be attacked by a [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian"), and a [Hound](/Stray+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Stray Hound"). Deal with them then break the carriages on the right and proceed. Here you should find the archer from earlier, as well as 3 [Hounds](/Stray+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Stray Hound") and a [Hollow Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") in front of the building. Once you got rid of those and the Hollow Varangian hiding inside the building, go to where the archer was. You should see a stone face ([Pharros' Contraption](/Pharros'+Contraption "Dark Souls 2 Pharros' Contraption")) on the ground, if you use a Pharros' Lockstone here, the overhead lantern will light and the Darkdwellers will be largely confined to building interiors. This makes travel significantly easier through No-man's Wharf. The rest of this walkthrough assumes you have lit this lantern.  
Enter the building on your left to dispatch 4 Varangians, some of them sleeping. There's a chest here containing [Brigand set](/Brigand+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Brigand Armor") and a [Bandit Axe](/Bandit+Axe "Dark Souls 2 Bandit Axe"). Dash up the stairs and take out another: if you're too cautious here, the bandit will hit you with a plunging attack on the stairs. In the room at the top of the stairs is a chest with a [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder") and a [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard"). Outside this room are two more archers. Dispatch them and note the locked gate here -- we'll open this later for a handy shortcut.

  
Go back to where the Pharro's Contraption was and go a bit further onto the ledge, then turn left. There, you can find a [Large Soul of a Proud Knight](/Large+Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Proud Knight"), and a [Small Smooth & Silky Stone](/Small+Smooth+&+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth & Silky Stone"). Grab these, drop down, and go up the stairs. On your way up, a [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry") will wake up in the alcove on the right side wall of the stairs, further up, another [Hollow Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") and [Stray Hound](/Stray+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Stray Hound") will wait for you. In the room on the left, you will find [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah"). If you have already met her at [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille") before (by flying there with the giant crow after the fight against the [Pursuer](/Pursuer "Dark Souls 2 Pursuer") in [The Forest of Fallen Giants](/The+Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 The Forest of Fallen Giants")), she will share a bit more of her story and give you a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy").   
On the left of the doorway, destroy the wooden structures to reveal a little alcove with a body holding [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Outside 2 [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") wait. Ahead, another 2 [Hounds](/Stray+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Stray Hound") and another [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") also wait. At the very right of the area, you will find a set of stairs up, and there will also be an archer, and a Oil Urn-tossing [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian"). This combination is no bueno. So either take them out quickly using ranged attacks, or run up the stairs. This will lead to the [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") area.

### Dealing with the [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller")

The [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") are not very hard unless you are impatient or over encumbered. The best way to go about this is to activate the Pharros contraption to raise the lantern, then bait them out one by one. Either way, as long as you avoid fighting multiple at the same time, they are still quite manageable:

  * Wielding your torch will cause them to cower for a upon initial contact. This gives you enough time to take them out, but if you're not quick enough, they will find their composure and ignore the torch.
  * Lightning or Fire are effective against these enemies.
  * If you don't have access to these or you're a melee build, try wearing light armor (25-50% load for the most agile rolls) and a reasonable shield (tested using [Crimson Parma](/Crimson+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Parma") & [Large Leather](/Large+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Large Leather Shield") shields). Simply move within range of their attack and then immediately retreat several steps.
  * As with most enemies, they will telegraph their attacks. When you see them hunching their shoulders before a swing, roll away then jump in and swing for one hit.
  * If they stagger, which they generally will, continue to swing until your stamina is low or they die, then repeat. Watch your stamina to be sure you have enough stamina left to roll back and NEVER take on more than one at once. If you do, they will essentially stunlock you by trading off attacks and you'll be helpless against the cumulative Bleed damage.
  * Every single one of them _can_ be baited out on their own. Standard practice applies: If a second follows, simply back up until the second returns to their hidey-hole. If the target returns too, re-aggro it via melee or long-range attack. Arrows are useful for this.

**Note: Engaging the lantern will confine the[Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") to the shadowy rooms allowing you to bait them out one at a time! See above for details.**

### Past the First Dweller

Passing the first three [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller"), you'll find an item on a small cliff on the right. Pick it up (1x [Large Soul of a Lost Undead](/Large+Soul+of+a+Lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Lost Undead"), [Emit Force](/Emit+Force "Dark Souls 2 Emit Force")) then head into the room through the hole. You will find only a door in here, which you should open and then immediately roll away as a [Darkdweller](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") destroys the wall to reveal a two [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") in the room, with another set to jump down through the hole in the ceiling. Once dealt with, head upstairs and take care of the final [Darkdweller](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") in this building. The door in here will lead to a room with a hole in the wall on the right, and two chests on the left. Of the two chests, the one on the right contains a poison trap, which you can trigger by opening it then rolling away to avoid damage. Within in, find 2x [Silver Talisman](/Silver+Talisman "Dark Souls 2 Silver Talisman"). The chest next to it is a lot more straightforward, and contains the [Greatsword](/Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Greatsword"). Drop down the hole and continue to the end of the path. Head up the stairs dispatch the 2 [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") here. Go out the doorway, then left up a set of stairs to a platform. There's a bell here with a lever. Pulling the lever will cause the bell to ring and the ghost ship in the harbor to move towards the dock, so that you can eventually access it, and ultimately the [Flexile Sentry boss](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry").

Continue on, dropping down the gap to the left of the bell. There's a corpse here with 2x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"), and a [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"). Drop underneath the platform you just dropped from, and then again and kill the [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") standing directly below you, and the one hanging off the side on the left. Open the door and head into the small room with containing two more [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller"). Halfway up the stairs is a corpse with 10x [Fire Arrow](/Fire+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Fire Arrow"). Head back out the room and down the ramp to trigger a [Suspicious Shadow ](/Nimble+Shadow "Dark Souls 2 Nimble Shadow") to drop from his hiding place near the door. At the bottom of the slope, you'll get jumped by another so keep your guard up.

Head down the rock ramp and drop down to the stone-paved yard. Head straight past the brazier on your right, to an archway leading to a door and a room. Opening the door, go straight ahead to an Illusory Wall. Inside are two chests with a [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard") and 3x [Firebomb](/Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Firebomb"). Head back out and up the stairs to fight a waiting [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") then continue up to the NPC [Lonesome Gavlan](/Lonesome+Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Lonesome Gavlan"); you can sell gear you don't need to him for some extra souls.

Continue behind him, and raise the shortcut portcullis by pulling the chain, which leads back to a ledge above the courtyard with the **Pharros' Contraption**. Now backtrack to the ground floor and head back to where you originally dropped down. Just past here on the left is a small room with two sleeping [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian"), and a bunch of urns filled with poison. Another [Shadow](/Nimble+Shadow "Dark Souls 2 Nimble Shadow") will show up when you get near the door. Lure the [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") outside, and dispatch them. Once back in the room, don't break any urns unless you do so from a distance with a long spear or such. Entering the room, on the left are two urns blocking a corpse with [Throwing Knife](/Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Throwing Knife") x7 and a [Flame Butterfly](/Flame+Butterfly "Dark Souls 2 Flame Butterfly"). In the right corner, behind some other urns is a chest with a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore"). To the left of the chest is an unstable wall which you can shatter with a strong leaping attack or a spell. Behind the wall is a [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard"), so move quick. There's also a chest in here with a [Royal Soldier's Ring](/Royal+Soldier%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier%27s Ring").

### Yo Ho! A Pirate's Life for Me

Head back out of the room and right to a stone stairway heading down. As you near the bottom, you'll see to [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") with their butts sticking out of a large hole in the wall. Past the room, continue straight onto a dock. You'll see notice a corpse hanging off a boat to your right. Head past that for now, and turn right. There are two more [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") hiding here, hanging off the side of the dock. Take care with them but with caution, as falling off the far side of the dock is instant death. Once they're gone turn right back towards the beach; there's another [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") playing dead in the water here. Take him out, and you're clear to loot the corpse hanging on the dinghy, for [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") x2 and a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy").

Continue on, pass where the [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") were hanging to find a summon sign for [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah"). Continue left down a narrow dock and kick the wooden platform to open a shortcut to the starting area. Now head left and up some stairs to reach [Carhillion of the Fold](/Carhillion+of+the+Fold "Dark Souls 2 Carhillion of the Fold") at the top, and if your intelligence is 8 or above, he'll sell to you. Exhausting his dialogue will send him to go to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). Head back the way you came, but this time head down the dock towards the ghost ship. Once you board the ship, head immediately left and up onto the raised platform on the bow, and take out the Archer here quickly. A [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") and a [Gaoler](/Gaoler "Dark Souls 2 Gaoler") will come running from the other end of the ship. Deal with them, and then head toward the ship stern. Head through a small doorway and down the stairs into the hold to the boss mist.

BOSS FIGHT: [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry")

After defeating the boss proceed to the next room and up a ladder to find a chest and a strange contraption; the chest contains a [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") and a [Fireball](/Fireball "Dark Souls 2 Fireball"), while examining the contraption triggers a cinematic showing the player sail the ship to the next area, [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille").

### No-man's Wharf Walkthrough

From the area above where you defeated the [Dragonrider](/Dragonrider "Dark Souls 2 Dragonrider"), exit straight onto a walkway and into another tower with a spiral staircase. Descend down and hidden behind the staircase is a corpse with a [Monastery Charm](/Monastery+Charm "Dark Souls 2 Monastery Charm"). Go through the doorway and down the hall.

On your right the hallway opens up and you meet an [Old Knight ](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") guarding a doorway. Kill the [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") and continue straight to the end of the hall where you find a corpse hanging over the railing with a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") and a [Dark Troche](/Dark+Troches "Dark Souls 2 Dark Troches"). Close by are two corpses with a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight") and an [Old Knight Halberd](/Old+Knight+Halberd "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight Halberd"). Go back down the hall and into the doorway the [Old Knight ](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight")had been guarding.

Down the flights of stairs brings you to the next level down where you encounter an [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight"). The left passage leads to a dead end so we'll head right to find yet another [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight"), and beyond a hallway which leads to a round room with a pressure plate elevator in the center. Stand on the plate to descend to the next level down.

At the bottom, go through the doorway into the flooded hall. An [Old Knight](/Old+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Old Knight") will stand in a room on the left, in front of a doorway. Past the doorway and up the stairs, the left path leads to a dead end at an iron door. Going right to the end of the hallway brings you to an iron chest in the alcove to the right, which contains the [Knight Set](/Knight+Set "Dark Souls 2 Knight Set") of armor. Go back down the stairs and return to the lowest level. Head left and at the end of the hallway, a knocked out hole in the wall leads to path and a [bonfire](/bonfire "Dark Souls 2 bonfire") where the NPC [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah") stands in rest against a stone spire. Continuing on will bring you to the location [No-Man’s Wharf](/No-man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man%27s Wharf").

### From the Bonfire

As soon as the title prompts, letting you know you've arrived the No-Man's Wharf, you will be greeted by a [Stray Hound](/Stray+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Stray Hound") and a [Hollow Infantry](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry"). Be careful here, as there two archers, one on the dock straight ahead and the other on the far right, who will continue to shoot fire arrows at you until you kill them, which is made more dangerous by the [Hollow Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") in this area that will try to douse you with thrown oil bombs. When they get it right, it hurts. In any case, if the archer hits you, take a step back until his arrows no longer reach you. From here you can snipe him with a bow and arrows. You may want to clear the immediate bottom level of enemies by luring them back to the bonfire, and light the multiple fire torches to give you better visibility of the area.

Head through the hole in the wall to enter a room with two more [Hollow Infantries](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry"). After dealing with them, head up the stairs where there is a chest containing a [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard"), and deal with the [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") on the balcony to claim a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight") from the corpse hanging off the ledge. Head back down and left. You should see an item in the water, which is a [Large Soul of a lost Undead](/Large+Soul+of+a+lost+Undead "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a lost Undead") and a [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"). Climb up the steps next to you, and before you proceed left, beware that you'll be engaged by another four [Hollow Infantries](/Hollow+Infantry "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Infantry").

After clearing these, there are three ways you can go:

  * Heading right will bring you to a seemingly inaccessible room, blocked by some crates. Destroy these then attack the [Darkdweller](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") (See below on instructions on how to deal with them). You'll be attacked by another [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") shortly after. Pick up the 10x [Iron Arrows](/Iron+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Iron Arrow") here too.
  * Heading into the building on the right, you'll find a body holding 3x [Dark Pine Resin](/Dark+Pine+Resin "Dark Souls 2 Dark Pine Resin").Go up the stairs, kill the enemies that approach you and enter the building on the left.
  * Go up the stairs in the middle, which continues with the rest of the walkthrough.

  
You will be attacked by a [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian"), and a [Hound](/Stray+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Stray Hound"). Deal with them then break the carriages on the right and proceed. Here you should find the archer from earlier. Deal with him then enter the building on your left to dispatch two sleeping [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian"). There's a chest here containing [Brigand set](/Brigand+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Brigand Armor") and a [Bandit Axe](/Bandit+Axe "Dark Souls 2 Bandit Axe"). Dash up the stairs and take out another: if you're too cautious here, the bandit will hit you with a plunging attack on the stairs. In the room at the top of the stairs is a chest with a [Repair Powder](/Repair+Powder "Dark Souls 2 Repair Powder") and a [Titanite Shard](/Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Shard"). Outside this room are two more archers. Dispatch them and note the locked gate here -- we'll open this later for a handy shortcut.  
  
Once all the bandits in the building have been eliminated, go back down to the courtyard outside the ground floor and move towards the cliff overlooking the beach. You should see a stone face ([Pharros' Contraption](/Pharros%27+Contraption "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Contraption")) on the ground and another Varangian bandit. If you use a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") here, the overhead lantern will light and the [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") will be largely confined to building interiors. This makes travel significantly easier through No-man's Wharf. **The rest of this walkthrough assumes you have lit this lantern.**

Dropping off a short ledge onto a roof after the Pharros' Contraption, head left to a corpse with a [Small Smooth & Silky Stone](/Small+Smooth+%26+Silky+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Small Smooth %26 Silky Stone") and a [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight"). Drop back down to the beach, taking care to avoid the [Darkdweller](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") in the room below. Heading back up the stairs to the landing in the middle, snipe/pull the [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") at the top of the stairs. Then, instead of continuing up the stairs, head left and up a flight of stairs to a waiting [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian"). There's a pantry shelf in the corner of the room, which you can destroy to expose a corpse with [Ring of Life Protection](/Ring+of+Life+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Life Protection"). Head out the doorway, taking care to deal with the[Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") just outside in an alcove on your left. Continuing ahead will bring you to another [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") and a [Stray Hound](/Stray+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Stray Hound"). 

### Dealing with the [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller")

The [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") are not very hard unless you are impatient or over encumbered. The best way to go about this is to activate the Pharros contraption to raise the lantern, then bait them out one by one. Either way, as long as you avoid fighting multiple at the same time, they are still quite manageable:

  * Wielding your torch will cause them to cower for a upon initial contact. This gives you enough time to take them out, but if you're not quick enough, they will find their composure and ignore the torch.
  * Lightning or Fire are effective against these enemies.
  * If you don't have access to these or you're a melee build, try wearing light armor (25-50% load for the most agile rolls) and a reasonable shield (tested using [Crimson Parma](/Crimson+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Parma") & [Large Leather](/Large+Leather+Shield "Dark Souls 2 Large Leather Shield") shields). Simply move within range of their attack and then immediately retreat several steps.
  * As with most enemies, they will telegraph their attacks. When you see them hunching their shoulders before a swing, roll away then jump in and swing for one hit.
  * If they stagger, which they generally will, continue to swing until your stamina is low or they die, then repeat. Watch your stamina to be sure you have enough stamina left to roll back and NEVER take on more than one at once. If you do, they will essentially stunlock you by trading off attacks and you'll be helpless against the cumulative Bleed damage.
  * Every single one of them  _can_ be baited out on their own. Standard practice applies: If a second follows, simply back up until the second returns to their hidey-hole. If the target returns too, re-aggro it via melee or long-range attack. Arrows are useful for this.

### Reaching [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan")

Passing a small room on your left, you'll come to the base of a stairway, which you should ascend. At the top, follow a pathway to the right. You'll see a room ahead, filled with [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller"). Unfortunately, you want to get in that room, because once you clear out all the [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller"), you'll be able to head up the stairs and find [Lonesome Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan"), to whom you can sell for souls anything you don't want. Note that you only get one shot in **No-Man's Warf** to sell things to [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan"); he will again appear later, but not too soon, and not here. Anyhow, back to the [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller"), be patient, pulling them out with ranged attacks one at a time, and taking care with their long reach. _DO NOT try to run past them to Gavlan; They will tear down the wall!_ A spear or halberd can be helpful. 

[pic of gavlan]

There are some Stalkers in the room below, more in the adjacent room, and more again upstairs. Once you get through them all there's a chest with 1x [Greatsword](/Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Greatsword"), and another POISONED chest on the right with 2x Silver Talisman, and [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan").

Heading back out of the [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan") building, note the corpse with [Emit Force](/Emit+Force "Dark Souls 2 Emit Force"), and a possible drop here to the next section. Better to head left to a wooden platform with a door on your left. Dispatch a Varangian Bandit here, and head (carefully) up the stairs to another who is ready to pounce. Go out the doorway, then left up a set of stairs to a platform. There's a bell here with a lever. Pulling the lever will cause the bell to ring and the ghost ship in the harbor to move towards the dock, so that you can eventually access it, and ultimately the [Flexile Sentry boss](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry").

### Journey to the Royal Solider's Ring

Continue on, dropping down the gap to the left of the bell. There's a corpse here with 2x [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem"), 1x [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"). Heading back to where you just dropped onto this roof, take another short drop. Turn around, and head into a small room with stairs heading down. There are two [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") below. Halfway down the stairs is a corpse with 10x [Fire Arrow](/Fire+Arrow "Dark Souls 2 Fire Arrow"). Lure them up the stairs, and/or head back out of the room and drop down to the rocky ledge below, which gives you access to a doorway leading into the same lower room where the Stalkers are.

Head down the rock ramp and drop down to the stone-paved yard. Head straight past the brazier on your right, to an archway leading to a door and a room. Opening the door, go straight ahead to an Illusory Wall. Inside are two chests with a [Large Titanite Shard](/Large+Titanite+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Large Titanite Shard"), 3x [Firebomb](/Firebomb "Dark Souls 2 Firebomb")s. Head back out and left up the stairs to a waiting [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian").

Continue behind him, and raise the shortcut portcullis by pulling the chain, which leads back to a ledge above the courtyard with the **Pharros' Contraption**. Now backtrack to the ground floor and head back to where you originally dropped down. Just past here on the left is a small room with two sleeping [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian"), and a bunch of urns filled with poison. Another [Shadow](/Nimble+Shadow "Dark Souls 2 Nimble Shadow") will show up when you get near the door. Lure the [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") outside, and dispatch them. Once back in the room, don't break any urns unless you do so from a distance with a long spear or such. Entering the room, on the left are two urns blocking a corpse with [Throwing Knife](/Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Throwing Knife") x7 and a [Flame Butterfly](/Flame+Butterfly "Dark Souls 2 Flame Butterfly"). In the right corner, behind some other urns is a chest with a [Estus Flask Shard](/Estus+Flask+Shard "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask Shard"). To the left of the chest is an unstable wall which you can shatter with a strong leaping attack or a spell. Behind the wall is a [Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard"), so move quick. There's also a chest in here with a [Royal Soldier's Ring](/Royal+Soldier%27s+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Royal Soldier%27s Ring").

### Yo Ho! A Pirate's Life for Me

Head back out of the room and right to a stone stairway heading down. As you near the bottom, you'll see to [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") with their butts sticking out of a large hole in the wall. Past the room, continue straight onto a dock. You'll see notice a corpse hanging off a boat to your right. Head past that for now, and turn right. There are two more [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") hiding here, hanging off the side of the dock. Take care with them but with caution, as falling off the far side of the dock is instant death. Once they're gone turn right back towards the beach; there's another [Varangian](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") playing dead in the water here. Take him out, and you're clear to loot the corpse hanging on the dinghy, for [Lifegem](/Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Lifegem") x2 and a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy").

Continue on, pass where the [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") were hanging to find a summon sign for [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah"). Continue left down a narrow dock and kick the wooden platform to open a shortcut to the starting area. Now head left and up some stairs to reach [Carhillion of the Fold](/Carhillion+of+the+Fold "Dark Souls 2 Carhillion of the Fold") at the top, and if your intelligence is 8 or above, he'll sell to you. Exhausting his dialogue will send him to go to [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"). Head back the way you came, but this time head down the dock towards the ghost ship. Once you board the ship, head immediately left and up onto the raised platform on the bow, and take out the Archer here quickly. Two more [Varangians](/Hollow+Varangian "Dark Souls 2 Hollow Varangian") will come running from the other end of the ship. Deal with them, and then head toward the ship stern. Head through a small doorway and down the stairs into the hold to the boss mist.

BOSS FIGHT: [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Dark Souls 2 Flexile Sentry")

After defeating the boss proceed to the next room and up a ladder to find a chest and a strange contraption; the chest contains a [Pyromancy Flame](/Pyromancy+Flame "Dark Souls 2 Pyromancy Flame") and a [Fireball](/Fireball "Dark Souls 2 Fireball"), while examining the contraption triggers a cinematic showing the player sail the ship to the next area, [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille").
