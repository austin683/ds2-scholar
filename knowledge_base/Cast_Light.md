### Cast Light Notes

  * A very useful spell to have if you are playing the Xbox One version of the game since the lighting system has been changed
  * Casts a light that illuminates the area for 50 seconds, can be a useful alternative to a torch,  
This will aggro [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne"), whether invaders can aggro Agdayne in the host's world with this spell is another question.
