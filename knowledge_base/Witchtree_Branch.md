### How to get Witchtree Branch in Dark Souls 2

  * The pit in the middle of Majula.
  * Once [Laddersmith Gilligan](/Laddersmith+Gilligan "Dark Souls 2 Laddersmith Gilligan") arrives in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula"), ask for him to create the 12,000 soul ladder. After climbing down the ladder, be sure to climb up the metal ladder to the left. The Witchtree is in one of the metal chests inside the room. Note: Requires '[Forgotten Key](/Forgotten+Key "Dark Souls 2 Forgotten Key")'.
  * You can acquire the Staff earlier by dropping from the pit using the planks. After reaching the last platform right before the first cave opening, drop from the right side of the plank to fall on the platform where the metal ladder is located. Use the [Silvercat Ring](/Silvercat+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Silvercat Ring") and lower your equip load to reduce fall damage. Note: You will still need the Forgotten Key to access the room.
  * Drops from the witchtree casters in eleum loyce and dark chasm.
