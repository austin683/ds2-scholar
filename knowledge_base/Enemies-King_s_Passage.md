## King's Passage Enemies

  

  

###  [Looking Glass Varlet](/Looking+Glass+Varlet) (Mirror Squire)

  

Phantoms which emerge from mirrors. They can come out of the [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight) boss's mirror shield, or out of the mirrors in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep). 

  

  

###  [Stone Knight](/Stone+Knight)

  

_Knights in the service of sir Velstadt, the Royal Aegis. When Velstadt left with Vendrick through the King's Passage the men under his command dutifully remained at their posts, awaiting his return for so long that they eventually turned to stone.1_   
  
Wearing heavy armor and a helmet resembling the head of a horse, these sleeping statues which won't activate until approached or attacked (from range). When activated, Stone Kights have glowing red eyes and wield twinblades. Even though the gear looks heavy, they are still very agile. They attack with combos which involve turns, jumps and kicks. They can be "destroyed" before they get up to attack, in which case they have less than half of their regular health, do not drop items and can be distinguished from actual statues by being the only ones with heads. They are found in [King's Passage](/King%27s+Passage). 

  

  

###  [Syan Soldier](/Syan+Soldier) (Royal Guard)

  

_High-ranking Drangleic knights whose weapons and armor are modeled after those borne by Sir Syan, one of King Vendrick's bravest military leaders. Sir Syan met a dishonorable end on the battlefield during the war with the Giants;' shortly thereafter all of the knights who had been issued replicas of his armor went insane after putting them on._   
  
Equipped with greatswords or halberds, these knights are also equipped with greatshields as well. They wear Syan's Set of armor, and have special lightning attacks they use rarely.
