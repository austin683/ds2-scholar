**Stone Parma** is a [Standard Shield](/Standard+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Standard Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Standard Shields** can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Shield of the castle stone soldiers._

     _Sir Velstadt could always be found at the King's side, and followed him when he fled.  
The knights in his service waited patiently for his return, but turned to stone before he did."_

### Acquired From:
