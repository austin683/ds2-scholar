**Desert Sorceress Skirt** is a **legging** and a part of [Desert Sorceress Set](/Desert+Sorceress+Set) in **Dark Souls 2**.

### Desert Sorceress Skirt Description

_"Sorceress Skirt from the distant land of Jugo. Appears to be a plain, thin fabric, but is permeated with powerful magic._  
_Desert Sorceresses have enchanting looks, and they use them to catch people off guard._  
_Oddly enough, even those who are perceptive enough to realize the ploy fall prey to their seductions with alarming regularity."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * Drops from [Desert Sorceress](/Desert+Sorceress) in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak).

### 

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore).
  * Hood grants additional Intelligence. (3 Intelligence)
  * Moderate to high petrification resistance for clothing.
  * The top enhances the chest size for female characters, along with [Singer's Dress](/Singer%27s+Dress).
  * The male variant has a different top and different boots; the skirt comes with an additional mini skirt. They share the same hood and gloves.
  * Ironically, this set is vulnerable to fire, despite Desert Sorceresses being users of pyromancy (or fire sorcery).
  * If the skirt is worn by [Rosabeth](/Rosabeth+of+Melfia), it doesn't have any sway animations, due to the NPC's idle animation being different from players.
  * Considered to be a decent light armor, you can make various ridiculous builds, such as one who power stances a [Bluemoon Greatsword](/Bluemoon+Greatsword) and a [Moonlight Greatsword](/Moonlight+Greatsword) without the worry of weight.
