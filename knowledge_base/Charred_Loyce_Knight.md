### DS2 Charred Loyce Knight Strategy Tips

  * If you are summoned into another player's world as a white phantom to assist with the Burnt Ivory King, the Charred Loyce Knights will still be capable of dropping their entire armor set as well as Loyce souls. This makes it quite easy to farm the set and the souls while still engaging in Jolly Cooperation.
  * Focus on the Pyromancer Knight whenever possible, and always keep moving. The pyromancer tends to separate itself from the pack, but getting swarmed by the melee knights can easily kill you.
  * Time your rolls well and always know where the pyromancer is.
