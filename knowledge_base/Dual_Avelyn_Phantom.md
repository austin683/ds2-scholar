Side-Notes:   

  * There is only one type of Dual [Avelyn](/Avelyn) Phantoms, yet there are two of them in their spawn location.
  * Drops some of the rarest items in the game, including the [Black Witch Domino Mask](/Black+Witch+Domino+Mask) and the [Black Witch Veil](/Black+Witch+Veil)(Needs comfirmation on this).
  * No real strategy, just be wary of the [Greatsword](/Greatsword) wielding phantom towards the fog gate, as he can climb the ladder to assist them.
  * Never respawns, can be fought again if using a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic).
