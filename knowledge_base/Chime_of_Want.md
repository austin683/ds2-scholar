### DS2 Chime of Want Hints and Tips

  * This chime has the same power as [Caitha's Chime](/Caitha%27s+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Caitha%27s Chime") but scales slightly better with a slower attack speed. However, it has the ability to cast miracles in addition to hexes.
  * When fully upgraded, the Chime of Want appears to be tied with a fully upgraded Caitha's Chime for highest dark damage and dark damage scaling. However, the "S" scaling is not equal, and the Chime of Want gives a larger bonus to dark damage than Caitha's Chime. The Chime of Want therefore has the highest raw dark damage of any of the chimes.
  * At 40/40 int/faith with both fully upgraded and infused with dark, Chime of Want has 32 more Dark Bonus. However Caitha's Chime has a casting speed of 145 compared to Chime of Want with only 130.
