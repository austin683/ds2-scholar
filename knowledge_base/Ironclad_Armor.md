_'Armor worn by Ironclad Soldiers. Provides high defense, but is so heavy that it requires great strength to move_

_The Ironclad Soldiers were minions created by the Old Iron King, their life granted by an enchantment of souls. By now this is again an iron husk, and fit to wear."_  
  
_Scholar of the First Sin added:_  
_"Once, the Old King could have unraveled the greater mysteries with the aid of his great soul, but he was lead astray by his enormous fortune, becoming nothing more that a vulgar hedonist."_

### Location

  * Drops off of Ironclad Soldiers in [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep).

### Notes

  * Part of the [Ironclad Set](/Ironclad+Set). 
    * Set requires 14 [Strength](/Strength).
  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite+SLab).
  * Immune to the backstabbing animation.
  * Since the developers of Dark Souls love the Berserk series so much they often sneak in equipment that looks like equipment used in the Manga. This set of armour looks like bazuso's from Berserk. (Example)-
