_"Hood/Armor/Gloves/Boots favored by pyromancers. They appear tattered but in fact the fabric is reinforced with pyromancy._   
_Magic is no show. It is an art that allows mere mortals to glimpse into the very fabric of what is and may be."_   
  
  

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by the [Darkdwellers](/Darkdweller "Dark Souls 2 Darkdweller") in [No-man's Wharf](/No-man%27s+Wharf "Dark Souls 2 No-man%27s Wharf").
  * Full set is found in [The Gutter](/The+Gutter "Dark Souls 2 The Gutter"): find a [Swollen Mongrel](/Swollen+Mongrel "Dark Souls 2 Swollen Mongrel") past the first long bridge, face the opposite direction, cross the house, drop down. Note: there's [Heide Knight](/Heide+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Heide Knight") right below that place.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Robe offers second highest poison resistance (almost equal to that of [Grave Warden](/Grave+Warden+Set "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Set") and [Northwarder](/Northwarder+Set "Dark Souls 2 Northwarder Set") robes).
  * Manchettes offer second highest fire defense (almost equal to that of [Chaos](/Chaos+Set "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Set") / [Hexer's](/Hexer's+set "Dark Souls 2 Hexer's set") gloves and [Syan's](/Syan's+Set "Dark Souls 2 Syan's Set") gauntlets) and second highest poison resistance (almost equal to that of [Northwarder](/Northwarder+Set "Dark Souls 2 Northwarder Set") gloves and [Shadow](/Shadow+Set "Dark Souls 2 Shadow Set") gauntlets).
