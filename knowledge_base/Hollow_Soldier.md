**Hollow Royal Soldier (Hollow Soldier)** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.   

  

  

A common soldier in the earlier areas. Hollow Soldiers often play dead -- posing as defeated enemies -- or otherwise set themselves up to ambush the unwary. Possessing some semblance of military tactics, they tend to be significantly more dangerous in groups. They wield various weapons such as Bastard Swords, Estocs, and Halberds. Some use a shield, and there is a common Spear and shield variant. They will also make use of Firebombs or Longbows to rain punishment on enemies from a high vantage point. They are the hollowed undead versions of the knights of the Royal Drangleic Army and wear armor and helmets which slightly resemble the Paladin set from Dark Souls.
