### Chancellor Wellager Dialogue

**\- When first met**  
Who are you…  
And by whose permission do you stand before me?  
This castle is the domain of King Vendrick. Is your trespass intentional?  
…  
His Highness…Where has he gone?

**\- When talking a second time**  
You are a guest of our castle. I am the Chancellor, Wellager.  
Do you seek an audience with my Lord, King Vendrick?  
Unfortunately, His Highness is absent.  
My Lord…The King has…  
The Queen…Has taken him…

**\- When talking a third time**  
My Lord made magnificent findings on souls… An accomplishment for the ages…  
He vanquished the Four Great Ones… And built this kingdom upon their souls.  
Our King has watched over this land… Since ages long, long ago…  
King Vendrick…We must fight back… Or the Giants will take Drangleic…

**\- When talking a fourth time**  
The King had a dear Queen, a woman of unparalleled beauty.  
Long ago, the Queen came to us, alone, from a faraway land.  
She warned our Lord of the looming threat across the seas…of the Giants.  
The King crossed the ocean… And defeated the Giants, with the Queen at his side.

**\- When talking a sixth time**  
The King commandeered their power… And created the Golems.  
With the Golems, the king created this castle.  
To celebrate victory… And to show his love, his gratitude to his Queen…

**\- When talking a seventh time**  
The Queen…Brought peace… to this land, and to her King.  
A peace so deep…it was like…  
The Dark…

**\- When talking an eight time**  
Is this…some sort of a dream?  
……  
Where am I? What has happened to our castle…  
Who are you…  
And by whose permission do you stand before me?

**\- When talking to him to open the interaction menu**  
Welcome, visitor…  
Our guests are treated with honour. This is the way of our castle.  
Tell me if you should require anything.

**\- When leaving**  
Gone so soon?  
Be safe on your travels…

**\- When walking off without closing the menu**  
Where has His Royal Highness gone…

**\- When giving equipment to the player after killing Giant Lord**  
The King of Giants… How did you slay that behemoth?  
Incredible…Now, take these…
