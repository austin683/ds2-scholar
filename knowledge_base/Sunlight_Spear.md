### Acquired From

  * Reaching rank 3 in the [Heirs of the Sun](/Heirs+of+the+Sun "Dark Souls 2 Heirs of the Sun") covenant (after offering 30 Sunlight Medals). You can acquire this spell only once per character, NG cycles do not apply to covenant rewards.

### Notes

  * Hurled bolt of lightning, considerably faster cast than its Dark Souls counterpart, more powerful than [Lightning Spear](/Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Lightning Spear") and [Great Lightning Spear](/Great+Lightning+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Great Lightning Spear"). This spell has a small AoE that will affect the original target and enemies that stand close to the original target. Knocks back the target.
  * If the enemy is in any body of water, it will conduct a stronger AoE that will also affect enemies within the blast radius.
  * The highest damaging miracle in the game. With 65 faith, [Lightning Dragon Chime +5](/Dragon+Chime "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Chime"), [Sun Seal](/Sun+Seal "Dark Souls 2 Sun Seal"), and [Lightning Clutch Ring](/Lightning+Clutch+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Lightning Clutch Ring") it deals approx 1400-1800 damage.
