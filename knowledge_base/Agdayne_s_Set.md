**Agdayne's Set** is an Attire or [Armor](/Armor "Dark Souls 2 Armor") in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

> Robe/Cuffs/Kilt worn by Agdayne of the Undead Crypt.  
>   
> Life itself is suffering; or karma, as some have called it.  
>   
> The embrace of death awaits all things. But does death mean an end to suffering?

###  Set Location

  * Received from [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne") after obtaining the [King's Ring](/King's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King's Ring").
  * Kilt is dropped from Agdayne if you decided to kill him. Tunic and cuffs are sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") (10,8k).
  * It's possible to get 2 full sets for doing both.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite").
  * Cuffs grant +1 to Faith.
  * Robe offers the highest curse resistance, as well as second highest dark defense (almost equal to that offered by [Chaos](/Chaos+Set "Dark Souls 2 Chaos Set") robe).
  * Cuffs offer almost the highest dark defense (only 2 points below that offered by [Dark](/Dark+Set "Dark Souls 2 Dark Set") gauntlets).
  * The armor resembles toga, tunic and sandals from Ancient Rome and Greece.
