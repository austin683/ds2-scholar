### Multiplayer Time Limits in Dark Souls 2

Summoned and invading phantoms have a limited amount of time before being expelled from the host's world. The decreasing amount of available time is signified by a change in the player's appearance; Their color will become darker as the timer counts down.  
  
In co-op, the time running out for the summoned player is still considered a success and they will be given the same rewards as if they helped the host defeat a boss (not including the boss's souls). Enemies defeated during co-op will subtract additional time, with tougher enemies generally removing larger amounts of time. As a result, players summoned using the [Small White Sign Soapstone](/Small+White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 Small White Sign Soapstone") might only last for a small duration of time, considering the short timer it has by default combined with the time subtracted by killing enemies. Though it is also possible to run out of time using the full-sized [White Sign Soapstone](/White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 White Sign Soapstone"), it has a much longer timer and is a lot less common.  
  
In PvP, the time running out on a hostile player is typically not considered a victory for anyone and is more akin to the player having used the [Black Separation Crystal](/Black+Separation+Crystal "Dark Souls 2 Black Separation Crystal") to end the session. However, one rare exception may occur when running out of time during a duel in one of the PvP arenas, where it may arbitrarily give one of the players a victory.  
  
[The Name-Engraved Ring](/Name-engraved+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Name-engraved Ring") increases the length of the timer by 50% for every form of multiplayer it works with.  
  
The length of the timers is set as a specific amount of seconds in the data, however for easier readability it is listed out as minutes + seconds in the table below.   
  

    
    
    | Multiplayer Item / Event | Phantom Type | Time Limit |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Small White Sign Soapstone | Shade | 8m 20s |
    | Small White Sign Soapstone w/ Name-Engraved Ring | Shade | 12m 30s |
    | White Sign Soapstone | Phantom | 66m 40s |
    | White Sign Soapstone w/ Name-Engraved Ring | Phantom | 100m |
    | Cracked Red Eye Orb | Dark Spirit | 15m |
    | Cracked Blue Eye Orb | Arbiter Spirit | 15m |
    | Red Sign Soapstone | Dark Spirit | 15m |
    | Red Sign Soapstone w/ Name-Engraved Ring | Dark Spirit | 22m 30s |
    | Dragon Eye | Dragon Spirit | 25m |
    | Dragon Eye w/ Name-Engraved Ring | Dragon Spirit | 37m 30s |
    | Crest of the Rat | Gray Spirit | 10m |
    | Bell Keeper's Seal | Gray Spirit | 10m |
    | Brotherhood of Blood Arena | Dark Spirit Duelist | 10m |
    | Blue Sentinels Arena | Blue Spirit Duelist | 10m |
    | Looking Glass Knight | Mirror Squire | 15m |
    | Dark Chasm of Old PvP | Abyss Spirit | 30m |
    | Dark Chasm of Old PvP w/ Name-Engraved Ring | Abyss Spirit | 45m |
    | Guardian's Seal | Blue Spirit | (infinite, but session ends when invader leaves) |
    

### Dark Souls 2 Bloodstains 

You will occasionally see a bloodstain on the ground. When you stand on it, you can activate it. Doing so will replay the last few seconds of another player's life at that location, ending with their death. The death usually does not take place at the actual bloodstain, similar to how your own bloodstain is usually not precisely where you actually died but rather where you were several moments before. The replay shows the slain player as a phantom, but does not show any other aspect of their death such as what specifically killed them (unless the phantom falls off a cliff or the like). However, much can be inferred from the replay, including possible nearby computer enemies that may be in ambush, or if PvP invaders are particularly active in the area (typically when the phantom is repeatedly circling and attacking, and then backstabbed or slain in only a few hits).

### Illusions in Dark Souls 2

Playing while being connected to the internet will cause images of other players to appear. Unlike in Dark Souls they are distinct at all times allowing you to see what weapons they are wielding, their armor, even if they are using items. These phantoms allow the player to know how active an area is since these phantoms seem to be appearing somewhat real time (you might see the same phantom twice doing the exact same things, and you might see a summon sign, and a light blue phantom putting it down afterwards). One cannot interact with them but you may move through them since the other players are not really in your world. If killed they will even be seen dying before completely vanishing, this will possibly lead to a bloodstain being left nearby. Seeing these phantoms the player can get some solace in the fact that other people are going through the same strife and troubles that they are personally facing.

### Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Phantoms

Near bonfires (and only near them), the above phantoms of other players may appear more distinct and visible than elsewhere in the game, showing all of their equipment and even whether they are in human form or not. Seeing other people resting at the same bonfire helps players realize that these people are probably facing the same challenges. Testing suggests you are also more likely to see distinct phantoms of those players at or very close to your own level, giving you a helpful sense of how active the area is at your level if you wish to place a summon sign at that bonfire, or look for signs to summon help.  
  

### Bonfire Kindling in Dark Souls 2

Players can burn a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy") at a bonfire to prevent multiplayer activity in that area. While active, the player may neither be invaded nor summon until the effect wears off or is canceled at the bonfire. Players can also burn an item named Bonfire Ascetic to raise the difficulty of the surrounding area by one playthrough (if in NG, the area will be equal to NG+), and this effect stacks and can not be reversed.

### Dark Souls 2 Cooperative Play 

Players can be summoned into another player's world to aid them as Phantoms by leaving a summoning sign with the [White Sign Soapstone](/White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 White Sign Soapstone") or [Small White Sign Soapstone](/Small+White+Sign+Soapstone "Dark Souls 2 Small White Sign Soapstone"). A new addition is the ability to voice chat with co-op phantoms. Phantoms are limited by a timer in the host's world. Normal White Soapstone summons last 40 minutes of gameplay. A good fact to note: when you help another player to defeat a boss you will get any replenish-able items and equipment durability back. Estus, any spells, etc. But if you fail to defeat the boss of the area in that person's world you will still be missing any replenish-ables you have used, even in their world. For example, you have 15 out of 30 soul arrows, you place a summon sign and help defeat a boss, when you appear back in your own world you will have all 30 of your soul arrows, same goes with estuses. But if you lose against that boss and used 3 soul arrows you will appear back in your world with only 12, which also goes with estus, replenish-ables and equipment durability.

### Covenants in Dark Souls 2

As the player explores the world, there will be certain opportunities which allow the player to make an oath to a person or on a specific subject, which causes them to effectively join a guild called a Covenant. When a Covenant is joined during the game, it will impact interactions with other players online. This could mean that taking an oath for something could make you allies with another player, or deadly enemies. The Covenant system is not an all encompassing fixed alliance like a MMO guild; instead it should be thought of as a system which serves as a guide for active roleplaying. Visit the [Covenants](/Covenants "Dark Souls 2 Covenants") page for more information. Generally, membership in a Covenant will afford you certain specific benefits such as a few unique spells or equipment, an increased likelihood of other members of the same Covenant encountering your summoning signs (or you theirs), and more narrative structure to your RPG experience. You are generally able to "rank up" in your chosen Covenant by various means, which typically gives you access to a few additional items, abilities, or spells. Many Covenants also have special online play characteristics that affect whether and how they can invade or be summoned by other players. Covenant choices are not permanent and usually may be abandoned and joined at will.  
  

### PvP Covenants in Dark Souls 2

Several covenants are focused on PvP for different purposes, some covenant's goals are defending an area by either invading the trespassers or summoning invaders from other worlds, while the rest are focused on dueling and invasion throughout the rest of the game world. Invasion items are varied, turf-war based covenants use a ring as the invasion tool, while dueling oriented covenant uses eye orbs as the invasion tool, there is also arenas where the victors will have eye orbs awarded to them for victory.

### Dark Souls 2 Online Notes and Tips

  * When another player is accessing their menu, their character will relax and slouch back their shoulders.
  * Support [Miracles](/Miracles "Dark Souls 2 Miracles") can be partially cast by holding the button down, where the animation begins and pauses allowing you or another player to have time to get in range of the miracle and then cast when the caster releases the button.
  * If you suspect an invader to be using hacks or cheats you can go into your Steam overlay, click on "View Players" in the Friends window, then go into the "Recent Games" tab and you can see the profile of the invader and thus report him for cheating by going to their profile.
  * If you are listening to music while playing (PC Only). The music will stop playing immediately on a player joining your game, this can help as an early warning to invaders, although it also happens when you summon phantoms or get summoned yourself.
