## Aldia's Keep Enemies

  

  

###  [Dragon Acolyte](/Dragon+Acolyte)

  

Scientist looking beings with warped orb hoods. They are fairly slow but taking a direct hit from their enchanted weapon or skull shield can prove to be quite deadly if lacking the proper armor and/or player stats. 

  

  

###  [Entity of Avarice](/Entity+of+Avarice) (Mimic)

  

A monster which looks like (mimics) a regular chest but will attack the player when opened or struck. The mimic will gobble up any player standing close to it, a move which deals high damage and can kill a player outright. 

  
_**One of two Iron Mimics in the game. (Needs confirmation)**_

  

  

###  [Basilisk](/Basilisk)

  

Frog-like creatures that cast the petrify effect on players by using a fog-breath attack, otherwise offer very little danger. A giant, and much more formidable, version will attack the player more directly. Unlike in Dark Souls, these enemies can inflict physical damage with a leaping attack.   
  
In [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods) and [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep), default Basilisk can be found in caves and trapped inside carriages.   
  
In [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora) there is a subspecies of Basilisk (a.k.a. Sand Basilisk) whose bulbous false eyes have completely atrophied as an adaptation to living in desert environments. This variant still attacks with petrifying breath but has also learned to burrow under the sand, enabling it to ambush its prey and travel undetected.   
  
In [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods) and [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep), there is a subspecies of Basilisk (a.k.a. Great Basilisk) whose the size is five times larger than normal basilisk and green skin tone whick makes them look like an enlarged treefrog, the range of the mist is much wider, and the melee attack can even break the cages.

###  [Great Basilisk](/Great+Basilisk) (Giant Basilisk)

  

An impressive Basilisk specimen of enormous size with mottled green skin like that of a chameleon. Whether these creatures are the result of a divergence in the species' evolutionary line of the product of an Aldian experiment in unclear. They are not actively predatory and will make no attempt to attack unless cornered, so observers not looking for a fight would be wise to give them a wide berth.   

  * An easy way to get rid of them is to shoot them full of arrows or ranged magic spells - they won't bother to retaliate unless you're close.

###  [Great Poison Brumer](/Great+Poison+Brumer) (Giant Acid Horn Beetle)

  

_A vastly overgrown Acid Horn Beetle. Whether these impressive specimens are the result of some misguided Aldian experiment or an unusually long life is unknown; they are extremely rare and only a few exist in Drangleic._

  
  

  

###  [Looking Glass Varlet](/Looking+Glass+Varlet) (Mirror Squire)

  

Phantoms which emerge from mirrors. They can come out of the [Looking Glass Knight](/Looking+Glass+Knight) boss's mirror shield, or out of the mirrors in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep). 

  

  

###  [Undead Aberration](/Undead+Aberration) (Enhanced Undead)

  

Grotesque monstrosities found wading in the dark water in [Sinners' Rise](/Sinners'+Rise "Sinners' Rise"), they attack much like the Titanite Demons from Dark Souls; they are slow but can hit extremely hard. They have a massive resistance to magic and fire damage, and also seem to resist lightning. They are not resistant to poison or bleed damage. They are difficult to fight in the water, but can be lured over to the elevator platform where one can hit them with ranged attacks or bait them to fall into the hole.   
  
They're believed to be Lord Aldia's attempt on recreating the dragons, these test subjects are either failed attempt or the the first step of mutation, since their bones are formed in the shape of a dragon.   
  
_This deformed, unnatural creature must surely be the product of some serious misdeeds. Who created this monstrosity, and is it what they intended to make? It almost seems to be half-dragon, but, whatever it is, it has a mind of a Hollow_   
  
Being a member of the Bell Keeper Covenant will make the Shield and Bow drop with very high frequency.

  

  

###  [Ogre](/Ogre)

  

Ogres are enemies in Dark Souls II. They can first be encountered up a hidden path before the bridge leading to the Firekeepers' house in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt).   

  * Ogres resemble a cross between a cyclops and hippopotamus, and possess a horn on their foreheads
  * Ogres have large amounts of HP and deal significant damage, and their attacks are relatively swift for enemies their size
  * Ogres can grab players and devour them, guaranteeing death for players. Ranged attacks and poison are recommended when dealing with Ogres 

  

  

###  [Prowler Hound](/Prowler+Hound) (Kobold)

  

Kobolds are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered just past the fields in [Things Betwixt](/Things+Betwixt) (they do not drop anything here).   

  * Kobolds are lemur-like critters that reside in grassy areas. They are non-hostile unless attacked by players, they tend to flee from the player unless provoked - when provoked the surrounding pack will also attack
  * Kobolds deal paltry damage and possess low defense, but can be dangerous if many are provoked at once
  * Kobolds can also be encountered in the grass by the entrance to [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep). These however, are hostile towards players, and cause bleed and petrification build-up with their attacks

  

  

###  [Swollen Mongrel](/Swollen+Mongrel)

  

Grotesque, dog-like creatures that will slash and bite the player when they get close enough. They are not, however, very fast, so ranged attacks work well.   
  
_A mutated canine born from the experiments conducted by Lord Aldia. Hunting Dogs are not a naturally-occurring species and are therefore only found in areas to which they were introduced by the Dragon Acolytes. A number of them were dumped into The Gutter over the course of Lord Aldia's research and continue to prowl its depths in search of anything that might serve as a meal_

  

  

###  [Forlorn](/Forlorn)

  

_Born of Aldia's Obsession with the First Sin, the Forlorn lost both their corporeal form and a world to call their own. Now they drift into other worlds, ever in search of a home. But without self, one has neither beginning nor end, and so the Forlorn have only to wander._

  

  

###  [Aslatiel of Mirrah](/Aslatiel+of+Mirrah)

  

_Older brother of Lucatiel of Mirrah. He was known as one of Mirrah's greatest swordsmen but became afflicted by the Undead Curse and set out for Drangleic in search of a cure. He was never heard from again and his fate and whereabouts were unknown - until now…_

  

  

###  [Painting Guardian Phantom](/Painting+Guardian+Phantom)

  

_The ceremonial design suggests that they revered whatever it was they watched over._

  

  

###  [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan)

  

_Born of Aldia's Obsession with the First Sin, the Forlorn lost both their corporeal form and a world to call their own. Now they drift into other worlds, ever in search of a home. But without self, one has neither beginning nor end, and so the Forlorn have only to wander._
