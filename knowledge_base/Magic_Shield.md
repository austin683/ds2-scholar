**Magic Shield** is a [Small Shield](/Small+Shields "Dark Souls 2 Small Shields") in Dark Souls 2. **Small Shields** and Standard Shields can be used not only to block an enemy but to parry their attack as well. This allows a riposte, a free attack by the player for a high amount of damage. Enemy attacks can be interrupted with a parry (pressing the Strong Attack button for the shield) and requires practice to learn the timing.

     _"Small shield used by Leydia apostles.  
Imbued with a special magic that allows spells to be deflected by parrying._

     _The Leydia apostles were inhabitants of the Undead Crypt, but failed to treat death with the proper respect.  
As punishment, they were denied peaceful deaths."_

### DKS2 Magic Shield Acquired From:

  * Dropped by [Leydia Pyromancer](/Leydia+Pyromancer "Dark Souls 2 Leydia Pyromancer") in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt").

### Magic Shield Hints and Tips in Dark Souls 2:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Capable of spell parrying.
  * Infusing a Magic Shield with magic at [McDuff's workshop](/Steady+Hand+McDuff "Dark Souls 2 Steady Hand McDuff") grants 100% magic defense without even a single upgrade, which, combined with its low weight, makes it a very useful secondary shield.
  * However, [Crystal Soul Spear](/Crystal+Soul+Spear "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Soul Spear") can still deal damage even under Magic infusion.
  * Has worse parry frames than most small shields.
