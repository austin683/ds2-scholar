**Tower Shield** is a [Greatshield](/Greatshields "Dark Souls 2 Greatshields") in Dark Souls 2. **Greatshields** can be used not only to block an enemy but allows player to do **shield bash**(Great shields replaced parry ability with heavy shield bash).

     _"A metal greatshield. Very heavy, and requiring great strength to handle, but provides excellent defense._

     _One requires strength to handle a greatshield, but they are very stable. In battle, one fights using shield bash instead of parrying."_

### Acquired From:

  * Found in a chest after the fight with [Old Dragonslayer](/Old+Dragonslayer "Dark Souls 2 Old Dragonslayer") in the [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue"). 

### Tower Shield Hints and Tips:

  * Upgrades with Titanite.
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * A very good starter greatshield for a tank build due to its high physical block and Stability. Likely obtained before most of the other available greatshields.
  * Using a [bonfire ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") at [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue") does not refresh the chest containing this item.
  * This greatshield is visually wielded by enemies in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle").
  * A commonly held belief is that the item descriptions of this shield and the [Greatshield of Glory](/Greatshield+of+Glory "Dark Souls 2 Greatshield of Glory") were erroneously flipped, as the Greatshield of Glory's description reads "_Greatshield of the King's loyal knight Syan. The King commissioned this greatshield specifically for his loyal knight, but Syan met his demise before its completion_ ". The Royal Syan Knights however use this shield instead.
