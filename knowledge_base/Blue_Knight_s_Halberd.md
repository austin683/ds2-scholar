**Blue Knight's Halberd** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**

> _"Halberd of Targray, Knight of the Blue. A fitting weapon for a shepherd of lost souls_  
>  _Those who put faith in an absolute good also believe in the existence of true evil. But to others, the distinction between the two can be quite unclear"._

### **Acquired From**

  * Drops from [Blue Sentinel Targray   
](/Blue+Sentinel+Targray "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinel Targray").
  * Despite some misinformation, it is not given to you by achieving Rank 3 in Blue Sentinels, you must kill Targray to get it.

### **Hints and Tips:**

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite")

  * This weapon reacts EXTREMELY well to elemental infusion, losing only 7 physical damage at +5 for 146 bonus elemental damage, together with a corresponding scaling.
  * As with all Halberds, this weapon deals reduced damage when not hitting the enemy with its blade.
