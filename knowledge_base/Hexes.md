**Hexes** are a type of [Magic](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic") in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. In the original Dark Souls, **Hexes** were only a subset of sorcery colloquially called dark magic. They have been continuously experimented on and have become their own independent form of magic, as **Hexes** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**.   
  
**Hexes** deal dark elemental damage and offer a good balance of offensive spells and self-buffs. They are divided into two categories: [Staff](/Staves "Dark Souls 2 Staves") Hexes and [Chime](/Chimes "Dark Souls 2 Chimes") Hexes, and are unique in that respect. Dark damage scales with the lower of the Intelligence or Faith stat. The soft cap for dark damage is at 30/30 Int/Fth.

### What are Hexes in Dark Souls 2

**Hexes** are a type of Magic that offer offensive and self-buff spells. Hexes are spells that are somehow difficult to incorporate to some builds as it is unique in a way that it would require both Faith and Intelligence in order to be used, as well as having high stat requirements. Most Hexes would also require more than one attunement slot. The damage of Hexes are influenced by dark elemental damage. You will also notice that if a Hex requires more Intelligence than Faith, you would need a Staff to cast that spell, and if it requires more Faith than Intelligence it would require you to equip it on a Chime.

Hexes that are used on Staves tend to deal more damage while the use of Chimes tend to be passive. There are weapons that are neither Staves or Chimes which can also be used to cast Hexes such as the [Mace of the Insolent](/Mace+of+the+Insolent "Dark Souls 2 Mace of the Insolent"). The advantage of having spells from Hexes is that most enemies in the game are not resisntant to Dark Elemental Damage, most are vulnerable to these types of spells, but some of the advantages will slowly fade once you go through the DLCs as most enemies have high elemental resistances.

### Best Hexes in Dark Souls 2

  * [Dark Orb](/Dark+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Dark Orb") \- A basic Hex spell that's essential for a Hex Build. It only requires 1 Attunement slot and has excellent damage for a starting spell, it can also be used 20-30 times, perfect for putting pressure on the opponent, or if you just want to take out multiple enemies from afar without them going anywhere near you.
  * [Dark Weapon](/Dark+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Dark Weapon") \- A spell that buffs a weapon with Dark Damage, the duration scales with Intelligence for 57 sec. at 16 Int, and up to 99 sec. at 24 Int. This is arguably the best weapon buff for dark-infused weapons, do note that the [Resonant Weapon](/Resonant+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Resonant Weapon") does slightly more damage (.05, a negligable amount but more none the less) and should not be overlooked for a hexer that focuses on chime based spells.
  * [Dark Hail](/Dark+Hail "Dark Souls 2 Dark Hail") \- A spell that casts several small dark orbs that shoots in front of you, dealing dark damage to anyone in the way. A single target can be hit by multiple dark orbs if they're close enough, acting like a shotgun. It also works best when you encounter enemies that have larger hitboxes, or when you're having problems with a crowd of enemies.
  * [Affinity](/Affinity "Dark Souls 2 Affinity") \- A spell that casts orbs around you, depending on your Intelligence, it can cast up to 5 orbs above you. It acts as both an offensive and defensive spell. It will automatically lock on and slowly pursue the nearest target.
