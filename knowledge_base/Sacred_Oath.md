### Dark Souls 2 Sacred Oath Acquired From

  * [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis") with the [Soul of Velstadt](/Soul+of+Velstadt "Dark Souls 2 Soul of Velstadt") and 3000 souls.

### Sacred Oath Notes and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Increases physical attack damage by 50, and physical defense by 75 for the caster and nearby allies.
  * Counts as a [Body Buff](/Buffs+&+Debuffs "Dark Souls 2 Buffs & Debuffs") but will strangely persist if cast before applying other Body Buffs.
  * This spell adds the 50 physical attack damage as bonus physical damage on your equipped weapons. Please note that if a weapon has an infusion that reduces the physical damage of the weapon by a percentage (%) (see [Infusion](/Upgrades "Dark Souls 2 Upgrades")), the physical attack bonus provided by this spell is reduced by the same percentage. In addition, [Ring of Blades](/Ring+of+Blades "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Blades") works in the same way and will have its bonus reduced for imbued weaponry as well.
  * Duration is based on faith. It lasts 40 seconds at 10 faith, 45s at 15, 50s at 20, 60s at 25, and 65s at 35+.
  * You cannot have Sacred Oath and [Denial](/Denial "Dark Souls 2 Denial") on at the same time. The Denial icon disappears when you cast Sacred Oath. Tested in the Memory of Jeigh on the Giant Lord.
  * Stacks with blue, orange, and yellow burrs as well as dark, triclops snake and red leech troches.
  * Stacks with [Red Tearstone Ring](/Red+Tearstone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Red Tearstone Ring") (x1.255) and [Brightbug](/Brightbug "Dark Souls 2 Brightbug") (x1.2)
