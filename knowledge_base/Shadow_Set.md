**Shadow Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds).

  
  
  
  
_"Used to hide in the cover of night. Those who are especially adept assassins are often hired as bodyguards._   
_In an attempt to stave off the curse, King Vendrick hired shadowmen to put down the Hollows, but before long they were Hollowed themselves"_

###  Set Location

  * Dropped by [Nimble Shadows](/Nimble+Shadow "Nimble Shadow") in [No Man's Wharf](/No+Man's+Wharf "No Man's Wharf") (NG+ [Flexile Sentry](/Flexile+Sentry "Flexile Sentry") boss fight).
  * [Scholar of the First Sin] Nimble Shadows appear as regular enemies in [No-Man's Wharf](/No-man's+Wharf "No Man's Wharf") (two, next to house at pier exit), [The Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "The Lost Bastille") (one, in the storage with 5 metal chests) and in [Earthen Peak](/Earthen+Peak "Earthen Peak") (one, next to boss exit).

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Titanite").
  * Mask offers the highest poison resistance, as well as second highest dark defense (almost equal to that of [Executioner](/Executioner+Set) helm and [Velstadt's](/Velstadt's+Set) helm).
  * Gauntlets offer second highest poison resistance (almost equal to that of [Northwarder](/Northwarder+Set) gloves and [Tattered Cloth](/Tattered+Cloth+Set) manchettes).
  * Gauntlets require 16 DEX and cause bleeding when used for attacking.
  * The two suspicious shadows NPC that fight alongside Flexile Sentry have noticeably different headgear: one wears the standard shadow headpiece, while the other appears to wear a crooked helmet that has a hawk-like characteristics. The different headgear does not drop as loot, nor is it usable by the player.
  * Mask resembles the one worn by Sealer _Ingward_ from _Dark Souls_ , which is believed to be based on Plague Doctor mask, but without hood. It's also a reference to [plague doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor) mask attributed to [Charles de Lorme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Lorme). The bird-like beak of the mask was often filled with sweet or strong-smelling substances (commonly lavender) to block the smell of plague-stricken corpses.
