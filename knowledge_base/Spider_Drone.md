### Spider Drone Strategy Tips in DKS2

  * These can be parried.
  * One of the best ways to deal with these guys as a melee player is to turtle behind a shield and use the Grand Lance or another poking weapon, in conjunction with the Old Leo Ring for increased poking damage during or just after their attacks. It works very well for taking advantage of their high poise and inconvenient stabbing attacks they do with their legs. Ample opportunity for counterattack damage.
