**Roaming Soul (Forest Guardian)** is an enemy in Dark Souls 2.   

  

  

_Guardian spirits lurking in the thick fog of the central Shaded Woods. Their identites are completely unknown as they barely maintain corporeal forms and are almost invisible against the mist. Are they fallen soldiers of a war long past, or the remnants of a clan that once dwelled in this ancient land?_   
  
Best fought using weapons with a wide arc of attack so that they can be hit easier. Player can not lock-on. Area of effect magic, such as [Firestorm](/Firestorm), is greatly helpful. There are two variants, one with a sword and dagger, and one with a crossbow and dagger. however, they can be marked with the hex [Profound Still](/Profound+Still), if you lure them to the forest entrance.
