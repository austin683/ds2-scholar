###  **Acquired From**

  * Dropped by Rogue enemies in [Huntsman's Copse ](/Huntsman%27s+Copse "Dark Souls 2 Huntsman%27s Copse")

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Has similiar damage output of a [Bandit's Knife](/Bandit%27s+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Bandit%27s Knife") but it has no bleed build up, having the same weight as default [Dagger](/Dagger "Dark Souls 2 Dagger").
  * Having almost no scaling, applying elemental infusions, such as Lightning, make it a good low requirement weapon.
