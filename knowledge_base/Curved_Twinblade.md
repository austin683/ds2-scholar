**Curved Twinblade** is a [weapon](/Weapons "weapon") in **Dark Souls 2.**

  
  
_"A twinblade imported from a foreign land. The razor-sharp blades cause bleeding, but as a result, are easily worn and dulled. When wielded by a master, this dual-tipped blade is an unparalleled weapon that hardly allows a foe any opportunity to retaliate..."_   
_More description"_

###  **Acquired From**

  * Covenant of Blood Rank 1 : 50 rank points.
  * Obtained from Chancellor Wellager in Drangleic Castle in NG++ for 10,000 Souls. (Not purchasable using bonfire ascetics; Chancellor Wellager NG++ items can only be obtained by progressing the game to NG++).

###  **Hints and Tips**

  * Basically a Dex dedicated version of [Stone Twinblade](/Stone+Twinblade) if you don't infuse it, this one however has slightly higher durability and the default Bleed auxiliary.
  * Unique to twinblade type weapons, Curved Twinblade inflicts Bleed build up, however, not as high as other Bleed weapons for singular hit due to balance issue because it's a twinblade.
  * If you have no regard to Dex scaling, you may infuse it with Bleed to boost up the Bleed buildup, paired with [Shadow Gauntlet](/Shadow+Set), [Crest of Blood](/Crest+of+Blood) and even [Bleeding Serum](/Bleeding+Serum), this will make it good on inflicting Bleed.
  * Alternately, Infusing with Poison will inflict Poison build up with a fire rate on par with [Twinblade](/Twinblade) and [Channeler's Trident](/Channeler%27s+Trident) with an additional small amount of Bleed build up.
  * As other twinblades, this weapon will benefit a lot from the use of [Stone ring](/Stone+ring). (tested on Syan knights and Loyce knights).
