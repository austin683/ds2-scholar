**Mad Warrior** is an [enemy](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") dark spirit that can be encountered in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki").

_King Vendrick called upon powers from beyond his borders in an attempt to stave off the curse._

_The katana of a berserker, by its name. The thick, shiny black blade cuts exquisitely. Its origins and owner are unknown, but at some point the blade became known by this name._

### Mad Warrior Location

  * [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol"), must be a member of the [Bell Keepers](/Bell+Keepers "Dark Souls 2 Bell Keepers") [Covenant](/Covenants "Dark Souls 2 Covenants"), after which he has a low chance of spawning (20%).

### Mad Warrior Drops

  * [Mad Warrior Set](/Mad+Warrior+Set "Dark Souls 2 Mad Warrior Set") (very rare drop)
  * [Berserker Blade](/Berserker+Blade "Dark Souls 2 Berserker Blade") (very rare drop)
  * 1,000 [Souls](/Souls "Dark Souls 2 Souls") in NG, 2,000 [Souls](/Souls "Dark Souls 2 Souls") in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus").

### Mad Warrior Notes & Tips

  * His spawn rate is unaffected by the [Delicate String](/Delicate+String "Dark Souls 2 Delicate String") ring or [Dried Fingers](/Dried+Fingers "Dark Souls 2 Dried Fingers") item.
  * Killing him contributes to the [Bell Keepers](/Bell+Keepers "Dark Souls 2 Bell Keepers") covenant ranking.
  * He will drink an [Estus Flask](/Estus+Flask "Dark Souls 2 Estus Flask") at low health.
  * [Item Discovery](/Item+Discovery "Dark Souls 2 Item Discovery") boosting items such as the [Covetous Gold Serpent Ring](/Covetous+Gold+Serpent+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Gold Serpent Ring") and [Symbol of Avarice](/Symbol+of+Avarice "Dark Souls 2 Symbol of Avarice") help with the low drop chance of his armor and swords, but do not affect his spawn rate.
  * Casting the spell [Unveil](/Unveil "Dark Souls 2 Unveil") (after all other enemies have been cleared) can be a quick way to tell if he has spawned or not.
  * Another possible method includes running offline in windowed mode and opening the Windows Task Manager to the side so you can see the games process memory value, then observing if the memory increases when entering [Belfry Sol](/Belfry+Sol "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Sol").
  * On PS3, you can hear the laser in the PS3 move twice. The trick is to keep resting until you hear two slower movements after the first two. These two extra laser movements are indicating that the Mad Warrior has spawned.
  * More Mad Warrior enemies can be encountered in the [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King") DLC.
