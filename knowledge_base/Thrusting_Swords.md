**Thrusting Swords** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a type of [Weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") that mainly focuses their attack with thrusts, capable for getting through heavy armor or scales of the opponent. The Thrusting Swords' attack motion allows rapid attacks in quick succession, their running attack performs a lunge which allows users to gain a farther reach compared to other swords. While their thrusting attacks are very effective against armor, the impact area of the attacks is small which means it can easily be evaded. Thrusting Swords are best used when trying to interrupt an opponent before they begin their attack. Some Thrusting Swords also deal high critical damage, as well as Backstab and [Riposte](/Riposte "Dark Souls 2 Riposte"). You can also use Thrusting Swords simultaneously while guarding with a [Shield](/Shields "Dark Souls 2 Shields"). They also have a unique animation that completely replaces the kick attack where the user makes a horizontal swiping combo while doing a backstep. Thrusting Swords can also be used to parry when equipped on the left hand. This page covers a list of all Thrusting Swords in Dark Souls 2.
