### The Cathedral Walkthrough

### Just Stopping By

Open the door and light the **bonfire** , then proceed up the stairs and follow the red carpet. At the end pick the option "talk" and when asked if you will help, select "Yes". This will open a new path that will lead to the final boss; many areas, chests, & items blocked by ice in [Frozen Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Eleum Loyce") will also melt.

Before you go down and fight the boss it is recommended to find and recruit the three missing Eleum Loyce Knights to assist you. After finding the Knights, continue through the Cathedral and drop down to [The Old Chaos](/The+Old+Chaos "Dark Souls 2 The Old Chaos").
