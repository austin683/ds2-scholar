## **Dragon Shrine**

  
**Dragon Shrine** is a [Location](/Locations "Dark Souls 2 Locations") in **Dark Souls 2**. The Dragon Shrine is home to the [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon"), and a gauntlet of powerful enemies including many [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight"). It is recommended to bring many healing items and equip weapons that can stagger enemies or afflict poison/bleed on them. After meeting the Ancient Dragon, the player will receive the Ashen Mist Heart which allows them to access the [Memories of the Ancients](/Memories+of+the+Ancients "Dark Souls 2 Memories of the Ancients") to unlock the [Giant's Kinship](/Giant%27s+Kinship "Dark Souls 2 Giant%27s Kinship") and face the final boss at the Throne of Want or unlock additional [Souls of Giants](/soul+of+a+giant "Dark Souls 2 soul of a giant") which weaken [King Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") defenses significantly.

### Dragon Shrine Walkthrough

### Friendly Locals

After arriving from the [Dragon Aerie](/Dragon+Aerie "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Aerie") through the bridge, there is a bonfire in a small building left of the stairs. Interact with it to recieve a surprise visit from the [Scholar of the First Sin](/Scholar+of+the+First+Sin "Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin"). When he finishes with his dialogue, he will disappear and make the bonfire available for activation.

Head up the stairs and you will face a [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper"). The [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight") in this area will be non-hostile, even going as far as performing gestures, unless the player has joined the [Dragon Remnants Covenant](/Dragon+Remnants "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Remnants") or you flee from a battle against the [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper"). Note that having a [white phantom](/Phantoms "Dark Souls 2 Phantoms") present in your world will also trigger the Dragon Knights to become hostile on sight. Behind them, in the arches under the upcoming stairs, is a [Pharros' Contraption](/Pharros%27+Contraption "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Contraption") which reveals an illusory wall on the left. Inside is a metal chest with the [Judgement Set](/Judgment+Set "Dark Souls 2 Judgment Set"). Take a right just before the stairs and go through the doorway to find a metal chest with 3x [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic").

Having looted it, continue up the aforementioned stairs -passing another passive [Dragon Knight](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight")\- and you will find a [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper") ready to attack. Not only is there the added pressure of two [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight") watching, this [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper") also wields a two-handed mace which makes this fight trickier than the sword-wielding one earlier. This enemy has a relentless flurry attack and is only open to larger attacks after he swings his mace overhead and smashes it into the ground.

  * Melee - Try to keep still and lure him into such an attack. 
    * Alternatively, fight him from below on the stairs and most of his attacks will swing over you.
  * Ranged - Lure him back to the stairs you came up and safely snipe him from there.

Continuing through the arches guarded by the two [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight"), and up the first flight of stairs will be a chest containing a [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). There will be another set of stairs to climb into a gazebo-esque structure with two [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight") and a [Faintstone](/Faintstone "Dark Souls 2 Faintstone"). Jump across through the opening in the railing to the next platform to find a metal chest on the right, with a [Drakekeeper's Greataxe](/Drakekeeper's+Greataxe "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper's Greataxe") and [Drakekeeper's Greatshield](/Drakekeeper's+Greatshield "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper's Greatshield").

### Egg Hunt

Drop down to the stairs below and head up to find another [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper") with a sword, and another two [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight"). After he's dealt with, head left of the stairs to drop down into a lower level and find a chest containing a [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite slab"). On the left, before going under the stairs and through the doorway, there is a summon sign for [Bashful Ray](/Bashful+Ray "Dark Souls 2 Bashful Ray"), but be careful, as with the white Phantoms, this will make the [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight") be hostile towards you as long as he is around. If you don't intend to fight the [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight"), you can simly banish Ray again with the [Black Separation Crystal](/Black+Separation+Crystal "Dark Souls 2 Black Separation Crystal"). Proceed through the doorway to find another [Drakeeper](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper") -wielding a greathammer and greatshield- and a [Dragon Knight](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight"). To the right of the [Knight](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight") is a corpse holding a [Skeptic's Spice](/Skeptic's+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic's Spice") and [Twilight Herb](/Twilight+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Twilight Herb").

Going through the door, inside is a metal chest containing [Third Dragon Ring](/Third+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Third Dragon Ring"), that triggers the invasion of [Dragonfang Villard](/Dragonfang+Villard "Dark Souls 2 Dragonfang Villard") upon opening, and a long staircase up. He actually spawns upstairs at the shrine and will wait for you there. Once defeated, feel free to take the [Petrified Egg ](/Petrified+Egg "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Egg") from the shrine here. This item is used to join the [Dragon Remnants](/Dragon+Remnants "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Remnants") later, after you give it to [Magerold of Lanafir](/Magerold+of+Lanafir "Dark Souls 2 Magerold of Lanafir") at [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep").

### Route to the Ancient Dragon

Now head to the edge at the right side to find another metal chest containing a [Petrified Something](/Petrified+Something "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Something"), then drop down once again onto the ledge below for another metal chest containing the [Crystal Magic Weapon](/Crystal+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Magic Weapon") spell, and a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore"). Drop down one final time to arrive at the landing you initially dropped off to find the chest with the [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab").

Opening the wooden door and another wooden door will lead to a massive staircase leading up. You'll immediately notice the rows of [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight") lined up on either side of the staircase, and may be intimidated. Don't worry, as the same rules apply as all the others, and will not attack you unless provoked.

That being said, out of the total 9 on the stairs, the one at the top in the middle is the only one that will aggro automatically. This enemy does not respawn, and killing him will prevent the other Dragon Knights from attacking the player even if they run past the Drakekeepers or summon a co-op phantom.

Defeat him then proceed past the eight on the stairs, and the three in the subsequent corridor. Through here, you'll come out onto a large open platform with the [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon") waiting for you. Talking to the ancient one will award you with the [Ashen Mist Heart](/Ashen+Mist+Heart "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Mist Heart"). This can be used to access the various Memories by interacting with overgrown bodys of the Giants in **[Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants") (progress), [Brightstone Cove Tseldora](/Brightstone+Cove+Tseldora "Dark Souls 2 Brightstone Cove Tseldora"), ****[Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt") (DLC Memory) and [Iron passage](/Iron+passage "Dark Souls 2 Iron passage") (DLC Memory).   
**(Interacting with the Ancient Dragon could also be what pacifies the Dragon Knights, more testing is needed.)

You can also choose to fight him or not, but there's no real need to.

BOSS FIGHT: [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon")

### Enemy Strategies

#### 

#### Drakekeepers

  * These enemies hit hard, and some of them are relatively fast for their size.
  * They are vulnerable to bludgeoning attacks, and weapons such as the Large Club or Great Club devastate them. With a strength of around 40 and a fully upgraded weapon, expect them to drop after 2 or 3 hits. If you are using such weapons, it's recommended to use hit and run tactics in order to avoid their often devastating attacks.
  * They are vulnerable to fire. An effective tactic is to simply circle around them to the right and hit them in the back 1-2 times, bait their combo, then repeat.
  * They are also vulnerable to lightning. Their slow movement means hanging back and throwing lightning spears is very effective.
  * For the swordsman, he will do a downward strike or sweep both ways, and the maceman will slash twice in either direction.
  * Block his sword attacks if you have a shield and he will be easy to kill, as he leaves a window after his attacks to land a hit with a weapon or a spell. 

#### Dragon Knight

  * These guys are fast, but they are easily stun-locked, even with weapons that deal medium poise damage such as a [Claymore](/Claymore "Dark Souls 2 Claymore").
  * Use pyromancy on them for high amounts of damage.
  * Beware they have a shield smash skill if you decide to block all their combo.

Head up the stairs and you will face a [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper"). Behind him, in the arches under the upcoming stairs, are a pile of boxes hiding a [Pharros' Contraption](/Pharros%27+Contraption "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Contraption") which reveals an illusory wall on the left. Inside is a metal chest with the [Judgement Set](/Judgment+Set "Dark Souls 2 Judgment Set") and the [Staff of Wisdom](/Staff+of+Wisdom "Dark Souls 2 Staff of Wisdom").

### Egg Hunt

Drop down to the stairs below and head up to find another two [Drakekeepers](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper"). After they have been dealt, head left of the stairs to drop down into a lower level and find a chest containing a [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite slab"), and a [Mimic](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic") on the right that drops the [Washing Pole](/Washing+Pole "Dark Souls 2 Washing Pole") and a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") when killed.

Proceed through the doorway to find [Drakekeeper](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper") -wielding a Great hammer and Greatshield, with a corpse holding [Skeptic's Spice](/Skeptic's+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Skeptic's Spice") and [Twilight Herb](/Twilight+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Twilight Herb"), in a small recess on the left of the room.

Going through the door, inside is a metal chest containing [Third Dragon Ring](/Third+Dragon+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Third Dragon Ring"), that triggers the invasion of [Dragonfang Villard](/Dragonfang+Villard "Dark Souls 2 Dragonfang Villard") upon opening, and a long staircase up. While the invasion is in motion, he actually spawns upstairs at the shrine and will wait for you there. Once defeated, feel free to take the [Petrified Egg ](/Petrified+Egg "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Egg") from the shrine here; this item is use to join the [Dragon Remnants](/Dragon+Remnants "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Remnants") later, after you give it to [Magerold of Lanafir](/Magerold+of+Lanafir "Dark Souls 2 Magerold of Lanafir") at [Iron Keep](/Iron+Keep "Dark Souls 2 Iron Keep").

Now head to the edge at the right side to find another metal chest containing a [Watchdragon Parma](/Watchdragon+Parma "Dark Souls 2 Watchdragon Parma") shield, then drop down once again onto the ledge below for another metal chest containing the [Crystal Magic Weapon](/Crystal+Magic+Weapon "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Magic Weapon") spell. Drop down one final time to arrive at the landing you initially dropped off to find the chest with the [Titanite Slab](/Titanite+Slab "Dark Souls 2 Titanite Slab").

Opening the wooden door and another wooden door will lead to a massive staircase leading up. Heading up will bring you initially to a pair of [Drakekeepers](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper"). Beyond them, but already within your line of sight, are two [Dragon Knights](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight"). These enemies are very fast and extremely though, and are very hard to deal with in pairs -try to lure one at a time, and avoid fighting the [Drakekeepers](/Drakekeeper "Dark Souls 2 Drakekeeper") any higher on the stairs.

That being said, once you defeat all four, it's not over. You have one more [Dragon Knight](/Dragon+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Knight") to deal with before you can cross this corridor to come out onto a large open platform with the [Ancient Dragon](/Ancient+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Ancient Dragon") waiting for you. Talking to the ancient one will award you with the [Ashen Mist Heart](/Ashen+Mist+Heart "Dark Souls 2 Ashen Mist Heart"). Remember all of the strange tree-giant hybrids that are laying around in various places? Now you can finally interact with them.

You can also choose to fight him or not, but there's no real need to.

  * They are faster if not meaner than they ever have been but they actually have low poise as they can easily be stun lock by heavy weapon even 2 hits from normal greatsword, such as a [Claymore](/Claymore "Dark Souls 2 Claymore").
  * Use pyromancy on them for high amounts of damage.
  * Beware they have a shield smash skill just like us if you decide to block all their combo.
