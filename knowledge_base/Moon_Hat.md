_"Astrologists believe that magical powers can be obtained at moments of special heavenly alignment._   
_Even the collective wisdom of the Melfian Magic Academy cannot pull magic out of the sky, but the ideas of the astrologists led to the creation of new and very useful magic devices."_

### Location

  * Sold by [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan) in [Aldia's Keep](/Aldia%27s+Keep) after fufilling his questline while hollow.
  * Dropped by [Astrologist](/Astrologist) in [Iron Passage](/Iron+Passage) (with the exception of the [hood](/Black+Hollow+Mage+Set)).

### Notes

  * Upgraded with [Titanite](/Titanite+Shard)
  * The**Moon Hat** increases**[Intelligence](/Intelligence) +2**
  * Rumours - 
    * Said to increase luck.
    * Watchdragon parma shield's "luck" might stack with this.
  * Many armor sets do not inquire about other stat increases like being able to increase health(kings crown) or endurance (Velstadts helm) when they certainly do. Luck or "great fortune"(watchdragon parma) might be described as item discovery + chance that the player may deflect a small certain amount of damage percentage.
