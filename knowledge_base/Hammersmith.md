### Hammersmith (Undead Steelworker) Information in Dark Souls 2

_"These brutish characters may have once worked for the Iron King in the construction of the many weapons and armors that he required, but now they are as Hollowed as the Laborers who slave away in the mines. There is a difference, however: strength. The Steelworkers heft huge hammers whereas the common laborers merely flail about with their arms.__"_

### Hammersmith (Undead Steelworker) Strategy Tips in DS2

  * These guys are very lacking in health, simply focus all your attacks on 'em and finish the fight as soon as possible. Watch out though, as their hammer smash down attack will do immense damage to any armour and break your shield's poise.
  * One good strategy to use on the ones at the start of Earthen Peak is to have them walk through the poison urns on the upper pathway you came in through. It certainly takes a while to start damaging them, but if they break any of the urns, you can just wait at a safe distance for their health to suddenly start dropping. They die within seconds, leaving you free to go through the fog door.
