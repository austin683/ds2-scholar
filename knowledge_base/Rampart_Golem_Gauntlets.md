Rampart Golem Gauntlets Description

_"Gauntlets of the rampart golems, granted life by the Ivory King._  
_The golems were charged with the containment of the creatures of chaos whithin the boundaries of the wall._  
_When the doors of Eleum Loyce were flung open, the place turned frigid and lifeless, but the golems remained dutifully on guard."_

###   
  
Where to Find \ Location

  * Dropped by [Rampart Golems](/Rampart+Golem "Dark Souls 2 Rampart Golem") in [Frozen Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Eleum Loyce") (also encountered in [Frigid Outskirts](/Frigid+Outskirts "Dark Souls 2 Frigid Outskirts") as dark spirits on NG+2).
