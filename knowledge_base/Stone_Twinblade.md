Weapon Type: Twinblade

Attack Type: Slash/Thrust

Enchantable: Yes

Special: No

*When infused: 126 physical dmg/126 elemental dmg and B scaling with chosen element. Str scaling changes to B. Dex scaling changes to E. 

**Stone Twinblade** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2.**

  
_"Twinblade of the castle stone soldiers._   
_Sir Velstadt could always be found at the King's side, and followed him when he fled. The knights in his service waited patiently for his return, but turned to stone before he did."_

###  **Acquired From**

  * The Stone Soldiers wielding these weapons can be found before the Looking Glass Knight boss. It's a rare drop.
  * The black phantom wearing the Aurous Set in No Man´s Wharf. NG+ only.

###  **Hints and Tips:**

  * Must wait until the twinblade stone soldiers actually stand up (and are targetable) to kill them, otherwise they will not drop this twinblade. You have to wait until their eyes glow red, then you can start hitting them. Note: the stone soldiers don't drop souls either if you kill them before their eyes glow red, nor any of their any item drops.
  * It has the best strength scaling among all the twinblades (while [Curved Twinblade](/Curved+Twinblade "Dark Souls 2 Curved Twinblade") is Dex dedicated), yet it also has the lowest durability among the twinblade group.
  * [Stone Soldier](/Stone+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Stone Soldier") drains its durability really quick.
  * Extremely useful against [Sanctum Soldiers](/Sanctum+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Soldier") and [Sanctum Priestess](/Sanctum+Priestess "Dark Souls 2 Sanctum Priestess") because it can stagger them really quick
