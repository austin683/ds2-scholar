Gaolers are enemies in Dark Souls II. They are first encountered on a wooden watchtower beyond the [Exile Holding Cells](/Exile+Holding+Cells) bonfire.   
  
_The Undead Jailers of the Lost Bastille carry primitive weapons intended to instill fear and can even use pyromancy to burn escapees, and intruders, to a crisp. The Jailers are wrapped in bandages. What lies beneath? Have they been burned by their own flames, or are they hiding a darker secret?_   
  

  * Gaolers are prison wardens of the [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille). They wield great, brutish machetes to evoke fear in prisoners who dare to escape 
  * Gaolers have adequate amounts of HP, move fairly quickly, and deal significant damage. Their polearms give their attacks great range
  * Gaolers tend to poke players at long range, sweep at close range, and attempt to grab and chase players at close to medium range
  * Gaolers have great reach with their weapons, but their attacks and turning speed are sluggish. They can also be staggered by consecutive attacks
