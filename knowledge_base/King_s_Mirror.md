### King's Mirror Hints and Tips in Dark Souls 2

  * Upgraded with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone").
  * Can be buffed with [spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic").
  * Since the spell parry times were buffed, the spell parry frames for this shield are now the highest of any. Essentially, the parry frames last from the time the shield is brought up to it slamming down. ( Tested with Crystal Souls Spear, Dark Orb and Hail, Climax, Soul Spear Barrage, and various pyromancies)
  * Note that spells are only getting reflected while parrying, simply raising the shield will not reflect spells.
