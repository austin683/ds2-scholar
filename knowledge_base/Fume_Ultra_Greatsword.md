###  DS2 Fume Ultra Greatsword Hints and Tips 

  * Reinforced with [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone") to +5.
  * Neither resins nor spells can buff this weapon.
  * Will perform a brief block then counter attack with either L2 while two-handing or R2 while one-handing. The block lingers longer than the animation indicates.
  * Since it is a block, if timed well, a guard break can stop your attack and get you stunned.
  * Coupling the ability to block an attack while attacking, and having high poise, will allow you to absorb two hits from your opponent without disrupting the attack animation. This can be very useful in PvP.
  * Because of its high stability and reasonable durability along with decent reductions except for magic, this sword's guard is superior to most weapons.
  * The weakness of this sword would be the lack of horizontal swing, only one handed R1 second swing and two handed R2 second swing. Recommended to pair a straight sword as sidearm.

### DS2 Fume Ultra Greatsword Trivia:

  * It loosely resembles a molten [Dragon Bone Smasher](https://demonssouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragon+Bone+Smasher "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Bone Smasher") from _Demon's Souls_ , with a damaged hilt.
  * Appears in the sequel  _Dark Souls 3_ as the [Fume Ultra Greatsword](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Fume+Ultra+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Fume Ultra Greatsword") _._
