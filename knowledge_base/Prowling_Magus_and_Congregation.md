### Prowling Magus and Congregation Strategy in DKS2

The fight's difficulty comes from the large number of enemies in the room. Each individual enemy, however, is weak.   
The clerics seem to throw their lightning bolts faster than the sorcerer seems to cast his spells on the player. Since the clerics also cast healing spells on the other enemies in the room, killing them should be a priority.   
One strategy is to use a melee weapon with wide swings to hit/stagger multiple foes at once. Alternatively, some Pyromancy spells with large areas of effect, such as Flame Swathe and Firestorm, can end this fight in seconds.   
Another possible strategy is to use Holy Water Urns, which you can buy in unlimited quantities from [Blue Sentinel Targray](/Blue+Sentinel+Targray "Dark Souls 2 Blue Sentinel Targray") in the [Cathedral of Blue](/Cathedral+of+Blue "Dark Souls 2 Cathedral of Blue"). You need roughly 10 to deal with this fight (NG).   
Note: The Halberd's two-handed strong attack (the whirlwind-like attack) is very good for this fight. Running into the group and performing the strong attack with a decent melee build will nearly kill the Magus (over 50%+ of his health) and deal considerable amounts of damage to the rest of the congregation. (Needs Confirmation.)   
  
**Melee**   
This fight can prove difficult if you allow the congregation hollows to corner you but it can be quite easy if you circle around the room and take out the hollows first, the Magus himself is rather slow and his attacks are easy to dodge from range, the clerics on the otherhand may prove a bit more difficult due to their lightning spear miracle but these can be blocked with a decent shield or you can simply roll out of the way of them. Once the congregation hollows have been handled with its time to take out the Magus and the clerics the Magus is very quick to fall and will leave you with the two clerics who will not prove a challenge up close or vice versa.   
  
**Profound Still**   
If you are able to use profound still this fight is VERY easy as it blocks the 3 main threats in this fight, the casters. Use [Profound Still](/Profound+Still "Dark Souls 2 Profound Still") just before entering the room and prioritize the hollows. Refresh Profound Still before it runs out and the fight is won in no time.

### Dark Souls 2 Prowling Magus and Congregation Hints:

  * Take out the two casters first and then the Congregation. The Magus uses a dark orb spell and a proximity spell, which are easily avoidable. The magus is easily dispatched once you are able to land hits on him uninterrupted by other enemies.
  * If you have sufficient faith, the spell Soul Appease is great to use against this boss.
  * The benches can be used to stop the crawling zombies. They are also high enough to block the lightning attacks by the clerics, and can therefore act as a useful buffer if you need to heal.
  * The Bosses themselves seem to be able to be backstabbed.
  * The Bosses are modeled after Fools Idol from _Demon's Souls_
  * The Magus is initially [Aldia Warlock](/Aldia+Warlock "Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock"), he wears [Warlock Mask](/Warlock+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Warlock Mask") which doesn't drop here.
  * Be careful not to roll into vases in the corner since water contained in them will make you wet. Wet condition drastically increase damage taken from clerics bolts.
