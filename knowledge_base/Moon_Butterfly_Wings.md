_"Wings made from wings of the rare moon butterfly. Poisons those who approach its wearer."_

_"Also extends jump distance._ "

_"Little is known about the moon butterfly, which only appears on full-moon nights in winter. Some say the butterfly is a magical being, and its larvae have never once been spotted."_

### Location

  * [Maughlin the Armorer](/Maughlin+the+Armourer), in [Majula](/Majula). 
    * Only available in NG+ & the hat requires NG++ (bonfire intensity 3) after spending 16000+ souls with him.
    * In other words, you need to burn two Bonfire Ascetics in Majula to get the entire set.

### Notes

  * Part of the [Moon Butterfly Set](/Moon+Butterfly+Set "Moon Butterfly Set").  

    * Poisons nearby foes.
    * Each piece has a special effect (Effect(All): Poison nearby foes, Effect(Wings/Skirt): Increases length of jumping)
  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Upgrades#Ore).
  * When wearing the wings or the skirt you can jump without having to be sprinting first. 
    * It is still possible to roll in the opposite direction, and it is possible to backstep. This may save you in PVP.
    * Rolling to the side is possible, but very difficult. More often than not, you'll leap. (You can change the settings to have L3 jump instead of B/Circle)
  * It is possible to immediately and consistently sprint and roll while wearing the wings without jumping simply by tapping forward before pressing the roll button.
  * This will not prevent you from dying from falls that would normally kill you.
