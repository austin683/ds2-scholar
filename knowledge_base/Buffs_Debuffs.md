**Buffs & Debuffs** in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki") are categories of [Status Effects](/Status+Effects "Dark Souls 2 Status Effects"). This page covers how **Buffs & Debuffs** stack, the potency of their effects, and their stat requirements.

The tables provided below do not provide an exhaustive list of every status effect in the game, only those that fall into exclusive categories and are prone to being overwritten.

### Stacking Buffs & Debuffs in Dark Souls 2

[Spells](/Magic "Dark Souls 2 Magic") require the right catalyst to be cast, and the [Lingering Dragoncrest Ring](/Lingering+Dragoncrest+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Lingering Dragoncrest Ring") variants increase the duration of most spell buffs by 15%/25%/40%. (Also boosted by the [Northwarder Set](/Northwarder+Set "Dark Souls 2 Northwarder Set")).

Armament buffs can be applied regardless of which hand the armament is in, but armament buffs are lost when the armament is swapped out.

Buffs often stack multiplicatively (i.e. [Red Tearstone Ring](/Red+Tearstone+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Red Tearstone Ring") (+20% physical damage) and [Brightbug](/Brightbug "Dark Souls 2 Brightbug") (+20% damage) would result in +44% physical damage).

[Homeward](/Homeward "Dark Souls 2 Homeward"), [Homeward Bone](/Homeward+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Homeward Bone"), [Aged Feather](/Aged+Feather "Dark Souls 2 Aged Feather"), or the [Darksign](/Darksign "Dark Souls 2 Darksign") will remove Temporary Buffs when used.

**Temporary Buffs** fall into select categories, **only one of each can be active at a time** :

  * Weapon
  * Body
  * Footstep

**Unique Temporary****Buffs & Debuffs can be freely stacked**.

### Weapon Buffs

**Weapon Buffs** improve the offensive capability of a weapon, often adding attack power or status buildup.  
Weapon Buffs from [consumables](/Consumables "Dark Souls 2 Consumables") cannot be applied to weapons with elemental [infusions](/Infusion+Paths "Dark Souls 2 Infusion Paths"). [Shields](/Shields "Dark Souls 2 Shields"), [Bows](/Bows "Dark Souls 2 Bows"), [Crossbows](/Crossbows "Dark Souls 2 Crossbows"), [Greatbows](/Greatbows "Dark Souls 2 Greatbows"), and spell catalysts also cannot be weapon buffed.
