**Agape Ring** is a [Ring](/Rings "Dark Souls 2 Rings") in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")****(DKS2)**. Players can equip up to 4 Rings, but equipping two of the same item is not possible. Some rings have upgraded versions, having a maximum of +3. Some can only be found in [NG+](/New+Game+Plus "Dark Souls 2 New Game Plus"). Rings can be repaired at a blacksmith, but not upgraded. Upgraded versions must be acquired throughout the game from corpses, chests, bosses, etc.

> A ring affixed with an open vessel. The vessel insatiably absorbs souls in place of its wearer, who is left unaware even of their collection. All things are rooted in souls, but what drives our thirst for them? Abstinence from this elixir may be the truest homage to an enduring self"

### Notes

  * From [Patch 1.10](/Patch+1.10 "Dark Souls 2 Patch 1.10"): _"When players equip the new Agape Ring, souls collected from kills during online play will be absorbed by the ring rather than the player. This allows players to control their online matchmaking experience by limiting their total souls collected."_
  * _**ALL** souls obtained, online **AND** offline, including NPC enemies during player vs. environment, are absorbed by the ring with the exception of souls from bloodstains._
  * _You cannot use soul items as consumables while wearing the Agape Ring._
  * _You also can't sell anything to Gavlan while wearing this thing._
  * _Cannot be traded_
  * This is the only item in the game in any language to have missing text. The LatinAmerica Spanish version displays the name as [no text].
