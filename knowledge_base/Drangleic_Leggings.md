### Drangleic Leggings Description

_Drummond's ancestors have served Drangleic for generations, principally as defenders of the great fort, but Captain Drummond is the last in this proud line."_

### Where to Find \ Location

  * The Drangleic Set (without Helm) can be found after you defeat the [Pursuer](/Pursuer). Walk past the area you fought him in and you will see a hole in the ground. Dropping into the hole will reveal a corpse, which will include the Drangleic Set as well as a greatsword and shield.
  * You'll find [Captain Drummond](/Captain+Drummond) in the very beginning of the [Memory of Vammar](/Memory+of+Vammar), which can be accessed via the withered Giant tree in courtyard area of the [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants)after you have the Ashen Mist Heart, behind the King's Door. He will reward you with the [Drangleic Helm](/Drangleic+Helm) upon defeating the Giant Lord in the [Memory of Jeigh](/Memory+of+Jeigh). You do not have to summon Drummond for the fight and the Giant Lord can be defeated before speaking with Captain Drummond.
