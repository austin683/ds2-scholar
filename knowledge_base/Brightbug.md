### Brightbug Usage in DKS2

  * 20% increase in damage done and 20% decrease in damage received. 
  * The duration of the effect is 120 seconds, not affected by the Lingering Dragoncrest Ring.
  * Counts as a [Body Buff](/Buffs+&+Debuffs "Dark Souls 2 Buffs & Debuffs"), and so cancels previously applied body buffs (Sacred Oath, Denial) and vice versa.
  * In SotFS Brightbug does cancel ([Denial](/Denial "Dark Souls 2 Denial"), [Unleash Magic](/Unleash+magic "Dark Souls 2 Unleash magic"), [Numbness](/Numbness "Dark Souls 2 Numbness"), [Resonant Flesh](/Resonant+flesh "Dark Souls 2 Resonant flesh")) but does not cancel ([Sacred Oath](/Sacred+Oath "Dark Souls 2 Sacred Oath")) though Sacred Oath does cancel Brightbug. meaning that Sacred Oath needs to be used first for them to stack.
  * Cannot be used if a phantom is present, even as a host.
