**Crystal Lizards** are special **[Creatures](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies")** in **[Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")**. These can also filed under **[Secrets](/Secrets "Dark Souls 2 Secrets")** since they are a special type of non-hostile creature that will be beneficial for players to encounter. These lizards can be encountered as specific Locations throughout Dark Souls 2 and are most notable for their [Item](/Items "Dark Souls 2 Items") drops. Clear them before their escape to obtain a set type of upgrade materials. These drops are set according to the Crystal Lizard at the specific location and are not randomized. Once cleared, they do not respawn. Below is a list of known Crystal Lizard [Locations](/Locations "Dark Souls 2 Locations") and the rewards for clearing them. [Enemies](/Enemies "Dark Souls 2 Enemies") have their own behavior and unique attacks, killing enemies provide various drops that reward players with items and souls. 

> A timid species of sparkling reptile cloaked in total mystery. These strange creatures possess a variety of useful, and valuable, stones. These creatures are not well understood, as the procurement of specimens for study is an all-but-futile endeavor; Crystal Lizards are masters of escape and have a marked tendency to do so before anyone can get close enough to catch them.

### Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard Information 

Crystal Lizards are non-respawning enemies which flee when approached by players. When a lizard is nearby, players can hear a distinct jingle sound that resembles shaking a bag full of gems or coins. When killed, lizards drop weapon upgrade items such as Titanite and stones for weapon reinforcement and infusion.

If approached, the lizard will scurry away and disappear after about 6 seconds if no damage is taken. If the lizard escapes, resting at a bonfire will respawn it. Lizards do not respawn if killed. If a player kills a lizard but dies without collecting the dropped items, they will disappear.

### Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard Strategy Tips

  * Once approached, the Crystal Lizard will skitter away, even off ledges. The lizards' small statures makes it difficult to hit them using weapons that don't strike downwards. Sniping them using magic or powerful bows that can one-shot them is usually the easiest way to kill them.

### Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard Notes, Tips & Tricks 

  * Note that the items they drop can fall off ledges and therefore be lost permanently. If it's scurrying against a ledge of some kind, just let it go and reset the encounter rather than risk losing the drops for good.
