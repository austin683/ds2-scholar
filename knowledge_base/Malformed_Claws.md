**Malformed Claws** are **[Claw Weapons](/Fist+Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Fist Weapons") **and one of the available **[Weapons](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in [Dark Souls 2](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki"). Malformed Claws **are particularly useful for dual-wielding and power stance, and it's recommended to apply Poison for added effectiveness. While not as potent as the Channeler's Trident, the Malformed Claws stand out as the best fist weapon for inflicting Poison.

> One of the malformed weapons developed in Aldia. Appears to be a crustacean pincer, but its precise origins are unclear.   
>   
> Use strong attack to inflict damage even upon foes with

>  The peculiar figure known as Lord Aldia attempted to uncover the secrets of life itself, and viewed the Undead as a key to this mystery

### How to get Malformed Claws in Dark Souls 2

  * Chance to drop from [Suspicious Shadows](/Nimble+Shadow "Dark Souls 2 Nimble Shadow") in Flexile Sentry boss battle NG+ (SotFS: Also drops from [Nimble Shadows](/Nimble+Shadow "Dark Souls 2 Nimble Shadow") around the buildings near [Gavlan](/Gavlan "Dark Souls 2 Gavlan"))
  * Possible drop from [Suspicious Shadows](/Nimble+Shadow "Dark Souls 2 Nimble Shadow") in Earthen Peak.
  * Has been dropped on at least one occasion by the [Nimble Shadow](/Nimble+Shadow "Dark Souls 2 Nimble Shadow") in [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille")

### DS2 Malformed Claws Hints and Tips

  * The easiest way to get them (along with the shadow items) is to wear all clothes that increase item discovery, along with the gold covetous serpent ring (preferably +2)
  * Useful for dual wielding and power stance, recommend to buff with Poison. although not as devastating as [Channeler's Trident](/Channeler%27s+Trident "Dark Souls 2 Channeler%27s Trident"), this is the best fist weapon for inflicting Poison.
  * R2 strong attack is a piercing stab and then press R2 again for a leaping attack, identical to default [Claws](/Claws "Dark Souls 2 Claws"), while being inferior on scaling and having no bleed build up, this one is shield piercing.
