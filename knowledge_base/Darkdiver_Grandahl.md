### Darkdiver Grandahl Dialogue

**\- When encountered the first time**  
Ahh, look how far this Undead has wandered.  
And a very fit Undead you are.  
A bit too alive, but with a darkish shadow. Yet still unprepared. For a deeper Dark.  
And like every Undead, you have no future.  
Ooh, my, don't mind me. I'm just talking amongst myself.  
But if you find a need for a truer Dark, then meet again, we shall.

**\- When talking a second time during the first encounter**  
The Dark is still nascent within you. May the Dark shine your way…  
(or)  
May we meet again, somewhere, some time…

**\- When encountered a second time**  
Young Undead, don't let this curse weigh upon you.  
We meet a second time. Perhaps you will yet traverse the Dark.  
Young Undead, if you truly seek the Dark, then we will surely meet again.

**\- When talking a second time during the second encounter**  
The Dark is still nascent within you. May the Dark shine your way…  
(or)  
May we meet again, somewhere, some time…

**\- When encountered a third time / Original request to join covenant**  
We meet again, young Undead.  
You have the look of a true seeker.  
I am Darkdiver Grandahl, seeker of Dark, giver of Dark.  
If you seek true Dark, I will grant it to you. As much as you desire.  
Well, then…Is Dark what you wish for?

  1. **Answer "yes"**  
There you are, you are now a Pilgrim of Dark.  
The Dark Chasm beckons you.  
Those drawn to the Dark are destined to seek it.
  2. **Answer "no"**  
Hmm…Perhaps I was wrong.  
No, no, just ignore me.  
Young Undead, may the Dark shine your way.

**\- Second request to join covenant**  
We meet again, young Undead.  
Do you wish to be guided by Dark?

  1. **Answer "yes"**  
There you are, you are now a Pilgrim of Dark.  
The Dark Chasm beckons you.  
Those drawn to the Dark are destined to seek it.
  2. **Answer "no"**  
Then choose your own path.

**\- When talking to him to open the interaction menu before opening entrance to Dark Chasm of Old**  
Finally, you are here, young Undead.  
Now, open the depths of darkness.  
Young Undead, the Dark awaits you.

**\- When talking to him to open the interaction menu after opening entrance to Dark Chasm of Old**  
Young Undead, what do you desire?

**\- When leaving**  
May the Dark shine your way.

**\- When walking off without closing the menu**  
As you wish, yes, as you wish.

**\- When offering humanity effigy**  
The mouth to the Dark Chasm is not normally open.  
If you seek the Dark, young Undead, you must offer a human effigy.

  1. **Answer "yes"**  
Young Undead, may the Dark shine your way.
  2. **Answer "no"**  
Yes, very well, as you wish.

**\- Using 'Talk' option**  
The embrace of the Dark is gentle. Let it absorb your sorrows, forever.

**\- Reach Rank 1 in the Pilgrims of the Dark covenant**  
Young Undead, the Dark beset upon you runs deeper than I had imagined.  
Let us see just how much Dark you can endure.  
You have seen Dark that has existed from times long past.  
What once was a great void of darkness became but fragments.  
But slowly, the scattered fragments grew, absorbing all things.  
It is we who will be pilgrims to these sacred sites.

**\- Reach Rank 2 in the Pilgrims of the Dark covenant**  
I knew that you were special.  
You are a true Pilgrim of Dark.  
There is more Dark within you than even you know.  
Dark is the mother of all. All things were born from it.

**\- Reach Rank 3 in the Pilgrims of the Dark covenant**  
Young Undead, you've discovered the truest Dark within you.  
A deep, deep Dark it is.  
The Dark that we must all face.  
We need the Abyss, more now than ever.

**\- When giving equipment to the player**  
Young Undead, my work is done…  
I bequeath these to you. Take them on your pilgrimage…

**\- When attacked and aggroed**  
Young Undead, do you expect me to just keel over?

**\- When killing the player**  
The Dark within you is faded and pale…

**\- When killed**  
The Dark…how could you…
