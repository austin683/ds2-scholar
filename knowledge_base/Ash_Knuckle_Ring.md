### DS2 Ash Knuckle Ring Tips and Notes

  * Particularly useful during the Royal Rat Vanguard fight. However, this ring is usually picked up after that fight, as it is rather inconveniently placed. You can jump the bridge to grab this ring before said boss fight. This can be accomplished by going down further in the hole in Majula and grabbing it before The Gutter. Make sure you are prepared to deal with fall damage.
