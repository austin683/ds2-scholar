**Petrification** is a [Status Effect](/Status+Effects "Dark Souls 2 Status Effects") in **Dark Souls 2**. It cannot be utilized by the player in any way, and is instead a constant danger as once procced it will immediately kill the player character by turning them to stone. The player has an innate Petrification Resistance stat affected by [Adaptability](/Adaptability "Dark Souls 2 Adaptability") and [Vigor](/Vigor "Dark Souls 2 Vigor"), and other sources for Petrification Resistance will have to come from spells and equipment, at 900 Petrification Resistance the player will become immune to the Status Effect.

### Dark Souls 2 Petrification Guide

In order to become fully petrified, the buildup meter must be filled, and once it has the player will be immediately killed, completely bypassing HP. Petrification functions in a similar way to how [Curse](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/curse "Dark Souls 2 curse") did in _Dark Souls_ , and how [Curse](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Curse "Dark Souls 2 Curse") does in the sequel _Dark Souls 3_. The _Elden Ring_ equivalent would be [Death Blight](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Death+Blight "Dark Souls 2 Death Blight"). Unique to petrification is that players turned to stone can be seen in other player's worlds, much like bloodstains. Dying from petrification also has the debilitating side effect of temporarily losing 20% of the player's maximum health, contributing to [Hollowing](/Hollowing "Dark Souls 2 Hollowing"). Hollowing can only be mitigated with the [Ring of Binding](/Ring+of+Binding "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Binding"), or removed by using a [Human Effigy](/Human+Effigy "Dark Souls 2 Human Effigy"). Also see [Vendrick's Blessing](/Vendrick's+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick's Blessing") for a way to completely remove becoming Hollow.
