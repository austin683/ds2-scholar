### Memory of the King Walkthrough

The memory of the king can be activated by approaching the pile of clothes in [Vendrick's](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick") boss room. You do not need to kill [Vendrick](/Vendrick "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick"). Once you activate the pile you are brought to the boss room before Vendrick became hollowed. Here you can talk to Vendrick and will talk about the crowns and your quest. If the player visit Vendrick after obtaining each of the Crowns from the DLCs, Vendrick dialogue will have new lines.   
  
**Dialogue:**   
  
_As flame rises, so does it fade. Such is the way of things._   
_Do you intend to link the fire? Then you must first take the throne._   
_Prove your worth. Find the ancient crowns. Seek adversity, and they will be yours. And your wishes, granted.  
  
_ If the player has the [King's Crown](/King%27s+Crown "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Crown"), it continues like this: _  
_  
_The fire..._   
_Coveter of the throne... I am Vendrick, ruler of Drangleic._   
_Seeker of fire... deliverer of crowns..._   
_What do you see in the flames? Find the crowns, and your own answers._   
_The crowns hold the strength of lords from times long past._   
_Seek adversity. As befits you, seeker of fire, coveter of the throne._   
_I'm no king. I am more fit to be a jester. I was unaware of my own blindness._   
_We are feeble vessels, with feebler souls._   
_We would cast aside the prop of life, only to face greater hardship._   
_Are you another such fool? Or something more?_   
_I fail to see your design, young moth._   
_I fail to see your design, wee moth._   
_But I see very little these days._

If the player has the [Crown of the Sunken King](/Crown+of+the+Sunken+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Sunken King Helm") and the [King's Crown](/King%27s+Crown "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Crown"), it continues like this:   
  
_Seeker of fire, conquerer of Dark. I too sought fire, once._   
_With fire, they say, a true king can harness the curse._   
_A lie, but I knew no better._   
_Seeker of fire, you know not the depth of Dark within you._   
_It grows deeper still, the more flame you covet._   
_Flame, oh flame, I am king of this wretched unravelled kingdom._   
_I subdued the giants, and claimed their strength, so that I might step closer to fire._   
_Drangleic will fall. The fire will fade, and the souls of old will reamerge._   
_With Dark unshackled, a curse will be upon us._   
_And men will take their true shape._

If the player has the [King's Crown](/King%27s+Crown "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Crown"), the [Crown of the Sunken King](/Crown+of+the+Sunken+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Sunken King Helm") and the [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King Helm"), it continues like this:   
  
_Seeker of fire, I see you've subdued another foul creature._   
_One of the Father of the Abyss' spawn. That confounded quintessence of Humanity._   
_The abyss once had form, but then disappated. And yet traces of its existence endured._   
_Each fragment, thirsting for power, spread Dark with no relent._   
_My dear Shandra, was one such fragment._   
_The feeble, tiny thing that thirsted for power more than any other. Driven by unsatiable lust for a worthy vessel._   
_Fire came to be, and with it disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, light and dark._   
_Dark was seen as a curse. Shadow is not cast, but born of fire._   
_And the brighter the flame, the deeper the shadow._   
_Inherit fire, and harness the dark. Such is the calling of a true leader._

If the player has the [King's Crown](/King%27s+Crown "Dark Souls 2 King%27s Crown"), the [Crown of the Sunken King](/Crown+of+the+Sunken+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Sunken King Helm"), the [Crown of the Old Iron King](/Crown+of+the+Old+Iron+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Old Iron King Helm") and the [Crown of the Ivory King](/Crown+of+the+Ivory+King+Helm "Dark Souls 2 Crown of the Ivory King Helm"), it continues like this:   
  
_One day fire will fade, and dark will become a curse._   
_Men will be free from death, left to wander eternally._   
_Dark will again be ours, and in our true shape, we can bury the false legends of yore._   
_Only... is this our only choice?_   
_Seeker of fire, coveter of the throne, seek strength. The rest will follow._   
  
Vendrick will then grant the player [Vendrick's Blessing](/Vendrick%27s+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Vendrick%27s Blessing"). When dying while wearing any of the Crowns the player won't turn hollow, similar the the [Ring of Life Protection](/Ring+of+Life+Protection "Dark Souls 2 Ring of Life Protection"), but will still have to recover lost souls. The player also becomes immune to the curse effect. The blessing is lost upon going into the next playthrough, and you must obtain the crowns again in the next playthrough to recieve the blessing again.
