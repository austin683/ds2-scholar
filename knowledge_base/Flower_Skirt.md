_Skirt of a nameless troubadour._   
_High durability, despite its appearance._   
  
_While troubadours can get by on their own through wily use of their arts for the most part, they might still require a generous patron._   
_The stunning arrangement of layered flowers on this skirt is designed to capture the attention of a candidate for the position._

###  Location

  * Found in a chest in [Cave of the Dead](/Cave+of+the+Dead "Dark Souls 2 Cave of the Dead"), past boss fight and just before the exit to [Dragon's Sanctum](/Dragon's+Sanctum "Dark Souls 2 Dragon's Sanctum").

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Upgraded stats are only 50% higher and physical defenses are only 25% higher.
  * Grants +2 to VGR and +1 to END.
  * Unusually high durability for a cloth.
