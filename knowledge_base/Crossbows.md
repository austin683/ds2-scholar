**Crossbows** in **[Dark Souls II](/Dark+Souls+2+Wiki "Dark Souls 2 Wiki")** are a type of ranged [Weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") that's also similar to [Bows](/Bows "Dark Souls 2 Bows") but fire crossbow bolts as ammunition instead of arrows. When wielded with one hand, Crossbows can still fired using the auto-aim feature, but to manually aim, players would need to wield the weapon with two hands. Crossbows can also be powerstanced which allows players to fire both weapons at once. The rate of fire is considerably faster than Bows, but the reload animation is what slows down Crossbows. Crossbows are also set apart by their physical damage with crossbow bolts. Infusing crossbow bolts can also prove to be effective but note that it cannot be infused with Bleed or Poison. This page covers a list of all Crossbows in Dark Souls 2. Bolts fired are not effected by [Flynn's Ring](/Flynn's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Flynn's Ring").
