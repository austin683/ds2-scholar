### Dark Souls 2 Seed of a Tree of Giants Usage

  * Online play item, makes enemies attack invaders. It is a single-use item that is consumed when used.
  * Note that it _**will also attack Blue Sentinels**_ that come to your aid if they are summoned when you are in the Way of the Blue covenant.

### Seed of a Tree of Giants Location in Dark Souls 2

  * Begin with one as a [gift](/Gifts "Dark Souls 2 Gifts").
  * After some time or requirements (not sure yet) spawns in one of the arms of the dead giant next to the Soldier's Rest bonfire in [Forest of Fallen Giants](/Forest+of+Fallen+Giants "Dark Souls 2 Forest of Fallen Giants"). The chances are believed to be 10% for a seed to spawn, which increases by another 10% every time the player is invaded until a seed spawns. You can trigger the spawn by continuously dying against a dark phantom... It's easier to just check all the giant trees for one. They'll spawn randomly at a random tree.

  1. [It appears a seed spawns roughly every four invasions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/2jvhqh/findings_from_farming_97_seed_of_a_tree_of_giants)

### DKS2 Seed of a Tree of Giants Notes and Tips

  * Notes and tips go here.
  * Can be farmed using the Forlorn spawn outside the Kings' door in the Forest of Fallen Giants, Do not kill the Forlorn as he will not respawn after defeat.
  * Tested Sotfs, seed appears to spawn more frequently than the above cited four invasions and appears to spawn only on the Soldiers' Rest Giants tree.
