**Demon's Great Hammer** is a [weapon](/Weapons "Dark Souls 2 Weapons") in **Dark Souls 2**. **Demon's Great Hammer** can be considered one of the best early-game options. However wielding it efficiently demands a substantial investment in [Strength](/Strength "Dark Souls 2 Strength"). Opting for two-handed use halves the strength requirement, lowering it to 25, making the **Demon's Great Hammer** more accessible for those focusing on strength-based builds.

> Great hammer made of unknown materials. Perhaps it is stone, or even wood.   
>   
>  The origins of its name are unclear. Its tremendous weight suggests that it was never intended for humans. Perhaps it was an offering to the demons that appear in legend. 

### How to get Demon's Great Hammer in Dark Souls 2

  * Trade with [Dyna and Tillo](/Dyna+and+Tillo "Dark Souls 2 Dyna and Tillo") in Things Betwixt. ([Petrified Something](/Petrified+Something "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Something") gives you the best odds.)

###  DS2 Demon's Great Hammer Hints and Tips:

  * Upgraded with [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). Cannot be infused with Bleed.

  * This could be one of the best weapons you can get at the start of the game, but be warned that you will need a lot of strength to wield it. Wielding a weapon in two hands halves the strength requirement, meaning that you will only need 25 str to 2-hand the Demon's Great Hammer.

### DS2 Demon's Great Hammer Trivia:

  * Belonged to, or at least was wielded by, the Asylum Demon in Dark Souls 1
  * Demon weapon built from the stone archtrees. Used by lesser demons at North Undead Asylum (item description from DS1)
  * Similar to DS1, the weapon can be obtained via a bird's nest
