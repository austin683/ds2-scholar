_"Black Robe belonged to Straid of Olaphis._

_Straid was invited to the old kingdom of Olaphis for his wisdom, but its depth was such that people soon feared him, and in the end Straid was led into a dreadful trap._

_Straid spent several lifetimes as stone. During this hiatus, kingdoms rose and fell, until the land called Drangleic came to be."_

### Location

  * Obtained from [Straid of Olaphis](/Straid+of+Olaphis "Dark Souls 2 Straid of Olaphis") by trading him 4 boss souls and speaking to him.
  * Sold by [Merchant Hag Melentia](/Merchant+Hag+Melentia "Dark Souls 2 Merchant Hag Melentia") in [Majula](/Majula "Dark Souls 2 Majula") if you killed Straid. Progress through story.
