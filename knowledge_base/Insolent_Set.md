**Insolent Set** is an Attire or Armor in **Dark Souls 2**. Armor sets do not provide specific benefits, so players are free to mix and match their preferred parts to optimize their [Builds](/Character+Builds "Dark Souls 2 Character Builds").

  
  
_"Helmet/Armor/Gauntlets/Leggings worn by once-proud clerics._   
_Relics of a party who long ago attempted to conquer the Undead Crypt._   
_For this sin their deaths have been postponed, so they may serve as crypt sentries."_

###  Set Location

  * Sold by [Grave Warden Agdayne](/Grave+Warden+Agdayne "Dark Souls 2 Grave Warden Agdayne") (27,9k) in [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"). 
    * [Scholar of The First Sin] Pieces are dropped by any of the 11 [Insolent Spirits](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits") that spawn throughout Undead Crypt once two sconces next to Undead Ditch bonfire are lit. Spirits do not respawn and drops are not fixed (except for 2 – see the corresponding page), so [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") might be required to farm the entire set.

###  Notes

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite").
  * Helm grants +2 to Faith.
  * Although it doesn't look exactly the same, the chestpiece can be used to cosplay _Solaire of Astora_ from  _Dark Souls_.
