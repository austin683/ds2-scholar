This page contains a list of all the bosses that are either optional or can be skipped in any playthrough, as well as those that are non-optional.   
  
**Note:** The [Shrine of Winter](/Shrine+of+Winter "Dark Souls 2 Shrine of Winter") will open after you either light 4 Primordial Bonfires, or have a Soul Memory of 1,000,000 souls (in NG, see page for more details). This in turn allows you to skip every boss that isn't in [Drangleic Castle](/Drangleic+Castle "Dark Souls 2 Drangleic Castle") and beyond.

  * In version 1.0? of the game (xbox360 only?) you could even skip the Shrine of Winter without 1,000,000 Soul Memory. It's an out of bounds path involving a series of jumps in the mounds around the entrance, ending up on the other side of the rubble that's blocking the path behind the Sentry mini-boss.

    
    
    | The Last Giant Area boss of the Forest of Fallen Giants . / Defeating this boss gives you the Soldiers Key to access the Pursuer boss, and to reach the King's Gate to The Place Unbeknownst . / This boss is somewhat optional, since you can reach the Place Unbeknownst by a tricky jump. The Place Unbeknownst can be reached by jumping from the castle wall in front of the bonfire down to the wooden platform below. The jump is tricky, but allows you to reach the Memory of Jeigh without the Soldiers Key . You can also skip the Pursuer, since there's another path to the Lost Bastille . See the Pursuer below for details. |
    | --- |
    | The Pursuer Second boss of the Forest of Fallen Giants . / This boss can also be defeated early in Forest of Fallen Giants , but you still need the Soldiers Key to access the boss area. Another one can be fought upon returning to the Smelter Demon 's location, and there are also two of them at Drangleic Castle 's throne room in NG+. / This boss can be skipped if you don't need the Soul of a Giant from the Memory of Orro , or the path to the Tower Apart Bonfire in Lost Bastille . To reach Lost Bastille you can take the path through Heide's Tower of Flame and No Man's Wharf . The Pursuers at Iron Keep and Drangleic Castle are completely optional. |
    | Dragonrider First Boss of Heide's Tower of Flame . / This boss must be killed to access Huntsman's Copse and No-Man's Wharf . Optional boss if you open the Shrine of Winter with a high enough Soul Memory. |
    | Old Dragonslayer Boss behind the fog gate across a large drawbridge, dropped by pulling a nearby lever, at Heide's Tower Of Flame . / This boss is completely optional since defeating it only provides access to the Blue Sentinels Covenant. |
    | Flexile Sentry Area boss of No-man's Wharf . Accessed by ringing a bell atop the Wharf that docks a ship. / This boss is optional if you go to Lost Bastille from the Pursuer area in the Forest of Fallen Giants . |
    | Ruin Sentinels Yahim, Ricce and Alessia Area boss of Lost Bastille . / Can be skipped via a Pharros Wall Contraption, then an illusionary wall. You also need the Antiquated Key to reach this area, accessed through a locked door behind a boarded up door in the Lost Bastille courtyard. The Antiquated Key is found close to the Bonfire Apart in Lost Bastille , but this area can also be reached from the main Lost Bastille area. See the Antiquated Key for details. |
    | Belfry Gargoyles Bosses of Belfry Luna . / This area and boss is completely optional. |
