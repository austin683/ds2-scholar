### Aldia's Keep Walkthrough

### From the Gates

As you enter through the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") doors, by wearing the [King's Ring](/King's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King's Ring") you acquired in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"), on left, near a tree, is a corpse with [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). In a corner to the right of the stairs that lead further into the are, there is a corpse with [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed"). There is a roaming pack of [Prowler Hounds](/Prowler+Hound "Dark Souls 2 Prowler Hound") in the tall grass that inflict bleed and petrification. Another corpse, closer to the middle of the tall grass has 10x [Poison Throwing Knife](/Poison+Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Poison Throwing Knife"), with a corpse visible a few feet away holding 3x [Alluring Skull ](/Alluring+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Alluring Skull"). If you follow the bridge to the left you come across a [Mimic](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic") that contains a [Malformed Skull](/Malformed+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Malformed Skull") and [Dark Mask](/Dark+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Dark Armor").

In a little wooden hut nearby, is **[the Foregarden bonfire](/Foregarden "Dark Souls 2 Foregarden")**. You may meet [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah") here, if you kept her alive during three earlier boss fights, she will reward you with her sword and armor: [Mirrah Greatsword](/Mirrah+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Mirrah Greatsword"), [Lucatiel's Set](/Lucatiel%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel%27s Set").

### Brother from another Mirrah

Go up the stairs and drop into the fountain to loot a corpse with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). Continue up the stairs and go the left corner of the building’s doorway. Loot the corpse with [Twilight Herb](/Twilight+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Twilight Herb") x1. Walk through the building triggers the invasion of the black phantom, [Aslatiel of Mirrah](/Aslatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Aslatiel of Mirrah").

After defeating him, the moving carriage next to you holds a [Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk"). You can lure an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") (found in the next room) over to break it, and it does not reset until NG+, or until you have burnt a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). Although, this is not recommended, as invaders can use this to annoy the host -or if that works in your favour, go for it.

### Dead Undead Dragon Hall

Upon entering you are greeted by an impressive and imposing dragon’s skeleton, that doesn't not attack the player unless all four sconces in the area are lit; lighting each sconce summons the [Forlorn](/Forlorn "Dark Souls 2 Forlorn") invader (Note: these does NOT count as an invasion and do not count towards unlocking the [Forlorn Set](/Forlorn+Set "Dark Souls 2 Forlorn Set") or Weapons for Straid. They are compareable to the [Insolent Spirits](/Insolent+Spirits "Dark Souls 2 Insolent Spirits")). We will come across the necessary sconces while exploring the area, so for now, loot the corpse right in front of the dragon skeleton for a [Fading Soul](/Fading+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Fading Soul"). After the player lights all four sconces, and returns to the Skeleton Dragon, it will lunge forward. Run out of the room as soon as you see him move, and after his head lunge, he will die and drop [Aldia's Key](/Aldia's+Key "Dark Souls 2 Aldia's Key"). 

Walk straight ahead past the skeleton's skull will lead us to the first sconce and further down to a branching path. Following the way to the right, we will end up at a magical barrier, behind which you will find [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan"). If you talk to him while being human, he will seem to be frightened by something and tell you to leave him alone, as nothing good will come from spending time with him. If you are hollow instead, he will show his other personality, that of being an assassin (and the reason why he locked himself in here). If you want to do his side quest, do NOT free him, more details about his questiline can be found on his wiki page. If you still want to free him, you will find the lever on the left of the 3 archways, the way being filled with messages to back of and to not pull the lever. Beware though, that freeing him will cause his assassin-self to invade you in different places. He also acts as an merchant, either by releasing him (only a merchant while in human form) or by completing his questline (only a merchant while hollowed).

### Mirror, Mirror...Mirror

After talking with our friend with the split personality, go up the stairs then head right, ignoring the stairs to your left momentarily. Once you enter this area with the mirrors ahead, do a U-turn to your right and you will first encounter a [Red Crystal Lizard](/Crystal+Lizard "Dark Souls 2 Crystal Lizard"), and a chest containing the [Great Magic Barrier](/Great+Magic+Barrier "Dark Souls 2 Great Magic Barrier"), at the end. Go back down the hallway and you walk into a room of mirrors. Three of which will break and release a [Looking Glass Varlet](/Looking+Glass+Varlet "Dark Souls 2 Looking Glass Varlet") each, out of the mirrors. One of the mirrors in the middle contain a body holding a [Large Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Large+Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Brave Warrior"). A corpse in this room holds a [Northern Ritual Ring +2](/Northern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Northern Ritual Band") and a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). The chest in this area contains a [Brightbug](/Brightbug "Dark Souls 2 Brightbug"). On the left of the room, near to the dragon skeleton, there will also be the summon sign for [Sellsword Luet](/Sellsword+Luet "Dark Souls 2 Sellsword Luet").

### Free the Beasts

Return to the stairs we ignored earlier and head up them to find a petrified [Ogre,](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") who you can revive it with a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore"). You can lure him to the carriages to break them, releasing the [Basilisks](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") inside. After you have finished taking your Ogre for a walk, you can kill him to make him drop a [Dragon Acolyte Mask](/Dragon+Acolyte+Mask "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Acolyte Mask"). Beware though, that this Ogre does not respawn. Take the next flight of stairs up to find yourself in the next section with the caged (and respawning) [Giant Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk").

Alternatively, you can safe yourself the [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") and take the staircase to the left instead. You will end up at the same section with the caged [Great Basilisk](/Great+Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Great Basilisk"), surrounded by petrified people. Attacking it makes it aggro and possibly destroy the cage. To alleviate the risk, take care of it with range from a distance. A corpse in front of where it’s cage was holds a [Crimson Water](/Crimson+Water "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Water"). Head to the right side of cage to find a hallway that leads to an iron chest with 2x [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic") as well as another sconce on the way to the chest. Return to where the cage of the [Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk"), and walk through into the next room.

### First a Skeleton, Now a Statue

A statue of a dragon greets you in the center of the room and behind it a shut door. Pull the lever dangling from its mouth to open the door into the next room. This also shuts the door you came in through so if you need to return back through, pull the lever again. In the next room there is a Pharros contraption wall and a corpse under a table, with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). Using the [Pharros Lockstone ](/Pharros+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros Lockstone") here greatly illuminates the area, giving you better visibility for the ambush ahead. Having the hallway illuminated also lets you take a better looked on the different enemies trapped in the cages above you.

### Shrek 3

At the end of this hallway, an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") trapped in a suspended cage can be seen. You can walk past most caged enemies in this area. There are two [Dragon Acolyte](/Dragon+Acolyte "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Acolyte") lurking behind the paintings, the paintings can be shot down with arrows, making the Acolytes come out of their hiding spots. Near the second Acolyte, there is a corpse under a table, which you can pick up to receive a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). The door on the left close by will lead to laboratory.

Destroying the bookcases on the right after entering the room will reveal a [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone"). At the middle of going down the stairs, there is an illusory wall to the left, revealing the **Ritual Site****Bonfire.** Going all the way down lets us reach the third brazier and an acid pool with 2 [Swollen Mongrel](/Swollen+Mongrel "Dark Souls 2 Swollen Mongrel"). After taking care of them, don't forget to unequip all items, then dive in to have a little acid bath (as a refresher, acid does not hurt you, but does great damage to any equipment you wear). Inside the pool ,you will find (from left to right): a [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and 4x[Corrosive Urn](/Corrosive+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Corrosive Urn"); 2x [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing"); and [Soul Geyser](/Soul+Geyser "Dark Souls 2 Soul Geyser") and a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). After taking all the items, remember to reequip everything and head back to the hallway.

Continuing to the left, we will come across a locked door on the right side. This locked door can be opened later with the key we get from the Dragon Skeleton once all 4 braziers are lit. Further down the hallway there is a caged Ogre blocking the way, it is recommended to take care of him now, since another Ogre will breach through the big iron door behind him and has the potential to free his Ogre friend. On the left there are 3 petrified corpses, the final brazier, as well as a pair of big, locked iron doors. These can be smashed open by one of the Ogres, so lure one here and let him open the door for you Obelix' style (any comparison with Obelix and an Ogre not intended). Behind the now opened gates lies a chest containing a [Malformed Shell](/Malformed+Shell "Dark Souls 2 Malformed Shell"). Further down the hall, the door on the left opens to a little butcher room with another Acolyte. The hole in this room leads back into the acid pool form before. 

### Journey to the Dragon Boss

Going through the doors the Ogre breached from leads to a room with another closed door on the right (leading to the same room as the door before) and an iron door in the front. Going through these iron doors, we are entering a less illuminated room with an item to the right and another door in front of us. Trying to get closer to the door or item will make another Ogre breach through said doors. After taking care of him, take the [Simpleton's Spice](/Simpleton's+Spice "Dark Souls 2 Simpleton's Spice") and [Twilight Herb](/Twilight+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Twilight Herb") from the corpse. Through the hole the Ogre made, we can already reach the Fog Gate to the boss, but lets take a little detour first.

Since we lit up all the sconces now, head back to Dragon Skeleton. Be wary though, it will try to attack you, after the one attack though, it will crumble and leave the [Aldia's Key](/Aldia's+Key "Dark Souls 2 Aldia's Key") behind. With this key, we can now open the two locked doors in the hallway.

This room has four [Dragon Acolytes](/Dragon+Acolyte "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Acolyte"), a caged [Belfry Gargoyle](/Belfry+Gargoyle "Dark Souls 2 Belfry Gargoyle"), three chests (which are all [Mimics](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic")) and an [Aldia Warlock](/Aldia+Warlock "Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock"), and a lever that allows you to drop all the hanging cages from the hall before. After taking care of the Acolytes and the Warlock, take the [Soul of a Proud Knight](/Soul+of+a+Proud+Knight "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Proud Knight") from the table right across the door you entered this room, and a [Large Soul of a Brave Warrior](/Large+Soul+of+a+Brave+Warrior "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Brave Warrior") at the right corner at the very end of this room. The 3 Mimics here contain (in order from the first locked door to the second door): 2x [Cracked Red Eye Orb](/Cracked+Red+Eye+Orb "Dark Souls 2 Cracked Red Eye Orb"); 1x [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"); and 3x [Wilted Dusk Herb](/Wilted+Dusk+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Wilted Dusk Herb").

If you use the lever to drop the cages, a [Mimic](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic") holding a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore"), another monster will drop 3x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). The [Giant Poison Brumer](/Poison+Brumer "Dark Souls 2 Poison Brumer") will drop a [Corrosive Urn](/Corrosive+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Corrosive Urn"), a further mimic will drop the [Black Witch's Staff](/Black+Witch%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch%27s Staff"). [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan") dark spirit will also invade here if you freed him earlier.   
  
Once you have done everything you want in this area, head through fog gate to fight the [Guardian Dragon](/Guardian+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Guardian Dragon").

BOSS FIGHT: [Guardian Dragon](/Guardian+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Guardian Dragon")

After defeating the boss, exit the arena to pick up [Dragon Scale](/Dragon+Scale "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Scale") from a corpse and take the elevator to [Dragon Aerie](/Dragon+Aerie "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Aerie").

### Aldia's Keep Walkthrough

### From the Gates

As you enter through the [Shaded Woods](/Shaded+Woods "Dark Souls 2 Shaded Woods") doors, by wearing the [King's Ring](/King's+Ring "Dark Souls 2 King's Ring") you acquired in the [Undead Crypt](/Undead+Crypt "Dark Souls 2 Undead Crypt"), on left is a corpse with [Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Soul of a Nameless Soldier") and [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone"). To the right behind stairs in corner, is a corpse with [Fire Seed](/Fire+Seed "Dark Souls 2 Fire Seed"). There is a roaming pack of Prowler Hounds in the tall grass that inflict bleed and petrification. Another corpse, closer to the middle of the tall grass has 10x [Poison Throwing Knife](/Poison+Throwing+Knife "Dark Souls 2 Poison Throwing Knife"), with a corpse visible a few feet away holding 3x [Alluring Skull ](/Alluring+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Alluring Skull"). If you follow the ridge to the left you come across a [Mimic](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic") that contains a [Malformed Skull](/Malformed+Skull "Dark Souls 2 Malformed Skull") and [Dark Mask](/Dark+Armor "Dark Souls 2 Dark Armor").

In a little wooden hut to the left of the stairs up to the big structure ahead, is **[the Foregarden bonfire](/Foregarden "Dark Souls 2 Foregarden")**. You may meet [Lucatiel of Mirrah](/Lucatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel of Mirrah") here, if you kept her alive during three earlier boss fights, she will reward you with her sword and armor: [Mirrah Greatsword](/Mirrah+Greatsword "Dark Souls 2 Mirrah Greatsword"), [Lucatiel's Set](/Lucatiel%27s+Set "Dark Souls 2 Lucatiel%27s Set").

### Brother from another Mirrah

Go up the stairs and drop into the fountain to loot a corpse with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). Continue up the stairs and go the left corner of the building’s doorway. Loot the corpse for a [Twilight Herb](/Twilight+Herb "Dark Souls 2 Twilight Herb"). Walk into the building to trigger the invasion of the black phantom, [Aslatiel of Mirrah](/Aslatiel+of+Mirrah "Dark Souls 2 Aslatiel of Mirrah").

After defeating him, the moving carriage next to you holds a [Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk"). You can lure an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") over to break it, and it does not reset until NG+, or until you have burnt a [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). Although, this is not recommended, as invaders can use this to annoy the host -or if that works in your favour, go for it.

### Dead Undead Dragon Hall

Upon entering you are greeted by an impressive and imposing dragon’s skeleton, that lunges forward if you get too close. Run out of the room as soon as you see him move, and after his head lunge, he will die and drop [Aldia's Key](/Aldia's+Key "Dark Souls 2 Aldia's Key"). Loot the corpse on the ground in front of the dragon for a [Fading Soul](/Fading+Soul "Dark Souls 2 Fading Soul"). 

Walk straight ahead and into the 3 archways. If you make a left you will encounter several messages on the ground imploring you to pull back. At the end of a hallway is a lever; pulling this lever will free [Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan"), canceling out a side quest and loot. This also allows him to invade you**dark spirit in multiple areas from now on**. If you do pull the lever, go back and down the opposite hallway where you meet the now free [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan"). He talks to you briefly and becomes available as a merchant. If instead of doing this you visit him as hollow, **without pulling the lever** , you will activate his side quest. For more information, click [here](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan").

### Mirror, Mirror...Mirror

Go up the stairs then head right, ignoring the stairs to your left momentarily. Once you enter this area with the mirrors ahead, do a U-turn to your right and you will encounter a chest containing the [Great Magic Barrier](/Great+Magic+Barrier "Dark Souls 2 Great Magic Barrier"), at the end. Go back down the hallway and you walk into a room of mirrors. Three of which will break and release a hostile phantom each, out of the mirrors. A corpse in this room holds a [Northern Ritual Ring +2](/Northern+Ritual+Band "Dark Souls 2 Northern Ritual Band") and a [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone").

### Free the Beasts

Return to the stairs we ignored earlier and head up them to find a petrified [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre"). Revive it with a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore") for the complete experience. Take the next flight of stairs up to find yourself in the next section with the [Giant Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk").

Alternatively, take the staircase to the left of the cyclops to go one level up to where you see a [Giant Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk") in a cage, surrounded by petrified people. Attacking it makes it aggro and possibly destroy the cage. To alleviate the risk, take care of it with range from a distance. Killing it may yield a [Magic Stone](/Magic+Stone "Dark Souls 2 Magic Stone") or [Dragon Sage Hood](/Dragon+Sage+Hood "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Sage Hood"). A corpse in front of where it’s cage was holds a [Crimson Water](/Crimson+Water "Dark Souls 2 Crimson Water"). Head to the right side of cage to find a hallway that leads to an iron chest with 2x [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic"). Return to where the cage of the [Basilisk](/Basilisk "Dark Souls 2 Basilisk"), and walk through into the next room.

### First a Skeleton, Now a Statue

A statue of a dragon greets you in the center of the room and behind it a shut door. Pull the lever dangling from its mouth to open the door into the next room. This also shuts the door you came in through so if you need to return back through, pull the lever again. In the next room there is a Pharros contraption wall and a corpse under a table, with a [Radiant Lifegem](/Radiant+Lifegem "Dark Souls 2 Radiant Lifegem"). Using a [Pharros Lockstone ](/Pharros+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros Lockstone") here greatly illuminates the area, giving you better visibility for the ambush ahead.

### Shrek 3

At the end of this hallway, an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") trapped in a suspended cage can be seen. You can walk past most caged enemies in this area. There are two [Dragon Acolyte](/Dragon+Acolyte "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Acolyte") lurking behind the paintings. They can also be be provoked by attacking the paintings. There is also a locked door that will be breached by an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") here; he can smash through the chained door on the left side of the hall which is locked (revealing a chest with a [Malformed Shell](/Malformed+Shell "Dark Souls 2 Malformed Shell")) and can break walls for you if you time it right. The [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") can also free the caged monsters.

To the left is a disposal pit leading to the acid cell below, this room has an acolyte in it. The disposal pit can be reached by taking the door opposite the second painting -in which an acolyte burst out of. Before heading down, you want to do two things:

  1. A [Pharros' Lockstone](/Pharros%27+Lockstone "Dark Souls 2 Pharros%27 Lockstone") is in the lab behind the shelves on the right of the entrance. Just destroy them all.
  2. On the way down the stairs to the pit there is an illusory wall to the left that reveals the **[Ritual Site bonfire](/Ritual+Site "Dark Souls 2 Ritual Site")**.

Once down the stairs, you will reach the acid pit. It is recommended you kill these enemies using ranged attacks if possible, then remove all of your armor and rings to avoid corrosive damage in order to retrieve the [Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier](/Large+Soul+of+a+Nameless+Soldier "Dark Souls 2 Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier"), 4x [Corrosive Urn](/Corrosive+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Corrosive Urn"), 2x [Divine Blessing](/Divine+Blessing "Dark Souls 2 Divine Blessing"), [Soul Geyser](/Soul+Geyser "Dark Souls 2 Soul Geyser"), and [Petrified Dragon Bone](/Petrified+Dragon+Bone "Dark Souls 2 Petrified Dragon Bone").

### Journey to the Dragon Boss

To access the locked doors that are on the right side of the hall, you are required to light all 4 sconces in the area that trigger the event that re-animates the dragon skeleton in the first room. After opening these locked doors you can use this pathway to sneak behind one of the [Ogres](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") that break through a doorway. This room has four [Dragon Acolytes](/Dragon+Acolyte "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Acolyte"), and a [Gargoyle](/Gargoyle "Dark Souls 2 Gargoyle"), three [Mimics](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic") and an [Aldia Warlock](/Aldia+Warlock "Dark Souls 2 Aldia Warlock").

This room also contains a lever that allows you to drop all the hanging cages. If you attempt to run through this room, the [Acolytes](/Dragon+Acolyte "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Acolyte") will follow you and alert the [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre"). The next close door will have an [Ogre](/Ogre "Dark Souls 2 Ogre") behind it and will also burst through the wall as before.

If you use the lever to drop the cages, a [Mimic](/Mimic "Dark Souls 2 Mimic") holding a [Fragrant Branch of Yore](/Fragrant+Branch+of+Yore "Dark Souls 2 Fragrant Branch of Yore"), another monster will drop 3x [Twinkling Titanite](/Twinkling+Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Twinkling Titanite"). The [Giant Poison Brumer](/Poison+Brumer "Dark Souls 2 Poison Brumer") will drop a [Corrosive Urn](/Corrosive+Urn "Dark Souls 2 Corrosive Urn"), a further mimic will drop the [Black Witch's Staff](/Black+Witch%27s+Staff "Dark Souls 2 Black Witch%27s Staff"). [Royal Sorcerer Navlaan](/Royal+Sorcerer+Navlaan "Dark Souls 2 Royal Sorcerer Navlaan") dark spirit will also invade here if you freed him earlier. Once you get past him it is a straight run to the fog gate and on to the [Guardian Dragon](/Guardian+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Guardian Dragon").

BOSS FIGHT: [Guardian Dragon](/Guardian+Dragon "Dark Souls 2 Guardian Dragon")

After defeating the boss, exit the arena to pick up [Dragon Scale](/Dragon+Scale "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Scale") from a corpse and take the elevator to [Dragon Aerie](/Dragon+Aerie "Dark Souls 2 Dragon Aerie").
