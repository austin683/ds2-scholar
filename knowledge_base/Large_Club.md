### How to get Large Club in Dark Souls 2

  * [Lost Bastille](/Lost+Bastille "Dark Souls 2 Lost Bastille") \- Treasure from a Corpse next to chest in the corner beneath the [Servants' Quarters](/Servants%27+Quarters "Dark Souls 2 Servants%27 Quarters") bonfire, further duplicates can be obtained via the use of [Bonfire Ascetic](/Bonfire+Ascetic "Dark Souls 2 Bonfire Ascetic").
  * A +8 Large Club can be found in [Frozen Eleum Loyce](/Frozen+Eleum+Loyce "Dark Souls 2 Frozen Eleum Loyce"). From the Lower Garrison bonfire, go through the gate into the room that contains a white [Covetous Demon](/Covetous+Demon "Dark Souls 2 Covetous Demon") and you will find the Large Club in a corpse on the side.

### DS2 Large Club Hints and Tips:

  * Upgraded with regular [Titanite](/Titanite "Dark Souls 2 Titanite"). Cannot be infused with Bleed.
  * At Normal +10 with 50 Strength this weapon has an Attack Rating of 546 (360+186). So [Great Club](/Great+Club "Dark Souls 2 Great Club") is stronger, has 567 AR at same stats.
  * The Large and Great Club, both at 70 durability, have their durability go down really fast. Probably better suited for bosses or used with the [Bracing Knuckle Ring](/Bracing+Knuckle+Ring "Dark Souls 2 Bracing Knuckle Ring").
  * Switch between the Large Club and Great Club as you progress through a level and save the strongest weapon for the boss, swapping out as they become close to broken.
  * Does not inflict Poison like the counterpart in _Dark Souls_.
